He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. His work in the formative years of electric power development was involved in a corporate alternating current/direct current \"War of Currents\" as well as various patent battles. \n\nTesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project. In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.

It is related to, but distinct from taxonomy. Plant taxonomy is concerned with grouping and classifying plants; botanical nomenclature then provides names for the results of this process. The starting point for modern botanical nomenclature is Linnaeus' \"Species Plantarum\" of 1753. Botanical nomenclature is governed by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\" (\"ICN\"), which replaces the \"International Code of Botanical Nomenclature\" (\"ICBN\"). Fossil plants are also covered by the code of nomenclature. \n\nWithin the limits set by that code there is another set of rules, the \"International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP)\" which applies to plant cultivars that have been deliberately altered or selected by humans (see cultigen). \n\nBotanical nomenclature has a long history, going back beyond the period when Latin was the scientific language throughout Europe, to Theophrastus (c. 370\u2013287 BC), Dioscorides (c. 40 \u2013 90 AD) and other Greek writers. Many of these works have come down to us in Latin translations. The principal Latin writer on botany was Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 AD). From Mediaeval times, Latin became the universal scientific language (lingua franca) in Europe. Most written plant knowledge was the property of monks, particularly Benedictine, and the purpose of those early herbals was primarily medicinal rather than plant science \"per se\".

When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks.

In contrast, radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish have a topside and a downside, but no identifiable front or back. \n\nThe bilateria are a major group of animals, including the majority of phyla but not sponges, cnidarians, placozoans and ctenophores. For the most part, bilateral embryos are triploblastic, having three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Nearly all are bilaterally symmetrical, or approximately so; the most notable exception is the echinoderms, which achieve near-radial symmetry as adults, but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae. \n\nExcept for a few phyla (i.e. flatworms and gnathostomulids), bilaterians have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus. Some bilaterians lack body cavities (acoelomates, i.e. Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha and Gnathostomulida), while others display primary body cavities (deriving from the blastocoel, as pseudocoel) or secondary cavities (that appear \"de novo\", for example the coelom). \n\nThe hypothetical most recent common ancestor of all bilateria is termed the \"Urbilaterian\". The nature of the first bilaterian is a matter of debate. One side suggests that acoelomates gave rise to the other groups (planuloid-aceloid hypothesis by Graff, Metchnikoff, Hyman, or ), while the other poses that the first bilaterian was a coelomate organism and the main acoelomate phyla (flatworms and gastrotrichs) have lost body cavities secondarily (the Archicoelomata hypothesis and its variations such as the Gastrea by Haeckel or Sedgwick, the Bilaterosgastrea by G\u00f6sta J\u00e4gersten , or the Trochaea by Nielsen).", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "are they considered animals?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "are sponges part of them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what else are they called?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "or?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is the scientific name for the tail?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what about belly?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "do they have a head?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what is the other word for head?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "do all of them have a separate mouth and anus?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what has germ layers?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how many layers?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "please name them", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what is the most recent ancestor called?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "is there anything that doesn't have a front or back?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what do they have?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "give me examples of phyla please.", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "do they have a digestive tract?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "are all the bilateria bilaterally symmetrical?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 379, "span_end": 393, "span_text": "The bilateria ", "input_text": "The bilateria", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 58, "span_text": "The Bilateria or bilaterians, or triploblasts, are animals", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 379, "span_end": 471, "span_text": "The bilateria are a major group of animals, including the majority of phyla but not sponges,", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 29, "span_text": "The Bilateria or bilaterians,", "input_text": "bilaterians,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 30, "span_end": 45, "span_text": "or triploblasts", "input_text": "triploblasts", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 124, "span_end": 144, "span_text": "a tail (\"posterior\")", "input_text": "posterior", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 178, "span_end": 198, "span_text": "a belly (\"ventral\");", "input_text": "ventral", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 90, "span_end": 106, "span_text": "they have a head", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 102, "span_end": 120, "span_text": "head (\"anterior\") ", "input_text": "anterior", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 931, "span_end": 963, "span_text": "with a separate mouth and anus.

Without wishing to convey an impression that the blunt and downright O'Moy was gifted with any undue measure of shrewdness, it must nevertheless be said that he was quick to perceive what fresh thorns the occurrence was likely to throw in a path that was already thorny enough in all conscience, what a semblance of justification it must give to the hostility of the intriguers on the Council of Regency, what a formidable weapon it must place in the hands of Principal Souza and his partisans. In itself this was enough to trouble a man in O'Moy's position. But there was more. Lieutenant Butler happened to be his brother-in-law, own brother to O'Moy's lovely, frivolous wife. Irresponsibility ran strongly in that branch of the Butler family. \n\nFor the sake of the young wife whom he loved with a passionate and fearful jealousy such as is not uncommon in a man of O'Moy's temperament when at his age--he was approaching his forty-sixth birthday--he marries a girl of half his years, the adjutant had pulled his brother-in-law out of many a difficulty; shielded him on many an occasion from the proper consequences of his incurable rashness.

The term is especially used for the confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects\". Thus, while it can simply mean imprisonment, it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement \"after\" having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities. \n\nInterned persons may be held in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as concentration camps. \n\nInternment also refers to a neutral country's practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory during times of war under the Hague Convention of 1907. \n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\" \n\nThe \"American Heritage Dictionary\" defines the term \"concentration camp\" as: \"A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as suspect.\" \n\nThe United States set up concentration camps for Cherokee and other Native Americans in the 1830s. In 1864, the U.S. government forced 8,000 Navajos to walk more than 300 miles at gunpoint from their ancestral homelands in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to an internment camp in Bosque Redondo, a desolate tract on the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico. From 1863 to 1868, the U.S. Military persecuted and imprisoned 9,500 Navajo and 500 Mescalero Apache. Living under armed guards, more than 3,500 Navajo and Mescalero Apache men, women, and children died from starvation and disease. Adolf Hitler admired the U.S. actions toward Native Americans, and in a 1928 speech he praised Americans for having \"gunned down the millions of Redskins to a few hundred thousand, and now keep the modest remnant under observation in a cage.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is internment?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is the term especially used for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does article 9 of The universal Declaration of human RIsghts state?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Regarding neutral countries what does interment also refer to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where may interned persons be held?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How does the american heritage Dictionary define the term concentration camp?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Does it tend to be used to refer to preventitve confinemet raterh than confinement after having been convicted of some crime?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is use of these term subject to debate and political sensitivities?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Whih countries set up concintration camps in the 1830's?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did the U.S. Military persecute anyone from 1863 to 1868?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 17, "span_end": 56, "span_text": " imprisonment or confinement of people,", "input_text": "imprisonment or confinement of people,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 202, "span_text": "confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects\".", "input_text": "confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 903, "span_end": 971, "span_text": "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\" ", "input_text": "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 669, "span_end": 746, "span_text": "practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory", "input_text": "practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 462, "span_end": 516, "span_text": "in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps.", "input_text": "in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1051, "span_end": 1147, "span_text": "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions", "input_text": "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 248, "span_end": 361, "span_text": "it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement \"after\" having been convicted of some crime.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 362, "span_end": 431, "span_text": "Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.

RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE \n\nBlack Star and Night, answering to spur, swept swiftly westward along the white, slow-rising, sage-bordered trail.

From the summit of the first low-swelling ridge he looked back. Lassiter waved his hand; Jane waved her scarf. Venters replied by standing in his stirrups and holding high his sombrero. Then the dip of the ridge hid them. From the height of the next he turned once more. Lassiter, Jane, and the burros had disappeared. They had gone down into the Pass.

But it's all the same to us.\" \n\nThe black dot grew to a dark patch moving under low dust clouds. It grew all the time, though very slowly. There were long periods when it was in plain sight, and intervals when it dropped behind the sage. The blacks trotted for half an hour, for another half-hour, and still the moving patch appeared to stay on the horizon line. Gradually, however, as time passed, it began to enlarge, to creep down the slope, to encroach upon the intervening distance.

It couldn't be. \n\nAnd yet it was. The roar of the wheels told him that it was. The very feel of the luxurious seat in which he was sitting told him that it was. And to clinch the fact and at the same time make it harder to believe there were his three companions, Upton, his patrol leader, Harrison and Pat Malone, whom he had secretly made his hero. Yes, it was all true, and yet he couldn't get rid of the idea that sooner or later he would wake up and find it all a beautiful dream. \n\nThe fact is, this trip was in the nature of a Christmas present. From their first meeting Pat had taken a great fancy to the street gamin. He recognized a kindred spirit. Instinctively he realized that the difference between Sparrer and himself at the same age was mainly one of environment. The youngster's sturdy independence and self-reliance, his quick wit, even his impudence, struck responsive chords in the young woodsman.

Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarian people in neighbouring countries (especially in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Croatia), and by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide. Like Finnish and Estonian, it belongs to the Uralic language family, its closest relatives being Mansi and Khanty. It is the most widely-spoken of the several European languages not part of the Indo-European family. \n\nThe Hungarian name for the language is \"magyar nyelv\" (). The word is used as an English and Hungarian word to refer to Hungarian people as an ethnic group. \n\nHungarian is a member of the Uralic language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an Ugric branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the Mansi and Khanty languages of western Siberia (Khanty\u2013Mansia region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group. When the Samoyed languages were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What language family does Hungarian come from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was that established?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And when did they establish the family?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was this controversial?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did that go on a while?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How long?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did some people want it classed as?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where is it the official language?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it spoken elsewhere?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Are some of these people close to Hungary?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What are some of those?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Are there more?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What are they?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What other groups speak it?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Where are they/", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What doe Hungarians call their language?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does English use that for?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What are the closest languages to it?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How many official languages does the EU have?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 367, "span_end": 373, "span_text": "Uralic", "input_text": "Uralic", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 835, "span_end": 845, "span_text": " the 1670s", "input_text": "the 1670s", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 913, "span_end": 918, "span_text": " 1717", "input_text": "1717", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 924, "span_end": 1117, "span_text": "the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1069, "span_end": 1117, "span_text": " throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1069, "span_end": 1117, "span_text": " throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries", "input_text": "throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 991, "span_end": 999, "span_text": " Turkic ", "input_text": "Turkic", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 54, "span_end": 62, "span_text": " Hungary", "input_text": "Hungary", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 123, "span_end": 218, "span_text": "Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarian people in neighbouring countries ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 172, "span_end": 217, "span_text": "of Hungarian people in neighbouring countries", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 195, "span_end": 217, "span_text": "neighbouring countries", "input_text": "neighbouring countries", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 233, "span_end": 250, "span_text": "Romania, Slovakia", "input_text": "Romania, Slovakia", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 232, "span_end": 270, "span_text": " Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Croatia", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 251, "span_end": 270, "span_text": " Serbia and Croatia", "input_text": "Serbia and Croatia", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 280, "span_end": 310, "span_text": "Hungarian diaspora communities", "input_text": "Hungarian diaspora communities", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 310, "span_end": 320, "span_text": " worldwide", "input_text": "worldwide", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 12, "span_end": 25, "span_text": "magyar nyelv\"", "input_text": "magyar nyelv\"", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 647, "span_end": 695, "span_text": " to refer to Hungarian people as an ethnic group", "input_text": "to refer to Hungarian people as an ethnic group", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 419, "span_end": 435, "span_text": "Mansi and Khanty", "input_text": "Mansi and Khanty", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 77, "span_end": 80, "span_text": " 24", "input_text": "24", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Hungarian_language.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3x73llyyq1eb1i05xy326u0cexshny", "filename": "mc160.train.24", "story": "Chocolate was a box turtle.

The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, by using glass lenses.

When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.\"So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now. For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew. \"Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,\" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day. \"You're right, Rachel!\" said Marilla in surprise. \"And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.\" \"Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,\" said Marilla, smiling. \"And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.\" \"Well, thank you, Rachel,\" replied Marilla, pleased. That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, surprised. \"You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.\" \"It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,\" said Marilla. \"I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.\" \"When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.\" \"I'll still miss her,\" said Marilla sadly.\" In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations. \"Oh, I do hope that I've done well,\" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. \"The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!\" Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her. Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, \"Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!\" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak. \"Well, now, I knew it,\" said Matthew with a warm smile. \"You've done well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.

Supporters of Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann will have to be content with yard signs or donations as ways of cheering on their favorite would-be nominee. \n\nThat's because their campaigns failed to gain the requisite 10,000 signatures. It is, to be sure, a self-inflicted wound, a measure of some organizational chaos. But it is also a function of illogically restrictive local laws. They not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the Oval Office. \n\nThe United States is the only nation in the world, save Switzerland, that does not have uniform federal ballot access laws, according to Ballot Access News, a website run by Richard Winger that is dedicated to the issue. This may reflect the country's closely held federalism, but it can create chaos in a presidential year. In many cases, the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates. \n\nTake, for example, my home state of New York. It votes reliably Democratic in presidential years, at least since Ronald Reagan thrashed Walter Mondale in 1984. But the state's primary delegates can still be a prize in a protracted Republican nomination fight. In 1999, John McCain had to sue to even have his name appear on the ballot alongside George W. Bush because the Republican state party chair and his committee essentially decided that Bush would be their nominee without the inconvenience of putting it to a vote. Local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end-run around democracy. Each presidential cycle, the corrupt kabuki continues.

Muddocks and Cramble could not send her forth equipped as she ought to be equipped for such a husband in so short a time. \"Perhaps they do it quicker in London,\" she said to Everett with a soft regret, remembering the metropolitan glories of her sister's wedding. And then Arthur Fletcher could be present during the Whitsuntide holidays; and the presence of Arthur Fletcher was essential. And it was not only his presence at the altar that was needed;--Parliament was not so exacting but that he might have given that;--but it was considered by the united families to be highly desirable that he should on this occasion remain some days in the country. Emily had promised to attend the wedding, and would of course be at Wharton for at least a week. As soon as Everett had succeeded in wresting a promise from his sister, the tidings were conveyed to Fletcher. It was a great step gained. When in London she was her own mistress; but surrounded as she would be down in Herefordshire by Fletchers and Whartons, she must be stubborn indeed if she should still refuse to be taken back into the flock, and be made once more happy by marrying the man whom she confessed that she loved with her whole heart. The letter to Arthur Fletcher containing the news was from his brother John, and was written in a very business-like fashion. \"We have put off Mary's marriage a few days, so that you and she should be down here together. If you mean to go on with it, now is your time.\" Arthur, in answer to this, merely said he would spend the Whitsuntide holidays at Longbarns.

Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people, making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers, behind only the Indo-European languages, the Sino-Tibetan languages, the Niger-Congo languages, and the Afroasiatic languages. It is on par with Indo-European, Niger\u2013Congo, and Afroasiatic as one of the best-established language families. Major Austronesian languages with the highest number of speakers are Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, and Filipino (Tagalog). The family contains 1,257 languages, which is the second most of any language family. \n\nSimilarities between the languages spoken in the Malay Archipelago and the Pacific Ocean were first observed in 1706 by the Dutch scholar Adriaan Reland. In the 19th century, researchers (e.g. Wilhelm von Humboldt, Herman van der Tuuk) started to apply the comparative method to the Austronesian languages, but the first comprehensive and extensive study on the phonological history of the Austronesian language family including a reconstruction of Proto-Austronesian lexicon was made by the German linguist Otto Dempwolff. The term Austronesian itself was coined by Wilhelm Schmidt (German \"austronesisch\") which comes from Latin \"auster\" \"south wind\" plus Greek \"n\u00easos\" \"island\". The family is aptly named, as the vast majority of Austronesian languages are spoken on islands: only a few languages, such as Malay and the Chamic languages, are indigenous to mainland Asia. Many Austronesian languages have very few speakers, but the major Austronesian languages are spoken by tens of millions of people and one Austronesian language, Malay (including Indonesian and Malaysian), is spoken by 250 million people, making it the 8th most spoken language in the world.

The Recovery College, set up by St Mungo's charity, is providing courses designed to improve technical skills and life skills. \n\nAccording to Andy Williams, who helps to organize the college, the most popular courses have proved to be about raising self-confidence and developing self-pride. \n\nSteve, now in his 50s, told a reporter how much of a difference it makes to \"have a bit of confidence\". He had difficulty learning to read and had to leave school when he was 12. Because Steve's problem was not recognized at the time, he was \"seen to be unable to read or write\", and suffered with depression and alcohol addiction.

Marlborough moved his army on a parallel line to Anderleet. No sooner had he arrived there, than he found that Vendome was still moving towards his right--a proof that Louvain was really the object of the attack. Again the allied troops were set in motion, and all night, through torrents of rain, they tramped wearily along, until at daybreak they were in position at Parc, covering the fortress of Louvain. Vendome, finding himself anticipated, fell back to Braine le Leude without firing a shot. \n\nBut though Marlborough had so far foiled the enemy, it was clear that he was not in a condition to take the offensive before the arrival of Prince Eugene, who would, he trusted, be able to come to his assistance; and for weeks the armies watched each other without movement. \n\nOn the 4th of July, Vendome suddenly marched from Braine le Leude, intending to capture the fortress of Oudenarde. Small bodies of troops were sent off at the same time to Ghent and Bruges, whose inhabitants rose and admitted the French. Marlborough, seeing the danger which threatened the very important fortress of Oudenarde, sent orders to Lord Chandos who commanded at Ath, to collect all the small garrisons in the neighbourhood, and to throw himself into Oudenarde. This was done before Vendome could reach the place, which was thus secured against a coup de main. Vendome invested the fortress, brought up his siege train from Tournay, and moved towards Lessines with his main army, to cover the siege.

But his success didn't make any difference to his life. \n\nThat year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around US$250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first set foot in the city. His life was as simple as before. \n\nThanks to his natural performance in \"Blind Shaft,\" he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film \"A World Without Thieves\" in 2004, which made him famous \n\nimmediately. People called him \"Shagen,\" the name of his character in the movie. \n\nWang's latest work, \"Soldiers' Sortie\" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland .

Choosing to step down from a top job can be an extraordinary decision, whether the person is a pontiff or a politician. But George Pataki, former governor of New York, says making the switch from public figure to John Q. Public wasn't difficult for him. \n\n\"I made up my mind that I was never going to let my public title become my personal identity,\" he says. He embraced what he calls a sense of normalcy after he left office, going to movies and basketball games. \n\nA year or two after he left office, Pataki went to Madison Square Garden with a group of friends to see the Knicks play. And he wanted to stand in line to get himself a hot dog -- something elected officials tend not to do. \n\n\"I loved it,\" he says.

It was an old set, and it did things like that. It wasn't clear enough, but at last Keith Connolly's smiling face appeared on the screen. \"What I really like about playing for Lowgate,\" he said, \"is the fans. They're the best. They always support us. It's wonderful running on to the playground to all that cheering and chanting.\" Danny wished he could be in that crowd at the Lowgate ground, but the price of a single ticket was far above anything he could afford. There was no chance of the whole family going, or even just Danny and his little brother. \"You won again on Saturday,\" said the reporter. \"Did the team go out to celebrate?\" \"We went for a meal together,\" said Keith Connolly, \"but I have to be careful about what I eat, because I want to stay fit. I love doughnuts* very much ...\" Then the sound went fuzzy, and Danny jumped up and _ the top of the set heavily to make it come on again. He hadn't missed much.

For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \"one of the truly great pianists,\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar.

Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one.

Over one million people visited the building during its first 50 days in existence. \n\nFollowing the East Wing project Pei's fame has continued to grow widely. In 1983, French President commissioned Pei to help make the Louvre more modern. Ten years later, the completion of Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre created a new historic landmark for Paris. Pei described it as, \"the greatest challenge and greatest accomplishment of my career.\" At Fragrant Hill, a 300-room hotel in the Chinese capital, Pei has attempted to bring to his native China his often-quoted \"third way of making buildings.\" Avoiding both a complete copying of traditional Chinese motifs as well as the modernism of the West, Pei has managed, at Fragrant Hill, to make one of his most eloquent statements. \n\nPei has designed nearly 50 projects in the United States and abroad. About half of these projects have won major awards. Pei has been awarded the highest honors from nations over the world.

It is time to end this Cold War anachronism, kiss and make up. \n\nAnger over Beyonc\u00e9's supposed breach of the U.S. embargo rules restricting American citizens' travel to Cuba is symbolic of a deeper fear among right-wingers.

Bush has been replaced by a Democrat. As Barack Obama enters his second and final term, immune to electoral imperatives, conservatives worry he may use his freedom of action to effect an historic rapprochement with Cuba. American liberals certainly believe he should do so. \n\nThe second change is in Cuba itself, where the government, now led by Fidel Castro's brother, Raoul, has embarked on a cautious program of reform. The government -- dubbed the world's longest-running dictatorship by the American right -- has even set a date for its own dissolution. \n\nDoing what \"dictators\" rarely do, Raoul Castro announced in February that in 2018, he would hand over power and that any successor would be subject to term limits.

Police declined to file charges. \n\nThe singer has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic in January. \n\nWinehouse won five Grammy awards this year -- three for \"Rehab\" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. \n\nWinehouse's Grammy winning album, \"Back to Black,\" is still a big seller, recently charting at No. 12 in the UK more than 19 months after its release. Madame Toussaud's London wax museum recently unveiled a wax statue of Winehouse alongside Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and other musicians in the museum's \"Music Zone\" exhibit.

It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[c] Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50\u00d7109 km). Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is \u2646, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. \n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.

Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths.

He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. \"And that is their so-called \"Syncretism\" [Union of Cretans]\". \n\nErasmus probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word in his \"Adagia\" (\"Adages\"), published in the winter of 1517\u20131518, to designate the coherence of dissenters in spite of their differences in theological opinions. In a letter to Melanchthon of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage \"Concord is a mighty rampart\". \n\nOvert syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the \"other\" cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized \"syncresis\" nevertheless.

A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims. \n\nPresent-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, the Mali Empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France and stretched to the west coast of Africa. In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal's withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what country is the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "when was the new constitution written?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "which countries joined in 1959", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "is Mali a 1 party state?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how many natural resources of Mali are named?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what religion are most people?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what percent are non-denominational muslim?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what is the official name of Mali?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "where is Mali located?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what is the population?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "does anyone live in poverty?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "is there fishing there?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 67, "span_text": "Mali (i/\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0li/; French: [ma\u02c8li]), officially the Republic of Mali ", "input_text": "Republic of Mali", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1750, "span_end": 1806, "span_text": "a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution ", "input_text": "1991", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1432, "span_end": 1510, "span_text": "French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with Senegal in 1959", "input_text": "French Sudan and Senegal", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1787, "span_end": 1870, "span_text": "a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 606, "span_end": 730, "span_text": "Mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent, and salt", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 823, "span_end": 890, "span_text": " A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims.", "input_text": "Non-denominational Muslims.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 824, "span_end": 891, "span_text": "A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims.

Well,Mary Anderson came up with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City.The day was cold and stormy,but Anderson still wanted to see the sights,so she jumped aboard a streetcar.Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield,she found herself wondering why there couldn't be a built--in device for cleaning the window.Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham,Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions.One of her ideas,a lever on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside,became the first windshield wiper. \n\nToday we benefit from countless inventions and innovations.It's hard to imagine driving without Garrett A.Morgan's traffic light.It's equally impossible to picture a world

mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values \"true\" and \"false\", usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction \"and\" denoted as \u2227, the disjunction \"or\" denoted as \u2228, and the negation \"not\" denoted as \u00ac. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations. \n\nBoolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\" (1847), and set forth more fully in his \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought\" (1854). According to Huntington, the term \"Boolean algebra\" was first suggested by Sheffer in 1913. \n\nBoolean algebra has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics, and is provided for in all modern programming languages. It is also used in set theory and statistics. \n\nBoole's algebra predated the modern developments in abstract algebra and mathematical logic; it is however seen as connected to the origins of both fields. In an abstract setting, Boolean algebra was perfected in the late 19th century by Jevons, Schr\u00f6der, Huntington, and others until it reached the modern conception of an (abstract) mathematical structure. For example, the empirical observation that one can manipulate expressions in the algebra of sets by translating them into expressions in Boole's algebra is explained in modern terms by saying that the algebra of sets is \"a\" Boolean algebra (note the indefinite article). In fact, M. H. Stone proved in 1936 that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was Boolean algebra named?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "By whom?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How are variables named?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Which one is false?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And true?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who started this concept?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "And his book was?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When was it published?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he write another one?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And it's title?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How is it used in modern times?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What does it predate?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "In what?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who made it perfect?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "In what era?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who had a theory in 1936?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was it?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Was it proven?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 885, "span_end": 889, "span_text": "1913", "input_text": "1913", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 874, "span_end": 881, "span_text": "Sheffer", "input_text": "Sheffer", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 137, "span_end": 157, "span_text": " \"true\" and \"false\",", "input_text": "\"true\" and \"false\",", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 179, "span_end": 181, "span_text": " 0", "input_text": "0", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 174, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "1", "input_text": "One", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 641, "span_end": 653, "span_text": "George Boole", "input_text": "George Boole", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 673, "span_end": 707, "span_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic", "input_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 710, "span_end": 714, "span_text": "1847", "input_text": "1847", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 725, "span_end": 790, "span_text": "forth more fully in his \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought\"", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 792, "span_end": 797, "span_text": "1854)", "input_text": "1854", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 750, "span_end": 789, "span_text": "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought", "input_text": "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 937, "span_end": 972, "span_text": "development of digital electronics,", "input_text": "development of digital electronics,", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 977, "span_end": 1075, "span_text": "is provided for in all modern programming languages.

In a taped conversation between the captain and the port authority in Livorno, the port authority ordered Schettino to \"get back on board\" while passengers were still being rescued from the other side of the ship. \n\nSchettino, who admits that he was in command when the ship veered off course and hit the rocks, also blames a malfunction of the ship's watertight doors for making the situation worse.

It is the ratio of runs conceded per wickets taken, meaning that the lower the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing. The bowling average is commonly used alongside the economy rate and the strike rate to judge the overall performance of a bowler. Where a bowler has taken only a small number of wickets, their average can be artificially low, and an increase in wickets taken can result in large changes in their bowling average. Due to this, qualification caveats are generally applied to determine career records for bowling averages. After applying these criteria, George Lohmann holds the record for the lowest average in Test cricket, having claimed 112 wickets at an average of 10.75. \n\nA cricketer's bowling average is calculated by dividing the numbers of runs they have conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. The number of runs conceded by a bowler is determined as the total number of runs that the opposing side have scored while the bowler was bowling, excluding any byes, leg byes, or penalty runs. The bowler receives credit for any wickets taken during their bowling that are either bowled, caught, hit wicket, leg before wicket or stumped.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What concept is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Specfically what statistic?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is it a ratio?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What's the first thing being compared in the ratio?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And the second?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is it good to have a high average?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many other stats are there to measure how good a bowler is?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is one of them?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And the other?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many types of runs are not included in the average?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are leg byes one of them?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "And the others?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who has the record for the smallest average?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "In which type of cricket?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many wickets did he get?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "And his average?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Can any player hold the record?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many types of wickets are there?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Name one of them.", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What's another?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 75, "span_end": 161, "span_text": "s in the sport of cricket.

in a Manhattan subway, a law enforcement official told CNN Thursday. \n\nPolice believe Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was out on parole when he stabbed two young children inside an elevator -- killing one of them. \n\nSt. Hubert was arrested by detectives around 8 p.m. Wednesday. \n\nHe was arrested around the same time that Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified St. Hubert by name for the first time as the suspect in the attack. \n\nDetectives were obtaining evidence Thursday that could link him to a fatal stabbing on the subway in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, the official said. \n\nInvestigators were executing search warrants to see if he is linked to additional stabbings since his release from prison on May 23, a law enforcement official said. \n\nLaw enforcement has been involved with St. Hubert plenty in the past, including nine arrests, though police did not specify all the outcomes. \n\nThe most recent instance was May 23, when, Boyce said. St. Hubert was released on parole in connection to a domestic assault case. \n\nNine days later, police believe he encountered 6-year-old Prince Joshua \"PJ\" Avitto and 7-year-old Mikayla Capers inside an elevator at a public housing complex in Brooklyn. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the two children were \"on their way to get ice cream\" at the time. \n\nFor reasons authorities haven't yet explained, the two children were stabbed -- both in the torso. PJ Avitto was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information.to predict what the world will be like in the future. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he's most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the future. Many public transportation supporters dislike big cities because they spend hours driving from one side of the city to the other. And there aren't enough buses and. subways. However, Golden sees a trend toward fewer cars' in the future. He explains, \"Cities have a cost of car ownership, which is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city in services, in having to repair roads and other things. \"Cars also take up a lot of space. Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is wasteful. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. What is the solution?\"I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,\" says Golden. \"Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route to meet people's requests.\" How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years. Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. \"But it's coming,\" he says. \"The trend of the empowered city will be here soon. \" The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors to understand the world around them. \"If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to cut down on traffic jams,\"he says. Rush hour in big cities would be much less painful. One challenge is that it is hard to cheaply produce batteries that are strong enough for these cars. But Golden argues we could, also make cars out of strong plastic composites . The cars would then be much lighter and much cheaper to make. Golden remains positive about the future. \"There are so many exciting developments ,\"he says. \"In thirty years we will live a different world. \"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the last name of this person??", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "And the first?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What are they?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does he examine?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does he especially look forward to?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What do people spend too much time doing in big areas?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is there a shortage of anything there?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is one thing?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What does he think will happen?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What is a disadvantage of automobiles?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does it waste?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What might mayors do instead?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What will people start to use?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is something they could do with their phones?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What is the trend called he thinks will happen?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What else is he looking forward to?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is a problem with them?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "And a solution?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 28, "span_text": "Garry Golden is a futurist.

The day was that on which the Secretary of State was closeted with the barrister, and on the evening of which he at length determined that Caldigate should be allowed to go free. There had, therefore, been no pardon granted,--as yet. But in the letter the writer stated that such pardon would, almost certainly, be awarded. \n\nIt was from William Bolton, in London, to his brother the attorney, and was written with the view of proving to all the Boltons at Cambridge, that it was their duty to acknowledge Hester as the undoubted wife of John Caldigate; and recommended also that, for Hester's sake, they should receive him as her husband. The letter had been written with very great care, and had been powerful enough to persuade Robert Bolton of the truth of the first proposition. \n\nIt was very long, and as it repeated all the details of the evidence for and against the verdict, it shall not be repeated here at its full length.

Faulkner wrote about the southern states of the United States of America where he grew up, and where his family had an important part to play in the history of that region. His work became a touchstone for insights into the troubled issues of southern American identity, race relations, and the family interrelationships of the old time southern gentry . \n\nFaulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi on September 25, 1897. Despite his interest in writing, he left Oxford High School, Mississippi, without graduating. After World War I, he entered the University of Mississippi as a special student, a right to study which was granted to retired soldiers, although Faulkner had only finished training with the Air Force in Canada, and not entered combat . \n\nFaulkner began to write poems, a verse play, short stories and finished his first novel Sartoris in 1928. His fiction was centered for 14 of the 19 novels published during his lifetime in a fictional region called Yoknapatawpha County. The name is said to come from the Indian Chickasaw word meaning split land. \n\nIn December 1950, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. When he accepted it in Stockholm, his speech emphasized that he wished to continue writing, but in a positive way that affirmed the power of humanity to prevail over adverse circumstances. As he said in his speech, he still felt that, despite the threat of nuclear war then hanging over the world, the central concern of the writer should be \"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself\". He wanted the tensions and problems that he had cast the spotlight on in the southern states of America to be resolved by the life-affirming attitudes and action of his characters. Like playwright Tennessee Williams, Faulkner was a major voice who spoke for the troubled heart of the southern states of America. His achievement is all the more remarkable because, as a schoolboy, he was not only a frequent absentee but also reportedly failed to reach pass grades in English class. His collected short stories, novels, poems, and other writings form a legacy( ) of literature which casts profound illumination on the special culture of the South, a culture which developed from a history and social circumstances that were always unique. \n\nFrom the focus on a fictional county, and by remaining true to his view of a close-knit but real society that reflected the greater world around him, Faulkner in the end fashioned a legend of the Deep South that is one of the major achievements of the 20th century literature.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was William Faukner?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did he write about?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And what else?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did he do after World War I?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did he write poems", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "when was his first novel published?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Was it a fiction?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does Yoknpaptawpha County mean?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What happened in December 1950?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where did he accept the award?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Has he ever failed in school?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What about skipping school?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "which classes did he fail in?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 47, "span_end": 81, "span_text": " one of the great modern novelists", "input_text": "one of the great modern novelists", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 117, "span_end": 206, "span_text": "Faulkner wrote about the southern states of the United States of America where he grew up", "input_text": "the southern states of the United States of America", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 337, "span_end": 386, "span_text": "the troubled issues of southern American identity", "input_text": "the troubled issues of southern American identity", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 636, "span_end": 695, "span_text": "After World War I, he entered the University of Mississippi", "input_text": "he entered the University of Mississippi", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 876, "span_end": 906, "span_text": "Faulkner began to write poems,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 935, "span_end": 980, "span_text": "and finished his first novel Sartoris in 1928", "input_text": "1928", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 964, "span_end": 993, "span_text": "Sartoris in 1928.

When he mentioned his career, one man wanted Duckworth's opinion on his struggles with depression; another asked for advice on a family member's mental illness. \n\n\"I was sort of amazed. They were talking openly about their mental disabilities with a stranger in a swimming locker room, \" said Duckworth, \"That wouldn't have happened 15 years ago. \" \n\nNew research shows that these swimmers aren't the only ones opening up. According to a new study, more American adults than ever are reporting being disabled by the symptoms of depression, anxiety or other emotional problems. \n\nThe report, published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health, found that people who said they couldn't perform everyday tasks or engage in social and leisure activities because of a mental illness increased from 2 percent in 1999 to 2.7 percent in 2009. That increase amounts to nearly 2 million more people disabled by mental distress in the past decade, the report said. \n\nAlthough people did not say they felt more mental distressed compared to past years, they reported that their mental health problems had a greater impact on their daily lives. \n\nDr. Ramin Mojtabai, the study's author, said it's unclear whether the findings tell a sad story of greater mental distress in recent times or point to a victory for public education about the importance of acknowledging and evaluating mental illness. \n\n\"It is possible that people are realizing the effects of mental illness more acutely now than before,\" he said. \"People could be becoming more aware. \" \n\nMojtabai said it's also possible that a number of factors could be taking a toll on the population's mental well-being. High unemployment, economic hardships and a growing sense of isolation could be putting greater stress on Americans. \n\nBut Duckworth said there could be a more positive explanation -- like his fellow swimmers, people may be getting more comfortable with talking about their mental distress. \n\n\"I wonder if this tells us that American culture is becoming more open and is giving people the ability to speak about it,\" he said. \"If people have this problem and are willing to acknowledge it, then we're getting closer to dealing with it.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where did Dr. Duckworth work?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 55, "span_end": 68, "span_text": "Massachusetts", "input_text": "Massachusetts", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "high4000.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3nkqq8o39y57ksfc83wyt4d8v6cdu8", "filename": "cnn_438fd7c89c9100e789133e5a2e4256370203f4ce.story", "story": "(CNN) -- Closing arguments were made Friday in the trial of Steven Hayes, the man accused of killing three members of a Connecticut family in a 2007 home invasion. \n\nJurors are expected to begin deliberations as early as midday Monday. \n\nHayes, 47, who has entered a plea of not guilty, is currently on trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters. \n\nThe killings took place in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire in the early hours of July 23, 2007.

And his flight adds colour to the versions of the affair that were afforded the world by Cesare and his father. Andrea Doria, waiting to surrender his trust, had nothing to fear from the duke, no reason to do anything but remain. Andrea Doria, intriguing against the duke's life with the condottieri, finding them seized by the duke, and inferring that all was discovered, had every reason to fly. \n\nThe citadel made surrender on that New Year's morning, when Cesare summoned it to do so, whilst the troops of the Orsini and Vitelli lodged in the castles of the territory, being taken unawares, were speedily disposed of. So, there being nothing more left to do in Sinigaglia, Cesare once more marshalled his men and set out for Citt\u00e0 di Castello--the tyranny of the Vitelli, which he found undefended and of which he took possession in the name of the Church. Thence he rushed on towards Perugia, for he had word that Guidobaldo of Urbino, Fabio Orsini, Annibale and Venanzio Varano, and Vitelli's nephew were assembled there under the wing of Gianpaolo Baglioni, who, with a considerable condotta at his back, was making big talk of resisting the Duke of Romagna and Valentinois. In this, Gianpaolo persevered most bravely until he had news that the duke was as near as Gualdo, when precipitately he fled--leaving his guests to shift for themselves. He had remembered, perhaps, at the last moment how narrow an escape he had had of it at Sinigaglia, and he repaired to Siena to join Pandolfo Petrucci, who had been equally fortunate in that connection.

A certain allowance of splendid hospitality at Castle Corry was at his disposal every year, and Lord Altringham always welcomed him with thorough kindness. But George Hotspur had in some fashion been made to understand that he was not to overstay his time; and he was quite aware that the Earl could be very disagreeable upon occasions. There was a something in the Earl of which George was afraid; and, to tell the truth, he did not dare to go back to Castle Corry. And then, might it not be well for him to make immediate preparation in London for those inquiries respecting his debts and his character which Sir Harry had decided to make? It would be very difficult for him to make any preparation that could lead to a good result; but if no preparation were made, the result would be very bad indeed. It might perhaps be possible to do something with Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. He had no other immediate engagements.

Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970\u00a0km (203,850\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra. \n\nYemen was the home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the fourth century, whereas Judaism and local paganism were already established. Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries, the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962.

If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . \"Everyone should just relax\", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents.\" Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, aged 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework.

Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system (although UCSF was founded in 1864 and predates the establishment of the UC system) and is\u00a0ranked\u00a0as one of the world's leading research universities and the top\u00a0public university\u00a0in the United States. \n\nEstablished in 1868 as the University of California, resulting from the merger of the private College of California and the public Agricultural, Mining and Mechanical Arts College in Oakland, Berkeley offers approximately 350 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of disciplines. The Dwinelle Bill of March 5, 1868 (California Assembly Bill No. 583) stated that the \"University shall have for its design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete education in all departments of science, literature and art, industrial and profession[al] pursuits, and general education, and also special courses of instruction in preparation for the professions\".

We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. \n\nWe piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no. I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. \n\nWhen we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. \n\nIt felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home. \n\nWhen I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle.

The movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond because of vigorous missionary work, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. \n\nWesley's theology focused on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian. Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include an assurance of salvation, imparted righteousness, the possibility of perfection in love, the works of piety, and the primacy of Scripture. Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all; in theology, this view is known as Arminianism. This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people. However, Whitefield and several others were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinistic position. Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the works of mercy.

It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa in terms of area. \n\nChad has several regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital N'Djamena is the largest city. \n\nChad's official languages are Arabic and French. Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. The religions of Chad are Islam (at 55%), followed by Christianity (at 40%). \n\nBeginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony.

He was at one time a close friend of C.\u00a0S.\u00a0Lewis\u2014they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. \n\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including \"The Silmarillion\". These, together with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings. \n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or, more precisely, of high fantasy.

Many people ride bicycles for recreation, whereas others use them as a means of transportation. The first bicycle was invented in Germany in 1818. Because it was made of wood, it wasn't very strong nor did it have pedals .Riders moved it by pushing their feet against the ground. \n\nIn 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, invented a much better bicycle. Macmillan's machine had iron-covered wheels to keep them from getting worn down. He also used foot-operated levers, similar to pedals, so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick pace. It didn't look much like the modem bicycle, though, because its back wheel was substantially larger than its front wheel. Although Macmillan's bicycles could be ridden easily, they were never produced in large numbers. \n\nIn 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and his brother Ernest invented a bicycle with an improved pedal mechanism. They called their bicycle a velocipede,but most people called it a \"bone shaker\" because of the effect of the wood and iron frame. Despite the impolite nickname, the velocipede was a hit. After a few years, the Michaux family was making hundreds of the machines annually, mostly for fun-seeking young people. \n\nTen years later, James Starley , an English inventor, made several innovations that revolutionized bicycle design. He made the front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear on the pedals to make the bicycle more efficient,and lightened the wheels by using wire spokes. Although this bicycle was much lighter and less tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy,and ridden mostly for entertainment. \n\nIt wasn't until 1874 that the first truly modern bicycle appeared on the scene. Invented by another Englishman, H. J. Lawson, the safety bicycle would look familiar to today's cyclists. The safety bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it easier to ride. Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the back wheel. By 1893,the safety bicycle had been further improved with air-filled rubber tires, a diamond-shaped frame, and easy braking. With the improvements provided by Lawson;bicycles became extremely popular and useful for transportation. Today, they are built, used, and enjoyed all over the world.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is one of the common vehicle in the world?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was it invented?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who made a better one then?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who was he?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where was he from?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How was his wheels?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How about the levers?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it similar to pedals we have today?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was that bicycle fast enough?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did it resemble anything we have today?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who made next improvements?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where was he from?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What he improved?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Which year was that?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Then who made more improvements?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What he did?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When did the bicycle looked modern day one?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who invented that?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When the air filled tires appeared?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 7, "span_end": 15, "span_text": "bicycles", "input_text": "bicycles", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 221, "span_end": 225, "span_text": "1818", "input_text": "1818", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 217, "span_text": "Germany", "input_text": "Germany", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 371, "span_end": 392, "span_text": "Kirkpatrick Macmillan", "input_text": "Kirkpatrick Macmillan", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 405, "span_end": 415, "span_text": "blacksmith", "input_text": "blacksmith", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 396, "span_end": 404, "span_text": "Scottish", "input_text": "Scottland", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 473, "span_end": 485, "span_text": "iron-covered", "input_text": "iron-covered", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 543, "span_end": 556, "span_text": "foot-operated", "input_text": "foot-operated", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 564, "span_end": 582, "span_text": " similar to pedals", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 620, "span_end": 630, "span_text": "quick pace", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 635, "span_end": 646, "span_text": "didn't look", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 872, "span_end": 886, "span_text": "Pierre Michaux", "input_text": "Pierre Michaux", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 861, "span_end": 871, "span_text": " Frenchman", "input_text": "Frence", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 961, "span_text": "pedal mechanism", "input_text": "pedal mechanism", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 856, "span_end": 860, "span_text": "1861", "input_text": "1861", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1291, "span_end": 1304, "span_text": "James Starley", "input_text": "James Starley", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1381, "span_end": 1387, "span_text": "design", "input_text": "improved design", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1719, "span_end": 1723, "span_text": "1874", "input_text": "1874", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1815, "span_end": 1827, "span_text": "H.

With over 75 million inhabitants, it is the fifth-largest state in India by population. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest. Its total area is 308,252\u00a0km.

Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. By the early 18th century, the region was divided into several small kingdoms which were captured by the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with Nagpur as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region was removed and merged with the then Bombay State.

In Jerusalem the factions tore each other. In Galilee let the Jewish leader Josephus, under whom Caleb was fighting, do what he would, Vespasian and his generals stormed city after city, massacring their inhabitants by thousands and tens of thousands. In the coast towns and elsewhere Syrians and Jews made war. The Jews assaulted Gadara and Gaulonitis, Sebaste and Ascalon, Anthedon and Gaza, putting many to the sword. Then came their own turn, for the Syrians and Greeks rose upon them and slaughtered them without mercy. As yet, however, there had been no blood shed in Tyre, though all knew that it must come. The Essenes, who had been driven from their home by the Dead Sea and taken refuge in Jerusalem, sent messengers to Miriam warning her to flee from Tyre, where a massacre was being planned; warning her also not to come to Jerusalem, which city they believed to be doomed, but to escape, if possible over sea. Nor was this all, for her own people, the Christians, besought her to fly for her life's sake with them to the city of Pella, where they were gathering from Jerusalem and all Jud\u00e6a. To both Miriam answered that what her grandsire did, that she must do. If he fled, she would fly; if he stayed at Tyre, she would stay; if he went to Jerusalem, she would go; for he had been good to her and she had sworn that while he lived she would not desert him. So the Essene messengers went back to Jerusalem, and the Christian elders prayed with her, and having blessed her and consigned her to the care of the Most High and His Son, their Lord, departed to Pella, where, as it was fated, through all those dreadful times not a hair of their heads was touched.

Suicide can be contagious ,\" Zhang said. \n\nThe university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23. \n\nAdvisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. \n\nNotice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. \n\nHowever, the second suicide came seven days later. \n\nBoth students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. \n\nZhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled the truth after the suicides. \n\nAccording to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\" \n\nSome universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors. \n\nAt Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates. \n\nThey also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help. \n\nTo develop such empathy , many universities in China have organized campus events to popularize knowledge about mental health. But these are not that attractive to students. \n\nKe Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it. \n\nRather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression. \n\n\"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\" \n\nEffective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an. Hu delivers a course of lectures on life and death at Guangzhou University. He worries that universities have paid little attention to education for life. \n\n\"Education for life helps students respect and love life so they won't resort to ending their lives when they have difficulties,\" said Hu. \n\nAccording to Hu, the principles can be incorporated into everyday teaching.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the nightmare that is occuring?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "are officials talking?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "how far apart were the deaths?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "were they chatty men?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "did they have any issues?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "do they think counselors can fix the issues alone?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what are some schools doing to help?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "to do what?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what are some things the trained students can do?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what are chinese campuses doing?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "are the students interested?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what is suggested they do instead?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what can education for life do?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does Hu teach?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 75, "span_end": 152, "span_text": "within a week, two students committed suicide by jumping off dorm buildings.

They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. \n\nBraille is named after its creator, Louis Braille, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing. He published his system, which subsequently included musical notation, in 1829. The second revision, published in 1837, was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era. \n\nBraille characters are rectangular blocks called \"cells\" containing tiny bumps called \"raised dots\". The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in English Braille there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1 \u2013 a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 \u2013 an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 \u2013 various non-standardized personal shorthands.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who came up with Braille?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it named for him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was he trying to make night writing better?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did his code represent?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old was he then?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was published in 1937?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What about in 1837", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was this the first form of something?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "During what period?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who is braille meant for", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 424, "span_end": 473, "span_text": "Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille", "input_text": "Louis Braille", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 424, "span_end": 473, "span_text": "Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 543, "span_end": 642, "span_text": "In 1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing.", "input_text": "1824", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 562, "span_end": 606, "span_text": " he developed a code for the French alphabet", "input_text": "the French alphabet", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 546, "span_end": 642, "span_text": "1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing.", "input_text": "15", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 723, "span_end": 761, "span_text": "The second revision, published in 1837", "input_text": "second revision", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 762, "span_end": 828, "span_text": " was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era.", "input_text": "binary form of writing", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 763, "span_end": 829, "span_text": "was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era.

Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially beliefs and values\u2014shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. \n\nThe earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece.

While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of the woman herself, who really wondered what was wrong with her and registered for _ training.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Steve's wife?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is she very talkative?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Have she and Steve been married a long time?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What conversation technique are Betty and Sara not in sync with?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Does Betty think that Sara talks too much?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is one result if people's conversation techniques are different?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's another?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What's a possible reason that Betty is used to long pauses?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who is American?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do Americans generally have longer or shorter pauses than people from Latin America?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Do any countries have generally longer pauses than the UK?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is one example?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is a possible outcome of having different conversational styles?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is it possible some people see pausing and pacing as a barometer on intellect?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Would someone from the UK think an American as pushy because of how they talk?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Is the way we pace our conversations something we actively think about while we are talking?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "The woman from the southwest moved to what area?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Was she seen as introverted at home?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was she asked to do after her evaluation?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 57, "span_end": 84, "span_text": "Steve's new wife, but Betty", "input_text": "Betty", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 78, "span_end": 121, "span_text": " Betty never seemed to have anything to say", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 57, "span_end": 74, "span_text": "Steve's new wife,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 55, "span_text": "Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old frien", "input_text": "Pacing and Pausing", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 189, "span_end": 256, "span_text": "Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 420, "span_end": 484, "span_text": "habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished ", "input_text": "start to talk before the other person is finished", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 483, "span_end": 527, "span_text": " or fail to take your turn when I'm finished", "input_text": "fail to talk when the other person is finished", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 607, "span_end": 679, "span_text": " Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British,", "input_text": "Betty is British,", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 741, "span_text": "Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American", "input_text": "Sara", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 714, "span_end": 741, "span_text": "shorter pauses, is American", "input_text": "shorter", "turn_id": 10, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 902, "span_end": 984, "span_text": "And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 959, "span_end": 984, "span_text": " Latin America or Israel.", "input_text": "Latin America", "turn_id": 12, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1183, "span_end": 1257, "span_text": "These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping ", "input_text": "stereotyping", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1733, "span_end": 1808, "span_text": "she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 575, "span_end": 781, "span_text": " It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American.

He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. \n\n\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\" he wrote in his blog post. \n\nDavid's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. \n\n\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. \n\nAt MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering. Principal Jeff McClellan found David to be a great student and all-around person, but with a serious living situation, so he stepped in to help. After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. \n\nWhen it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. \n\nDavid's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

Tom looked at the fence, which was long and high, feeling all enthusiasm leaving him. He dipped his brush into the whitewash before moving it along the top board of the fence. He knew other boys would arrive soon with all minds of interesting plans for this day. As walking past him, they would tease him for having to work on a beautiful Saturday--which burnt him like fire. \n\nHe, putting his hands into his pockets and taking out all he owned with the expectation of letting someone paint, found nothing that could buy half an hour of freedom. At this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea occurred to him, pouring a great bright light into his mind. He took up his brush and continued to work pleasantly with calm and quietness. \n\nPresently, Ben Rogers came in sight--munching an apple and making joyful noises like the sound of a riverboat as he walked along. Tom went on whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat. \"Hello!\" Ben said, \"I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\" \n\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush gently along the fence and surveyed the result. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for Ben's apple while he kept painting the fence. \n\nBen said, \"That's a lot of work, isn't it?\" \n\nTom turned suddenly saying \"Here you are! Ben! I didn't notice you.\" \n\n\"I'm going swimming,\" Ben said. \"Don't you wish you could go? Or would you rather work?\" Tom said, \"Work? What do you mean 'work'?\" \n\n\"Isn't that work?\" Tom continued painting and answered carelessly, \"Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is it suits Tom Sawyer.\" \n\n\"Do you mean that you enjoy it?\" \n\n\"I don't see why I oughtn't to enjoy it.\" \n\n\"Does a boy have a chance to paint a fence frequently\" said Tom. \n\nBen stopped munching his apple. \n\nTom moved his brush back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a little paint here and there. Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. After a short time, he said, \"Tom, let me whitewash a little.\" \n\nTom seemed to be thinking for a moment before he said, \"No, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. If it was the back fence, maybe you could do it. But this fence beside the street is where everybody can see it. It has to be done right.\" \n\n\"Oh, come on, let me try. I'll be careful. Listen, Tom. I'll give you part of my apple if you let me paint.\" \"No, Ben, I'm afraid--\" \"I'll give you all the apple!\" \n\nTom handed the brush to Ben with unwillingness on his face but _ in his heart. While the riverboat worked and sweated in the hot sun, Tom, an artist sat in the shade close by, munching his apple, and planning how he could trick more of the boys. \n\nBefore long there were enough boys each of whom came along the street; stopped to laugh but soon begged to be allowed to paint.

There are some people who can calculate the day of the week for any given date in 40,000 years, but who cannot add two plus two. Others can perform complex classical piano pieces after hearing them once, but they cannot read or write. \n\nDr. J. Langdon Down first described this condition in 1887. He called these people idiot savants. An idiot savant is a person who has significant mental injury, such as in autism or retardation. At the same time, the person also exhibits some extraordinary skills, which are unusual for most people. The skills of the savant may vary from being exceptionally gifted in music or in mathematics, or having a photographic memory. \n\nOne of the first descriptions of a human who could calculate quickly was written in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, an American doctor. His patient, Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724. It took Thomas only 90 seconds to work out that a man who has lived 70 years, 17 days, and 12 hours has lived 2,210,500,800 seconds. Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write. \n\nAnother idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s. Blind Tom had a vocabulary of only 100 words, but he played 5,000 musical pieces beautifully. \n\nIn the excellent movie Rain Man, made in 1988 and available on video cassette, Dustin Hoffman plays an idiot savant who amazes his brother played by Tom Cruise, with his ability to perform complex calculations very rapidly. \n\nToday we more clearly recognize that the idiot savant is special because of brain impairment. Yet not all brain injury leads to savant skills. Some studies have shown that people who have purposeful interruption of the left side of the brain can develop idiot savant skills. However few people wish to participate in such experiments. There are many excellent reasons for not undergoing unnecessary experimentation on one's brain. The term idiot savant is outdated and inappropriate. Virtually all savants have a high degree of intelligence and are thus not idiots.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are idiot savants?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What type of skills?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "And?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who wrote about a human that could calculate fast?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was his profession?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was he from?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What year did he write about this person?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was his patient's name?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was he a free man?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was he literate?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who became famous as a pianist?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many words did he know?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How many music pieces could he play?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What actor played Rain Man?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was his amazing skill?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Does all brain injury leads to savant skills?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Do many people wish to participate in experiments to determine idiot savant?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Does the author like the term idiot savant?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 399, "span_end": 441, "span_text": "a person who has significant mental injury", "input_text": "a person who has significant mental injury but has extraordinary skills", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 641, "span_end": 656, "span_text": "gifted in music", "input_text": "gifted in music", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 663, "span_end": 674, "span_text": "mathematics", "input_text": "mathematics", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 679, "span_end": 707, "span_text": "having a photographic memory", "input_text": "having a photographic memory", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 803, "span_end": 820, "span_text": "Dr. Benjamin Rush", "input_text": "Dr. Benjamin Rush", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 834, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "doctor", "input_text": "doctor", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 807, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "Benjamin Rush, an American doctor", "input_text": "America", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 792, "span_end": 820, "span_text": "in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush", "input_text": "1789", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 842, "span_end": 868, "span_text": "His patient, Thomas Fuller", "input_text": "Thomas Fuller", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 855, "span_end": 912, "span_text": "Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1047, "span_end": 1123, "span_text": "Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1127, "span_end": 1204, "span_text": "Another idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s.

Mitch McConnell -- talking to a donor summit arranged by the Koch brothers, the Democrats' 2014 bogeymen. \n\nDemocrats pushed \"The Nation\" story around online with frenetic glee. \n\nMcConnell's Democratic challenger for his Kentucky seat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, couldn't wait to whack him on it, telling CNN in an exclusive interview that \"Mitch McConnell got caught in his 47% Mitt Romney moment.\" \n\n\"I think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting Kentuckians,\" Grimes told CNN. \n\nThe problem with the Democrats' argument is that Romney's 47% moment was only a moment because he was saying to donors in private something he would never have dared to utter in public: \n\n\"Forty-seven percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement,\" Romney said behind closed doors about President Obama's supporters in 2012. \n\nBut unlike Romney, what McConnell said to the Koch brothers are things he has said in public, and more importantly, his comments mirror positions he has publicly backed with actual Senate votes: opposition to Democrats' plans to increase the minimum wage, extend unemployment insurance and make student loans more affordable through the tax system.

There was already a good sprinkling of early diners there, and Louis was busy as usual. Directly he saw me, however, he came forward with his usual suave bow. \n\n\"The table in the left-hand corner,\" he said, \"is engaged for monsieur. I have also taken the liberty of commanding a little dinner.\" \n\n\"But I am not dining here, Louis!\" I protested. \n\nLouis' expression was one of honest surprise. \n\n\"Monsieur is serious?\" he inquired. \"It is only a short time ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and she told me that she was dining with you here.\" \n\n\"I am dining with Miss Delora,\" I answered, \"but I certainly did not understand that it was to be here.\" \n\nLouis smiled. \n\n\"Perhaps,\" he remarked, \"mademoiselle had, for the moment, the idea of going away for dinner. If so, believe me, she has changed her mind. Monsieur will see when he calls for her.\" \n\nI passed on thoughtfully. There was something about this which I scarcely understood. It seemed almost as though Louis had but to direct, and every one obeyed. Was I, too, becoming one of his myrmidons? Was I, too, to dine at his cafe because he had spoken the word? \n\nI made my way to number 157 precisely at half-past seven. Felicia was waiting for me, and for a moment I forgot to ask any questions,--forgot everything except the pleasure of looking at her.

He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down. \n\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire. \n\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea \n\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash. \n\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped. \n\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\" \n\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working. \n\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\" \n\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.\" \n\n\"Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.\" \n\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\" \n\n\"Why, isn't that work?\" \n\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly. \n\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\" \n\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\" \n\nThe brush continued to move. \n\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\" \n\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said, \n\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\" \n\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind. \n\n\"No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\" \n\n\"No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little.\" \"Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... \" \n\n\"Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.\" \n\n\"Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...\" \n\n\"I'll give you all of it.\" \n\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat --and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures. \n\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends. \n\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did Ben want Tom to do with him?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Could he go?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was his chore?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who asked him to do it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was he paid to do the tast?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what day was this?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he have money to burn in his pockets?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who was the first victim of his con?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who took the opportunity for a a flying toy?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did anyone trade a puppy?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who was shouting out loud?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1552, "span_end": 1645, "span_text": " Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello!

It then jumped the curb and rushed through a grassy expanse before plunging down an embankment toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911. \n\nKenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window. \n\n\"I have a fear of water,\" Kenny said now. \"I almost drowned when I was nine.\" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. \"I couldn't just leave her,\" he adds. \n\nThe men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt. \n\n\"Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,\" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl. \n\nThat's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. \"I flipped into rescue mode,\" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out. \n\nMarcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock. \n\n\"Give her CPR!\" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. \"Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,\" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, \"Pump her chest!\" \n\n\"We tried three times,\" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers.

This year, a worried-looking couple approached me. Their son, who had a sickly childhood, really wanted to play football. They'd tried to talk him out of it, but he had his heart set on joining the team. \n\nWhen they told me his name , my heart sank. Michael was short and thin. He was a lonely kid and the constant target of other kids' jokes. I knew Michael would never make it. But so close to my \"football is for everyone\" speech, I told them we could give it a try. \n\nOn the opening day of practice, Michael was the first player on the field. We started a one-mile jog around the track. Repeatedly he fell, each time picking himself up. The same thing happened for weeks. But Michael put his whole heart into the training. Cradually, Michael gained strength both socially and physically. He began to laugh and most of the teammates became friendly. By the last week of practice Michael could run the mile without falling. He asked me to add a few more exercises he could work on his own. Soon , Michael ran the opening mile faster than anyone. \n\nOne day after practice, the team captain, Steve, came up to me. He was talented but lazy.He was popular with students even though he could be heartless. Steve pointed to the field where Michael was jogging all alone and asked me why he was still out there. I told Steve to ask him. The next night, I was surprised to see Steve exercising right next to Michael. \n\nFinally our big game came-at first we were losing by twelve points. I could see that some kids had already lost heart. But Michael was playing as hard as he could , begging the team to keep trying. Finally we won the game by one point in the final ten seconds. \n\nAt our celebration dinner, we always gave a big award to the most productive player. Steve had scored the most points that season, and everyone cheered as he received his award. \" There's someone who deserves it more than I do,\" Steve said, \" Everything I accomplished, and everything the team accomplished this season, is thanks to one person-Michael. \" The entire team cheered as Steve turned the prize over to the player who had inspired them all.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the story about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was the skinny kid?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was he the team captain?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did he have a big heart?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was he lazy?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who ran the fastest mile on the team?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did they win their game?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "By how many points?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who won the big award at years end?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who did he give the trophy to?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why was that?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What was the coaches name?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who gave up during the big game?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 41, "span_end": 64, "span_text": "a speech about football", "input_text": "football", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 431, "span_end": 438, "span_text": "Michael", "input_text": "Michael", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 728, "span_text": " Michael was the first player on the field.

When she did descend she beheld words chalked upon the sloping face of the bureau; but no husband or sons. In the hastily-scrawled lines Shadrach said they had gone off thus not to pain her by a leave-taking; and the sons had chalked under his words: 'Good- bye, mother!' \n\nShe rushed to the quay, and looked down the harbour towards the blue rim of the sea, but she could only see the masts and bulging sails of the _Joanna_; no human figures. ''Tis I have sent them!' she said wildly, and burst into tears. In the house the chalked 'Good-bye' nearly broke her heart. But when she had re-entered the front room, and looked across at Emily's, a gleam of triumph lit her thin face at her anticipated release from the thraldom of subservience. \n\nTo do Emily Lester justice, her assumption of superiority was mainly a figment of Joanna's brain.

But he had a fancy for James Ray and for me, and he often took me into the woods with him by day, and talked with me of an evening. \n\n\"I'm going away to Virginia, Davy,\" he said; \"will you not go with me? We'll see Williamsburg, and come back in the spring, and I'll have you a little rifle made.\" \n\nMy look must have been wistful. \n\n\"I can't leave Polly Ann and Tom,\" I answered. \n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I like that. Faith to your friends is a big equipment for life.\" \n\n\"But why are you going?\" I asked. \n\n\"Because I love Kentucky best of all things in the world,\" he answered, smiling. \n\n\"And what are you going to do?\" I insisted. \n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"that I can't tell even to you.\" \n\n\"To catch Hamilton?\" I ventured at random. \n\nHe looked at me queerly. \n\n\"Would you go along, Davy?\" said he, laughing now. \n\n\"Would you take Tom?\" \n\n\"Among the first,\" answered Colonel Clark, heartily. \n\nWe were seated under the elm near the spring, and at that instant I saw Tom coming toward us. I jumped up, thinking to please him by this intelligence, when Colonel Clark pulled me down again. \n\n\"Davy,\" said he, almost roughly, I thought, \"remember that we have been joking. Do you understand?--joking. You have a tongue in your mouth, but sense enough in your head, I believe, to hold it.\" He turned to Tom. \"McChesney, this is a queer lad you brought us,\" said he.

Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. \n\nThese technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. \n\nThe concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily.

Mangold wanted to make the set-in-Japan film similar to \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" by making the mutant a Josey Wales with healing powers. Jackman hadn't seen the classic Clint Eastwood film, so Mangold sent him a copy. \n\n\"I felt like tonally, it would give him a clue of what I was talking about,\" the director said. \n\nThe director started thinking about the deep affinity between gun-slinging Westerns and swordfighting samurai films. Mangold thought that drawing upon both of them would help \"The Wolverine\" stand apart from the rest of the X-Men series. \n\nThis installment takes place after \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" as Wolverine retreats from killing the love of his life, Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix, and heads to Japan. It is based on the comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, and Mangold thought of it as Hugh Jackman in a Western in Japan, without the horse. To make sense of this movie mashup, the director tweeted images from the top ten inspirations for \"The Wolverine,\" daring fans to identify them. \n\nAstute fans of Mangold's body of work (which includes \"Cop Land,\" \"Walk the Line\" and \"3:10 to Yuma\") might have spotted the 1959 Yasujiro Ozu film \"Floating Weeds,\" since the director has cited it as one of the best films of all time as well as a major influence on his first film, \"Heavy.\" \n\n\"Ozu is the most underappreciated Japanese director, in my mind,\" Mangold said. \"For me, the whole trip that Logan takes south to the Nagasaki area, it's almost the reverse train trip that the older couple take in 'Tokyo Story.' \" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "When does the installment take place?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What movie had Jackman not seen?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where is Wolverine headed in the film?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is the director?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where was the film set?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the Wolverine based on?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who is the comic by?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who tweeted images?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who is Yasujiro Ozu?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did Mangold send Jackman a copy of a film?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What film?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 712, "span_end": 771, "span_text": "This installment takes place after \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\"", "input_text": "after \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\"", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 291, "span_end": 342, "span_text": "Jackman hadn't seen the classic Clint Eastwood film", "input_text": "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 853, "span_end": 871, "span_text": "and heads to Japan", "input_text": "Japan", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 33, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "called his director for \"The Wolverine,\" James Mangold", "input_text": "James Mangold", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 177, "span_end": 198, "span_text": "the set-in-Japan film", "input_text": "Japan", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 873, "span_end": 897, "span_text": "It is based on the comic", "input_text": "a comic", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 879, "span_end": 933, "span_text": "based on the comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller", "input_text": "Chris Claremont and Frank Miller", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1055, "span_end": 1082, "span_text": "the director tweeted images", "input_text": "the director", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1461, "span_end": 1511, "span_text": "Ozu is the most underappreciated Japanese director", "input_text": "a Japanese director", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 344, "span_end": 372, "span_text": "so Mangold sent him a copy.

by CNN from the American Center for Law and Justice and was translated from its original Farsi by the Confederation of Iranian Students in Washington. \n\nIt goes on to say that during the court proceeding, Nadarkhani denied the prophecy of Mohammad and the authority of Islam. \n\n\"He (Nadarkhani) has stated that he is a Christian and no longer Muslim,\" states the brief. \"During many

He had had several experiences with wildcats and knew them to be both powerful and bloodthirsty. \n\nBy instinct more than reason he dived and went down as far as possible. As soon as the water closed over the wildcat's head it let go its hold and began to swim for the shore. \n\nHenry was directly in the path of the beast and in a second more, ere the young soldier had time to think of diving, the wildcat was on his back, sinking its cruel nails deeply into his flesh. \n\n\"Get off!\" screamed Henry. \"Get off! Help! help!\" \n\nAnd then he went down, not because he thought of doing so, but because he could not bear the weight. The stream closed over him and he went directly to the bottom. \n\nThis time the wildcat did not let go its hold.

The small Mayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in sight. \n\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to \"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters. \n\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the corner of the street ahead.

have known that trouble was coming,not only for himself,but for every big dog,strong of muscle and with long,warm hair in California.Men had found gold in the Yukon,and these men wanted big,strong dogs to work in the cold and snow of the north. \n\nBuck lived at a big house in the sunkissed Santa Clara valley.Judge Miller's place,it was called.There were large gardens and fields of fruit trees around the house,and a river nearby.In a big place like this,of course,there were many dogs.There were house dogs and farm dogs,but they were not important.Over this great land Buck ruled.Here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life.He was not so large--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds.But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere housedog.Hunting and outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles.He went swimming with Judge Miller's sons,and walking with his daughters.He carried the grandchildren on his back,and he sat at Judge Miller's feet in front of the warm library fire in winter.During the four years,he had a fine pride in himself which came of good living and universal respect.He was king of Judge Miller's place. \n\nBut this was 1897,and Buck did not know that men and dogs were hurrying to northwest Canada to look for gold.And he did not know that Manuel,one of the gardener's helpers,was in bad need of money for his hobby of gambling and for his large family.One day,the Judge was at a meeting and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club.No one saw Manuel and Buck go off on what Buck imagined was merely an evening walk.Only one man saw them arrive at the railway station.This man talked to Manuel,and gave him some money.Then Manuel tied a piece of rope around Buck's neck. \n\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity .He had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit.But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands,Buck roared,and was surprised when the rope tightened around his neck,shutting off his breath.In extreme anger,he jumped at the man.The man caught him and suddenly Buck was thrown over on his back.Then the rope tightened cruelly while Buck struggled,his tongue out of his mouth.Never in all his life had he been so badly treated.Never in all his life had he been so angry.For a few moments he was unable to move,and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train. \n\nWhen Buck woke up,the train was still moving.The man was sitting and watching him,but Buck was too quick for him and he bit the man's hand hard.Then the rope was pulled again and Buck had to let go. \n\nThat evening,the man took Buck to the back room of a bar in San Francisco.The barman looked at the man's hand and trousers covered in blood. \n\n\"How much are they paying you for this?\"he asked. \n\n\"Only get fifty dollars.\" \n\n\"And the man who stole him--how much did he get?\"asked the barman. \n\n\"A hundred.He wouldn't take less.\" \n\n\"That makes a hundred and fifty.It's a good price for a dog like him.\" \n\nBuck spent that night in a cagelike box.He could not understand what it all meant.What did they want with him,these strange men?And where were Judge Miller and the boys? \n\nThe next day Buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train to the north.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What type of building does Buck live in?",

The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the equator made S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe ideal for sugar cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as coffee and cocoa; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful independence in 1975.

The popular choices in 1980 were: 1.3:1 (based on television standard's ratio at the time), 1.6:1 (the European \"flat\" ratio), 1.85:1 (the American \"flat\" ratio), 2.20:1 (the ratio of 70\u00a0mm films and Panavision) and 2.39:1 (the CinemaScope ratio for anamorphic widescreen films). \n\nPowers cut out rectangles with equal areas, shaped to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.7:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.7:1.

Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. \n\nThe city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower').

The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans.

The GNU project includes an operating system kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). However, non-GNU kernels, most famously Linux, can also be used with GNU software; as the Hurd kernel is not yet production-ready, this is how the GNU system is usually used. The combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is commonly known as Linux (or less frequently GNU/Linux; see GNU/Linux naming controversy). \n\nRichard Stallman, the founder of the project, views GNU as a \"technical means to a social end\". Relatedly Lawrence Lessig states in his introduction to the second edition of Stallman's book \"Free Software, Free Society\" that in it Stallman has written about \"the social aspects of software and how Free Software can create community and social justice.\" \n\nDevelopment of the GNU operating system was initiated by Richard Stallman while he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was called the GNU Project, and was publicly announced on September 27, 1983, on the net.unix-wizards and net.usoft newsgroups by Richard Stallman. Software development began on January 5, 1984, when Stallman quit his job at the Lab so that they could not claim ownership or interfere with distributing GNU components as free software.

The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face. This caused John's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles.

Brar, Indian defense spokesman for the disputed Kashmir region, said there were two violations of the cease-fire on the Line of Control, the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the first, fighting continued for about an hour, he said. A second violation took place Thursday morning, he said, and one Indian soldier was injured. Brar said he could not comment on Pakistani casualties. \n\nPakistani officials said severe weather conditions in Kashmir, a Himalayan region, hampered removal of the soldiers' bodies. Pakistan has asked the Indian local commanding authority for a full report on the incident. \n\nIndia and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir, which is claimed by both nuclear powers. \n\nOn August 20, an Indian army officer and five militants were killed in clashes along the Line of Control. India has accused Pakistan of aiding infiltration into Indian Kashmir, which has battled separatist violence for more than two decades. Islamabad has denied the accusations.

Only one fish egg remains, Nemo. Martin promises his dead wife that he will protect his young son at any cost. So, Martin becomes fearful of almost everything in the ocean. That makes him over protective-he hopes to keep his kid safe from the challenges that life presents. Martin's nagging makes Nemo feel that he doesn't need his dad telling him what to do. \n\nSo on his first day of school, Nemo and some friends swim to the edge of their coral reef, a place Martin always thinks is very dangerous. When Martin shouts at Nemo come back, Nemo refuses to listen to him and swim out to a boat in the distance. Suddenly, he gets caught by some divers. So begins Martin's journey to find Nemo, who ends up in an aquarium in an office in Australia. Soon the worried father runs into Dory, a forgetful blue fish, who helps Martin find his son. Meanwhile, Nemo misses his father terribly. He soon hears that he will be given to an eight-year-old girl who likes to kill fish. \n\nCan Martin find his son before it is too late? \n\nFinding Nemo is a physical and mental journey.
