The night was very dark and the narrow little Carrefour de la Poissonnerie very sparsely lighted. Somewhere overhead on the right, something groaned and creaked persistently in the wind. A little further on a street lanthorn was swinging aloft, throwing a small circle of dim, yellowish light on the unpaved street below. By its fitful glimmer Yvonne could vaguely perceive the tall figure of her guide as he stepped out with noiseless yet firm tread, his shoulder brushing against the side of the nearest house as he kept closely within the shadow of its high wall. The sight of his broad back thrilled her. She had fallen to imagining whether this was not perchance that gallant and all-powerful Scarlet Pimpernel himself: the mysterious friend of whom her dear milor so often spoke with an admiration that was akin to worship. He too was probably tall and broad--for English gentlemen were usually built that way; and Yvonne's over-excited mind went galloping on the wings of fancy, and in her heart she felt that she was glad that she had suffered so much, and then lived through such a glorious moment as this. \n\nNow from the narrow unpaved yard in front of the house the guide turned sharply to the right. Yvonne could only distinguish outlines. The streets of Nantes were familiar to her, and she knew pretty well where she was. The lanthorn inside the clock tower of Le Bouffay guided her--it was now on her right--the house wherein she had been kept a prisoner these past three days was built against the walls of the great prison house.

As of 2017, there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, \"Spectre\" (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.

Legally, the term is used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in Greece, Italy, the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. \n\nAlbanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects as well as a plethora of other reasons including ecclesiastical decay, coercion by Ottoman authorities in times of war, and the privileged legal and social position of Muslims. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world.

Shortly after Muhammad's death, the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it.

Baskin and Robbins realized that they were too busy to operate each store well. So, they decided to sell part of each operation to the manager of that store. This permitted the company to grow quickly. \n\nBy 1953, they renamed their company Baskin-Robbins. They advertised that they sold 31 kinds of ice cream to show the many choices buyers had. There was one flavor for every day of the month. \n\nRobbins and Baskin sold \"Lunar Cheesecake \" the day after astronauts landed on the moon in 1969. Other flavors included \"ChaChaCha\", for cherry chocolate chip, and Robbins' personal favorite \"Jamoca Almond Fudge\". They said, \"We sell fun, not just ice cream.\" \n\nBy 1967, there were 500 Baskin-Robbins stores in the United States. The business partners sold their company that year.

Completed in 1844, it is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his co-author Auguste Maquet. \n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean, and in the Levant during the historical events of 1815-1838. It begins from just before the Hundred Days period, when Napoleon returned to power after his exile , and goes through to the time of Louis Philippe of France. The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, revenge , mercy and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story. It focuses on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from prison, gains a fortune and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have terrible consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. \n\nDumas got the idea for The Count of Monte Cristo from a true story, which he found in a memoir written by a man named Jacques Peuchet. Peuchet related the story of a shoemaker named Pierre Picaud, who was living in Paris in 1807. Picaud was engaged to a rich woman, but four envious friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. He was imprisoned for seven years. During his imprisonment a fellow prisoner told him a treasure hidden in Milan. When Picaud was released in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Paris and spent ten years plotting his successful revenge. \n\nThe book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \" The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood. \"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What book is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is this story completly made up or based on real life events?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where does the story take place?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is Jacques Peachet?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does Luc Sante say about the story?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is Pierre Picaud's Job?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many years was he in jail?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "how many friends lied about him", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where was the treasure hiding?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was he set free?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 733, "span_end": 779, "span_text": "hope, justice, revenge , mercy and forgiveness", "input_text": "hope, justice, revenge , mercy and forgiveness", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1134, "span_end": 1194, "span_text": "true story, which he found in a memoir written by a man name", "input_text": "real life events", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 346, "span_end": 409, "span_text": "France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean, and in the Levant ", "input_text": "France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean, and in the Levant", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1166, "span_end": 1172, "span_text": "memoir", "input_text": "wrote memoir", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1805, "span_end": 1852, "span_text": "a fixture of western civilization's literature,", "input_text": "it is a fixture of western civilization's literature", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1244, "span_end": 1253, "span_text": "shoemaker", "input_text": "shoemaker", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1439, "span_end": 1444, "span_text": "seven", "input_text": "seven", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1348, "span_end": 1352, "span_text": "four", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1524, "span_end": 1529, "span_text": "Milan", "input_text": "Milan", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1559, "span_end": 1563, "span_text": "1814", "input_text": "1814", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high17693.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3z4xg4zf48rnk1dgw0w5rjybe0b8xa", "filename": "Wireless_network.txt", "story": "A wireless network is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes. \n\nWireless networking is a method by which homes, telecommunications networks and business installations avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations.

He enjoyed it, except for the almost-nightly rocket attacks. Karl was never hit directly by a rocket, but he didn't need to be to feel its effects. The rockets caused severe shaking, shaking so bad that Fleming was left with many injuries. He was also diagnosed with concussions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). \n\nFleming said he was down but not out. Once he returned from Afghanistan, Fleming underwent one test after another. At first, Fleming said he thought he could recover or be able to return to duty and realize his dream of becoming an officer. But then came the news he had never imagined: Fleming would never be an officer because he was too injured to continue. \n\nFleming said he was depressed after learning his military career was over. Add that to the memory loss, extreme anxiety and the many painful medical procedures he was already experiencing. He rarely ventured outside on the weekend. Instead, he preferred to sleep in. All that changed, however, with Fleming's service dog, Kuchar. \n\nFleming said he had heard dogs could help people suffering from PTSD, so he started doing research. Karl eventually selected K9s for Warriors, which is where he met Kuchar, a yellow lab. Fleming and Kuchar trained together for weeks, before returning to Fort Benning. K9s for Warriors provided Fleming with Kuchar and the training for free. \n\nLife with Kuchar has been life-changing. Fleming doesn't sleep in any more because Kuchar won't let him.

The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston.

They spent two days beginning the task of formulating ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing. \n\n\"Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,\" said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. \"Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,\" he added. \n\nPhotographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. \"This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column there that used to be part of that building,\" explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. \"The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.\" \n\nThe visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris to survive. \"Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance,\" he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\" said A. Whittaker. \"We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it.\" \n\nA. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that \"earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are engineers trying to solve?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What question is that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who funded the project?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where did they travel to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where is ground zero?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does M.

They are all decorated with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows. Chen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers or posters. Then I thought of replacing them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said. To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows. In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display wall to show students' works. Through the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun.

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. \n\nZeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom the \"Iliad\" states that he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses. \n\nHe was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". Zeus' symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (Greek: , \"Nephel\u0113gereta\") also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter.

The Transcaucasus extends eastwards to the Caspian Sea and northwestern Iran, and extends westwards into northeastern Turkey. \n\nThe region is known for its linguistic diversity: aside from Indo-European and Turkic languages, the Kartvelian, Northwest Caucasian, and Northeast Caucasian families are indigenous to the area. \n\nPliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" (77\u201379 AD) derives the name of the Caucasus from Scythian \"kroy-khasis\" (\"ice-shining, white with snow\"). German linguist Paul Kretschmer notes that the Latvian word \"Kruvesis\" also means \"ice\". \n\nIn the \"Tale of Past Years\" (1113 AD), it is stated that Old East Slavic \u041a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u044b\u0463 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044b (\"Kavkasijsky\u011b gory\") came from Ancient Greek \u039a\u03b1\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Kafkasos\"), which, according to M.

After some minutes, he returned, with his legs thoroughly stretched, if the hue of his nose and a short hiccup afforded any criterion; and at the same time there came out of the yard a rusty pony-chaise, and a cart, driven by two labouring men. \n\n'Put the boys and the boxes into the cart,' said Squeers, rubbing his hands; 'and this young man and me will go on in the chaise. Get in, Nickleby.' \n\nNicholas obeyed. Mr. Squeers with some difficulty inducing the pony to obey also, they started off, leaving the cart-load of infant misery to follow at leisure. \n\n'Are you cold, Nickleby?' inquired Squeers, after they had travelled some distance in silence. \n\n'Rather, sir, I must say.' \n\n'Well, I don't find fault with that,' said Squeers; 'it's a long journey this weather.' \n\n'Is it much farther to Dotheboys Hall, sir?' asked Nicholas. \n\n'About three mile from here,' replied Squeers.

Some strange shadowy dreams, to be sure, disturbed the lethargy into which he fell soon after; but they were intermittent and indefinite. He was vaguely aware of being lifted with gentle care into somebody's arms, and of the somebody staggering along with him, not without considerable difficulty, over the rough stony ground of that South African plateau. He remembered also, as in a trance, some sound of angry voices--a loud expostulation--a hasty palaver--a long slow pause--a gradual sense of reconciliation and friendliness--during all which, as far as he could recover the circumstances afterwards, he must have been extended on the earth, with his back propped against a great ledge of jutting rock, and his head hanging listless on his sinking breast. Thenceforward all was blank, or just dimly perceived at long intervals between delirium and unconsciousness. He was ill for many days, where or how he knew not. \n\nIn some half dreamy way, he was aware too, now and again, of strange voices by his side, strange faces tending him. But they were black faces, all, and the voices spoke in deep guttural tones, unlike even the clicks and harsh Bantu jerks with which he had grown so familiar in eighteen months among the Barolong. This that he heard now, or seemed to hear in his delirium, like distant sounds of water, was a wholly different and very much harsher tongue--the tongue of the Namaquas, in fact, though Granville was far too ill and too drowsy just then to think of reasoning about it or classifying it in any way. All he knew for the moment was that sometimes, when he turned round feebly on his bed of straw, and asked for drink or help in a faltering voice, no white man appeared to answer his summons.

But when reflection came with the morning her misery was stronger than her wrath. What would life be to her now without her lover? When she escaped from her grandfather's house she certainly had not intended to become nurse and assistant maid-of-all-work at a London lodging-house. The daily toil she could endure, and the hard life, as long as she was supported by the prospect of some coming delight. A dance with Felix at the Music Hall, though it were three days distant from her, would so occupy her mind that she could wash and dress all the children without complaint. Mrs Pipkin was forced to own to herself that Ruby did earn her bread. But when she had parted with her lover almost on an understanding that they were never to meet again, things were very different with her. And perhaps she had been wrong. A gentleman like Sir Felix did not of course like to be told about marriage. If she gave him another chance, perhaps he would speak. At any rate she could not live without another dance. And so she wrote him a letter. \n\nRuby was glib enough with her pen, though what she wrote will hardly bear repeating. She underscored all her loves to him. She underscored the expression of her regret if she had vexed him. She did not want to hurry a gentleman. But she did want to have another dance at the Music Hall. Would he be there next Saturday?

This is in contrast to experimental physics, which uses experimental tools to probe these phenomena. \n\nThe advancement of science generally depends on the interplay between experimental studies and theory. In some cases, theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigor while giving little weight to experiments and observations. For example, while developing special relativity, Albert Einstein was concerned with the Lorentz transformation which left Maxwell's equations invariant, but was apparently uninterested in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment on Earth's drift through a luminiferous ether. Conversely, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect, previously an experimental result lacking a theoretical formulation. \n\nA physical theory is a model of physical events. It is judged by the extent to which its predictions agree with empirical observations. The quality of a physical theory is also judged on its ability to make new predictions which can be verified by new observations. A physical theory differs from a mathematical theorem in that while both are based on some form of axioms, judgment of mathematical applicability is not based on agreement with any experimental results. A physical theory similarly differs from a mathematical theory, in the sense that the word \"theory\" has a different meaning in mathematical terms. A physical theory involves one or more relationships between various measurable quantities. Archimedes realized that a ship floats by displacing its mass of water, Pythagoras understood the relation between the length of a vibrating string and the musical tone it produces.

The updated Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes and online, with 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives. \n\nSeeking to emulate national biographical collections published elsewhere in Europe, such as the \"Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie\" (1875), in 1882 the publisher George Smith (1824\u20131901), of Smith, Elder & Co., planned a universal dictionary that would include biographical entries on individuals from world history. He approached Leslie Stephen, then editor of the \"Cornhill Magazine\", owned by Smith, to become editor. Stephen persuaded Smith that the work should focus on subjects from the UK and its present and former colonies only. An early working title was the \"Biographia Britannica\", the name of an earlier eighteenth-century reference work. \n\nThe first volume of the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" appeared on 1 January 1885. In May 1891 Leslie Stephen resigned and Sidney Lee, Stephen's assistant editor from the beginning of the project, succeeded him as editor. A dedicated team of sub-editors and researchers worked under Stephen and Lee, combining a variety of talents from veteran journalists to young scholars who cut their academic teeth on dictionary articles at a time when postgraduate historical research in British universities was still in its infancy. While much of the dictionary was written in-house, the \"DNB\" also relied on external contributors, who included several respected writers and scholars of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, more than 700 individuals had contributed to the work. Successive volumes appeared quarterly with complete punctuality until midsummer 1900, when the series closed with volume 63.

After that outdoor exertion he had been playing billiards, and thus the hours had passed without his dwelling at all on the prospect of meeting Gwendolen at dinner. Nevertheless that prospect was interesting to him; and when, a little tired and heated with working at amusement, he went to his room before the half-hour bell had rung, he began to think of it with some speculation on the sort of influence her marriage with Grandcourt would have on her, and on the probability that there would be some discernible shades of change in her manner since he saw her at Diplow, just as there had been since his first vision of her at Leubronn.

The independent label holds the copyrights to music by the Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, the Animals, the Kinks, Chubby Checker, Bobby Womack and hundreds of others. \n\nKlein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits. He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings. \n\nKnown for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles. \n\nABKCO built up a catalog of copyrights to more than 2,000 songs, including much of the Stones' 1960s catalog. Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones. In 1969, John Lennon persuaded the other Beatles that Klein should take over the group's business affairs, but Paul McCartney resisted the move and some music historians say the appointment hastened the Beatles' split. \n\nLennon later fell out with Klein, who was thought to be the target of the former Beatle's 1974 song \"Steel and Glass.\" \n\nDefending his tough style, Klein told Playboy magazine in 1971: \"The music business is about 99 percent no-talent losers who can't stand a winner in their midst.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the founder of Allen Klein & Co.?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When did it start?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is it now?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where is it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who was the manger of the Rolling Stones?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is he still alive?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What condition did he have?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who was the manager of the Beatles?", "turn_id": 9}], "answers": [{"span_start": 9, "span_end": 34, "span_text": "Music manager Allen Klein", "input_text": "Allen Klein", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 260, "span_end": 295, "span_text": "Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s", "input_text": "late 1950s", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 326, "span_end": 347, "span_text": "ABKCO Music & Records", "input_text": "ABKCO Music & Records", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 326, "span_end": 359, "span_text": "ABKCO Music & Records in New York", "input_text": "New York", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 837, "span_end": 906, "span_text": "Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones ", "input_text": "Klein", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 95, "span_end": 108, "span_text": "died Saturday", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 95, "span_end": 108, "span_text": "died Saturday", "input_text": "Saturday", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 116, "span_end": 156, "span_text": " lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease", "input_text": "Alzheimer's disease", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}], "name": "cnn_83b2a2f9192ee8617899714eecc0e27720f54ca1.story"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3krvw3htznlu99tlwr01xtiejlvsmx", "filename": "high2348.txt", "story": "Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29,1958 in Gary, Indiana.

Russian pianist Alexander Melnikov, who planned to give a concert of Mozart' s music on the piano on November 7, said he was privileged to play such an instrument.It's easily the biggest day of a musician' s life.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "what instrument was Melnikov going to play on Nov 7?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who looked after the piano since 1975?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what year had replacement strings been put in?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "when did Mozart die?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "where is his piano now?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "when did he buy the piano?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what museum has it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "is that his former home?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who donated the piano originally?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what is his son's name?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who did he get the piano from?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what was her first name?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "how many songs did Mozart compose on it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When Carl donated it, how old would Mozart have been?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "is the piano bigger or smaller than modern pianos?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "how does it sound in comparison?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "did Josef Meigast think it was inferior or superior?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1043, "span_end": 1480, "span_text": " Piano restorer Josef Meingast, who has looked after the Mozart piano since 1975, said it was superior to any of its surviving copies.Meingast said he had to fight to replace the existing strings , dating from a 1973 restoration, with softer ones that produce a rounder sound thought to be more similar to what Mozart would have produced.

He helped set up an April CNN interview with a woman who claimed she'd been raped by government troops. He later told CNN that those behind the attack should be prosecuted.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have been appointed. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism. \n\nA research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his Conservative government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election. \n\nOn moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983.

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,900 metres (16,000 ft). The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, earth's highest mountain rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship.

In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Collectively, they are known as CJKV characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. \n\nChinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. Simplified forms of certain characters are used in China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than Chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms (ky\u016bjitai), which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms. In South Korea, when Chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Bush is smart, most of them will probably tell you they don't think so. However, Bush's IQ score is estimated to be above 120, which puts him in the top ten percent of the population. \n\nIt doesn't seem to make sense. How come someone with such an IQ score is not considered smart? Researchers say: IQ does not tell the whole story. Some people have high IQ scores, but still they can be poor thinkers and decision-makers. \n\nKeith Stanovich, a Canadian professor of human development and applied psychology, has been looking into the \"clever fools\" phenomenon for 15 years. He says IQ tests are very good at measuring certain mental faculties , including logic, learning ability, working-memory capacity (how much information you can hold in mind), etc. Those faculties play a part in one's academic success, but rational thinking is more important for us to make good judgments in real-life situations. \n\nIQ tests fail to work when it comes to rational thinking. That's because they are unable to assess things such as a person's ability to weigh up information, or whether an individual can set aside the cognitive biases that may be misleading. \n\n\"A high IQ is like height in a basketball player,\" says David Perkins, who studies thinking and reasoning skills at Harvard University. \"It is very important, all other things being equal. But all other things aren't equal.

In between comes an unexpected name: Elizabeth Hoffman. Hoffman, now a 12thgrader, began learning Chinese in the eighth grade, has spent a summer studying in Nanjing and plans to perfect her Mandarin next fall. When asked by her peers---why she is learning Chinese, she responds with a question: \"why aren't you?\" \n\nAs China rushes toward superpower status, America's schools and government officials are responding to Hoffman's opinion. Earlier this year Eush Holt of New Jersey introduced legialation calling for increased money of programs for less commonly taught languages, \"For reasons of economics, culture and security, we should have much better facilities with Chinese languages and dialects,\" he said. The State Department has pointed out Chinese is becoming a \"critical language\", but the most recent data show that only 24,000 students in Grade 7 to Grade 12 study Chinese. \n\nStill, the number is growing. In Chicago public schools, enrollment in Chinese classes has skyrocked from 5000 students in 2005 to nearly 35,000 students this year. In the Santa Clara County, California, enrollment has quadrupled during the same period. In 2007, when the College Board first introduces advanced-placement language exams in Chinese and Italian, 2,400 high school plan to offer AP Chinese---10 times the number of students that plan to offer AP Italian. \n\nMuch of the interest can be explained by China's increasing competiviveness. \"People are always trying to judge what languages are going to be useful for the future,\" says Marty Abbot, the director of education at the National Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, Stephanie Wong, a student At Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California, chose Chinese so that she could speak with her grandfather. Wong also predicted that Chinese will be important if she becomes a doctor. 80 percent of people in her hometown are Asians.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the name of the school?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where was it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Whose name was unexpected?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What grade is she in?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What language is she learning?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why is she learning it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does she say when people ask her that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What status does China want to get?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many kids learn Chinese?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "In what grades?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Is the number growing or decreasing?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How many students enrolled to learn the language in 2005?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How did the number of enrolled students grow in California?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 22, "span_text": "At Dulles High school ", "input_text": "Dulles High school", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "At Dulles High school in Sugar Land, Texas", "input_text": "Sugar Land, Texas", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 163, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "Elizabeth Hoffman", "input_text": "Elizabeth Hoffman", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 182, "span_end": 208, "span_text": "Hoffman, now a 12thgrader,", "input_text": "12th", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 363, "span_end": 391, "span_text": "why she is learning Chinese,", "input_text": "Chinese,", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 390, "span_end": 440, "span_text": ", she responds with a question: \"why aren't you?\" ", "input_text": "\"why aren't you?\"", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 442, "span_end": 483, "span_text": "As China rushes toward superpower status,", "input_text": "superpower", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 954, "span_end": 1013, "span_text": "only 24,000 students in Grade 7 to Grade 12 study Chinese.

The \"Iliad\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \"Odyssey\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy. \n\nMany accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends. \n\nThe Homeric Question\u2014by whom, when, where and under what circumstances were the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" composed\u2014continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \"Iliad\" and (according to some) the \"Odyssey\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that \"Homer\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century BC.

It was a crucial turning point in his career, and it quickly became rock & roll legend -- the moment when Dylan transformed from a protest folkie to a rebel genius. But the guitar Dylan played on that mythic afternoon went missing for the next 47 years -- until recently, when a team of PBS researchers told New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson that she had it in her home. \n\nPeterson's late father, Victor Quinto, was a private pilot who worked for Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, in the mid-1960s. \"After one flight, my father saw there were three guitars left on the plane,\" she says. He contacted the company a few times about picking the guitars up, but nobody ever got back to him.\" \n\nLast fall, Peterson asked PBS's History Detectives to help verify her find. The 1964 Stratocaster came with 13 pages of typed and handwritten song lyrics tucked inside its guitar case -- but host Wes Cowan was skeptical at first. \"It's so important, historically and culturally, that I couldn't have imagined Bob Dylan would have just left it on an airplane,\" he says. \n\nIn fact, Dylan says that's not what happened. \"Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965,\" his attorney, Orin Snyder, said in a statement. \"He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What brand of guitar was Dylan playing", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where did he play?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "how long was his show", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what year was it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "where is the famous guitar now?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was found with the other guitars?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How did Quinto get the guitars", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who was Victor Quinto?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who was he contracted through?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who did Dawn contact about verifying the guitars authenticity", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did PBS have to do with it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "were they successful", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what brand of guitars were stolen", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "was the manager contacted about the guitars left on the plane?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 114, "span_end": 142, "span_text": "sunburst Fender Stratocaster", "input_text": "sunburst Fender Stratocaster", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 70, "span_end": 93, "span_text": " Newport Folk Festival,", "input_text": "Newport Folk Festival,", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 186, "span_text": " three-song set", "input_text": "three-song set", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 33, "span_end": 37, "span_text": "1965", "input_text": "1965", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1295, "span_end": 1314, "span_text": "\"Bob has possession", "input_text": "\"Bob has possession", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1007, "span_end": 1031, "span_text": " handwritten song lyrics", "input_text": "handwritten song lyrics", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 730, "span_end": 762, "span_text": " three guitars left on the plane", "input_text": "three guitars left on the plane", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 605, "span_end": 619, "span_text": " private pilot", "input_text": "private pilot", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 623, "span_end": 658, "span_text": " worked for Dylan's manager, Albert", "input_text": "worked for Dylan's manager, Albert", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 932, "span_end": 952, "span_text": "help verify her find", "input_text": "help verify her find", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "cnn_1877c871c7c01ba85ef6497f7bc69d30ade4ecd2.story"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3i7dhkzygn0nxx3ty8jg9sod72r5fk", "filename": "mc160.test.55", "story": "Tasha and Hassan went to their grandma's house.

Remarkably, he could read, yet, in spite of his reading skills, Steve was failing. He had been failing since first grade, as he was passed on from grade to grade. Steve was a big boy, looking more like a teenager than a twelve year old, yet, Steve went unnoticed... until Miss White. \n\nMiss White was a smiling, young, beautiful redhead, and Steve was in love! For the first time in his young life, he couldn't take his eyes off his teacher; yet, still he failed. He never did his homework, and he was always in trouble with Miss White. His heart would break under her sharp words, and when he was punished for failing to turn in his homework, he felt just miserable! Still, he did not study. \n\nIn the middle of the first semester of school, the entire seventh grade was tested for basic skills. Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things, as the day wore on. His heart was not in school, but in the woods, where he often escaped alone, trying to shut out the sights, sounds and smells of his alcoholic home. No one checked on him to see if he was safe. No one knew he was gone, because no one was sober enough to care. Oddly, Steve never missed a day of school. \n\nOne day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \"Steve!!\" Startled, he turned to look at her. \n\n\"Pay attention!\" \n\nSteve locked his gaze on Miss White with adolescent adoration , as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \n\n\"You all did pretty well,\" she told the class, \"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\" She hesitated, pinning Steve to his seat with a sharp stare, her eyes searching his face. \n\n\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\" \n\nShe just stared at Steve, as the class spun around for a good look. Steve dropped his eyes and carefully examined his fingertips. \n\nAfter that, it was war!! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained stubborn. \n\n\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\" He was unmoved. \n\n\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\" Nothing fazed him. \n\n\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\" Nothing. \n\n\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\" \n\nWow! Suddenly, Steve got it!! Someone cared about him? Someone, totally unattainable and perfect, CARED ABOUT HIM??!! \n\nSteve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, he took one look around. Both parents were passed out, in various stages of undress, and the stench was overpowering! He, quickly, gathered up his camping gear, a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. Grim faced and determined, he headed for the woods. \n\nThe following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all sparkle and smiles! God, she was beautiful! He yearned for her smile to turn on him. It did not. \n\nMiss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test, and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Steve walked back to his desk, his heart pounding within his chest. As he sat down, he couldn't resist another look at the lovely woman. \n\nMiss White's face was in total shock! She glanced up at Steve, then down, then up. Suddenly, her face broke into a radiant smile. The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! \n\nFrom that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! \n\nHe discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge, and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life. Steve began to excel! And he continued this course throughout his school life. \n\nAfter high-school Steve enlisted in the Navy, and he had a successful military career. During that time, he met the love of his life, he raised a family, and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude. During his Naval career, he inspired many young people, who without him, might not have believed in themselves. Steve began a second career after the Navy, and he continues to inspire others, as an adjunct professor in a nearby college. \n\nMiss White left a great legacy. She saved one boy who has changed many lives. I know, because I am the love of his life. \n\nYou see, it's simple, really. A change took place within the heart of one boy, all because of one teacher, who cared.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was Steve in love with?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did she look like?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was Steve successful in class?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did he ever do homework?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What grade was he in?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many days was he absent?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who did the teacher imply was the smartest male in his grade?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did he gather up one day at home?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What made Miss White grin?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did he find out that he was bad at learning?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was his career?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did he have any other jobs?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "At what type of school?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did he have kids?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 320, "span_end": 330, "span_text": "Miss White", "input_text": "Miss White", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 337, "span_end": 370, "span_text": "smiling, young, beautiful redhead", "input_text": "smiling, young, beautiful redhead", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 498, "span_end": 553, "span_text": "He never did his homework, and he was always in trouble", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 498, "span_end": 523, "span_text": "He never did his homework", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 787, "span_end": 800, "span_text": "seventh grade", "input_text": "seventh grade", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1190, "span_end": 1226, "span_text": "Steve never missed a day of school.

The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. \n\nIt was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, \"I can stay\". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. \n\nWe got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll \"Never\" forget. \n\nOn Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast.

After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. \n\nWhen we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock.

America's best known and most honored serious writers. But his fame came late in his life. He was born in San Francisco, California in 1874. He lived in California during his early childhood. He was named after the chief Southern general in America's Civil War. The general's name was Robert Edward Lee. The poet was named Robert Lee Frost, because his father wanted to honor the general. Someone once asked another American writer, Ernest Hemingway, how to become a writer. The best thing, he said, was to have an unhappy childhood. If this is true, Robert Frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very good writer. Robert Frost's father was a reporter who wanted to be a politician. He often drank too much wine and became angry. Robert was the victim of his anger. Robert Frost finished high school in 1891. After high school, Robert's grandfather offered to pay his costs at Dartmouth College. But Robert left the school after a few months. He did not like it. He spent the next few years working at different jobs. At one time, he worked in a factory. Later, he repaired shoes. He was a teacher. He was a reporter. Always, he wrote poetry. Robert Frost attended Harvard University for two years. After that, he returned to the many jobs he held before. For a while, Frost tried to take care of a farm in the state of New Hampshire. He was not a successful farmer. And he continued to write poetry. He said that until 1930, he earned only about ten dollars a year from writing. In 1912, he decided to try to make a new start. He took his family to Britain. The cost of living was low. In Britain, Frost found a publisher for his first book of poems. The book was called A Boy's Will. When it appeared in 1913. Frost received high praise from British readers. Praise was something he had not received in his own country. Ezra Pound, another American poet living in Britain, read the poems and liked them very much. He wrote a magazine article about Frost.

Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and Tyneside the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974.[not in citation given] The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. \n\nThe city developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son. The city grew as an important centre for the wool trade in the 14th century, and later became a major coal mining area. The port developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the River Tyne, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres.

He surprised everyone around him. \n\nAmazed that he remembered this long and difficult piece of music and played it perfectly, his teachers say Samuel is unbelievable .They say his ability is very rare, but Samuel doesn't even realize that what he can do is special. Samuel wanted to become a lawyer as it was the wish of his parents, but music teachers told him he should study music instead. Now, he studies law and music. \n\nSamuel can't understand why everyone is so surprised. \"I grew up with music. My mother played the piano and my father played the guitar.

The piece had more than a thousand notes. The audience was impressed by his amazing performance. He is now learning a piece that is so difficult that many professional pianists can't play it.

Friedman has taken on a green hue with his latest book, \"Hot, Flat and Crowded\". \n\nUnlike Gore, Friedman is a distinctly different shade of green, a deeply pragmatic green that believes economic forces can usher in a revolution in environmental policy.

He is approaching it from a philosophical standpoint. \n\nGreen capital \n\nFriedman's new book \"Hot, Flat and Crowded\" is not a major departure from his previous books. Whether he's discussing globalization or green industry, he is writing from his deep-seated belief in the markets. He is an unabashed capitalist. \n\nFor Friedman, the system works but it's not immune to bad decision-making. Green industry like globalization will come of age if given the right market environment. His faith in capitalism is equal to that in green technology -- for him, these are two things that are clearly reconcilable. \n\nSo how do we do this? America as the bastion for innovation, Friedman argues, should play a big role. In fact, he confesses it really isn't a book about the environment and energy, its a book about America. For Friedman, America is slipping down the ranks of hegemonic power and climate change is its big chance to reposition itself as a global leader.

Perhaps that's why she feels compelled to head back home when she receives an e-mail from an ex-boyfriend, Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), announcing the birth of his first child.

This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago.[citation needed] This capacity is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form. Some aspects of human behavior, such as language, social practices such as kinship, gender and marriage, expressive forms such as art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies such as cooking, shelter, clothing are said to be cultural universals, found in all human societies. The concept material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including, practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science make up the intangible cultural heritage of a society.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is Cambridge English Dictionary describing?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Culture is a central concept in what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What kind of learning is anthropology interested in?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did creativity begin to be seen in humans?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is an example of a social practice?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is music an expressive form?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is art an expressive form?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are there other examples?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is an example of a technology?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Any other?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are these found in every human society?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is an example of a material aspect of culture?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What about immaterial aspects?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What theory says that culture is an illusion?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What species of human does the theory mention?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What kind of brain did they have?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Does culture involve a specific time?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What illusion does culture provide?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Individuals of what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Are cultural universals found in all societies?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 20, "span_end": 56, "span_text": "ctionary states that culture is, \"th", "input_text": "culture", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 598, "span_end": 629, "span_text": "central concept in anthropology", "input_text": "anthropology", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 695, "span_end": 719, "span_text": " social learning in huma", "input_text": "social learning", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 960, "span_end": 980, "span_text": "und 50,000 years ago", "input_text": "maybe around 50,000 years ago", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1430, "span_end": 1483, "span_text": "social practices such as kinship, gender and marriage", "input_text": "kinship, gender and marriage", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1487, "span_end": 1622, "span_text": "pressive forms such as art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies such as cooking, shelter, clothing are said to be cultural", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1485, "span_end": 1513, "span_text": "expressive forms such as art", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1529, "span_end": 1569, "span_text": "ritual, religion, and technologies such ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1550, "span_end": 1581, "span_text": " technologies such as cooking, ", "input_text": "cooking", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1551, "span_end": 1593, "span_text": "technologies such as cooking, shelter, clo", "input_text": "Yes,  shelter, clothing", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1635, "span_end": 1664, "span_text": "found in all human societies.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1677, "span_end": 1756, "span_text": "material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology", "input_text": "technology", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1792, "span_end": 1864, "span_text": "immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization ", "input_text": "mythology", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 170, "span_end": 194, "span_text": "Terror Management Theory", "input_text": "Terror Management Theory", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 467, "span_end": 503, "span_text": " Homo Sapiens became aware of when t", "input_text": "Homo Sapiens", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 503, "span_end": 557, "span_text": "hey acquired a larger brain. \n\nAs a defining aspect of", "input_text": "larger", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 58, "span_end": 193, "span_text": "way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time.\" Terror Management Theor", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 285, "span_end": 314, "span_text": "illusion of being individuals", "input_text": "being individual", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 316, "span_end": 329, "span_text": "f value in a ", "input_text": "value", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 633, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "compassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies.

Historically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest. \n\nThe early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation, with many of the aspects that survive today, including regional government of shires and hundreds. During this period, Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language. Charters and law were also established. The term \"Anglo-Saxon\" is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century. In scholarly use, it is more commonly called Old English. \n\nThe history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity. It developed from divergent groups in association with the people's adoption of Christianity, and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms. Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England, this identity was re-established; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest. The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings, dress styles, illuminated texts and grave goods. Behind the symbolic nature of these cultural emblems, there are strong elements of tribal and lordship ties. The elite declared themselves as kings who developed \"burhs\", and identified their roles and peoples in Biblical terms. Above all, as Helena Hamerow has observed, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period.\" The effects persist in the 21st century as, according to a study published in March 2015, the genetic make up of British populations today shows divisions of the tribal political units of the early Anglo-Saxon period.", "questions":

It was founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, open formats that can be used on almost any computer. , Project Gutenberg reached 50,000 items in its collection. \n\nThe releases are available in plain text but, wherever possible, other formats are included, such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Plucker. Most releases are in the English language, but many non-English works are also available. There are multiple affiliated projects that are providing additional content, including regional and language-specific works. Project Gutenberg is also closely affiliated with Distributed Proofreaders, an Internet-based community for proofreading scanned texts. \n\nProject Gutenberg was started by Michael Hart in 1971 with the digitization of the United States Declaration of Independence. Hart, a student at the University of Illinois, obtained access to a Xerox Sigma V mainframe computer in the university's Materials Research Lab.

Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges. \n\nHistorically, a similar practice has also occurred in many Islamic lands. Although Islam has no codified doctrine of patronage on the part of saints, it has nevertheless been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: \"There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.\" As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, in a manner different to Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, \"patron saints\" are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the patron saint of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein. The veneration of patron saints has lessened since the eighteenth-century in certain parts of the Islamic world, due to the growing influence in those of areas of latter-day \"reformation\" movements like Salafism and Wahhabism, which shun the veneration of saints in general.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What kind of movement is Salafism?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's another one", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How do they feel about the veneration of saints?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is a patron saint?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Of what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is this in all religions?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which ones?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Does all of Islam believe this way?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where do Catholics believe saints have transcended to?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What parts of Islam include patron saints/", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What do some saints do in Islam?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "For who?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1597, "span_end": 1659, "span_text": "latter-day \"reformation\" movements like Salafism and Wahhabism", "input_text": "latter-day \"reformation\" movement", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1597, "span_end": 1659, "span_text": "latter-day \"reformation\" movements like Salafism and Wahhabism", "input_text": "Wahhabism", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1637, "span_end": 1707, "span_text": "Salafism and Wahhabism, which shun the veneration of saints in general", "input_text": "they shun them", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 208, "span_text": "A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or particular branches of Islam, is regarded as the heavenly advocate ", "input_text": "a heavenly advocate", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 199, "span_end": 274, "span_text": "advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person", "input_text": "a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 72, "span_end": 169, "span_text": "a saint who in Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or particular branches of Islam", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 72, "span_end": 169, "span_text": "a saint who in Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or particular branches of Islam", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 71, "span_end": 169, "span_text": " a saint who in Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or particular branches of Islam", "input_text": "Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Islam", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 138, "span_end": 169, "span_text": "or particular branches of Islam", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 276, "span_end": 360, "span_text": "Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical", "input_text": "the metaphysical", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 608, "span_end": 671, "span_text": "been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition", "input_text": "Sunni and Shia", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 677, "span_end": 754, "span_text": "particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates", "input_text": "serve as heavenly advocates", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 709, "span_end": 820, "span_text": " saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages", "input_text": "Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "Patron_saint.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3x08e93bhvinx8aw2yqh7sp0bvr66l", "filename": "high16384.txt", "story": "Going green is something that affects every single one of us.

So far as they could judge, there was only one pair of oars making the splashes that had aroused them; but they could hear the blades dig deep into the water with an intense effort that could mean only haste on the part of the boatsman. \n\nThey waited; and presently the small boat appeared in the moonlight and they saw a single figure, who dropped one oar and crossed himself religiously. \n\n\"_Gracias a Dios!_\" he said. \n\n\"The pilot!\" Macallister gasped. \n\nGrahame waited, tense and alert, until the pilot climbed on board. The instant the half-breed touched the deck he began gesticulating wildly and talking so rapidly that Grahame had difficulty in grasping his meaning. Miguel, who was more at home in the peon Spanish, explained--in English, for Macallister's sake. \n\n\"The government men catch him; make him tell; he escape; take short path--Indian _senda_; get here first. _Soldados_ coming. We hurry!\" \n\nMiguel had worked himself up to a state of great excitement, and when he finished, his bare feet went pattering off across the deck almost before Grahame could give the order. \n\nTired as the men were, they realized the necessity for haste, and they lost no time in getting under way.

Some, however, he could not see, because they sat back in the gloom. \n\nThen he glanced at his companions. He was nervous, but Mabel was marked by her serene calm. Flora's look was rather fixed, and although she had not much color, her pose was resolute and proud. Marston wondered whether she felt she was making something of a plunge; but if she did so, he knew she would not hesitate. Chisholm's face was quiet and perhaps a trifle stern; he looked rather old, and Marston imagined him resigned. The Commodore was frank; one generally knew what he felt. All three looked typically English, but Wyndham did not. Although his eyes were very blue and his hair was touched by red, he was different from the others. His face, as Marston saw it in profile, was thin and in a way ascetic, but it wore a stamp of recklessness. His pose was strangely alert and highly strung. There was something exotic about him.

He was injured, but authorities were questioning him, one source said. Sources told CNN he was taken into custody in South Waziristan province and had since been moved. \n\nBut the Pakistani Taliban told CNN the report was baseless and that Rashid is in a safe area. \n\nAuthorities have said Rashid is responsible for several large prison breaks in Pakistan. In 2004, he was sentenced to death for planning an attack on former President Gen.

It so seldom happens that young ladies on the eve of their marriage have their future husbands living near them. This happiness was hers, and Mr Oriel made the most of it. She was constantly being coaxed down to the parsonage by Patience, in order that she might give her opinion, in private, as to some domestic arrangement, some piece of furniture, or some new carpet; but this privacy was always invaded. What Mr Oriel's parishioners did in these halcyon days, I will not ask. His morning services, however, had been altogether given up, and he had provided himself with a very excellent curate. \n\nBut one grief did weigh heavily on Beatrice. She continually heard her mother say things which made her feel that it would be more than ever impossible that Mary should be at her wedding; and yet she had promised her brother to ask her.

Jiang also accused the anti-GM lobby of repeatedly using outdated or inaccurate data to support an \"incorrect\" stance. \n\nChen Yunfa, an independent researcher into the Yangtze River Delta economy, recently wrote a commentary on the Internet news portal Eastday in which he criticized the actions of the 61 scientists, saying they had gone \"beyond their proper duty\". He suggested that large multinational corporations might be behind the letter and similar incidents, prompted by a desire to freeze China's patent hybrid rice technology out of the market. \n\nTo support his contentions, Chen said that GM rice, first produced by scientists in the US, still hasn't gained official approval from the US government. However, the US authorities have actually granted licenses to six varieties of GM rice. The commercial planting of two varieties - anti-herbicide (BAR) transgenic rice LL RICE 06 and LL RICE 62 - produced by the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, was approved in 1999 and a license for cultivation for edible use was granted in 2000. \n\nThe public outcry for GM labeling and boycotting has hindered the advancement of the technology. Concern about GM foods has been fueled by studies like the one published by French professor Gilles-Eric Seralini in September 2012. Seralini claimed that his research involving rats proved that the GM corn fed to them caused tumor growth. Furthermore, there is growing concern that the pesticides used on GMOs are contributing to the decline of the world's honey bee population, leading to honey bee deaths by infecting the brains of the insects with toxins. Therefore, some experts recommend the labeling of non-GM foods so that consumers can make that decision without a regulatory burden being placed on GMOs. \n\nHowever, we should be cautious about anything that may risk humans' life.

The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics. \n\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships.

My confidence is really high at the moment and I feel great to play against Novak. I know it's going to be tough; he's been the best player this year. It will be a great experience,\" Lopez said, AFP reported. \n\nMeanwhile, at the Estoril Open in Portugal, Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro defeated Pablo Cuevas 6-2 7-6 (8-6) in Saturday's semifinal. \n\nDel Potro took one hour and 49 minutes to overcome the Uruguayan breaking Cuevas's serve in the first game helping him establish an 4-2 lead when rain intervened.

They sniffed around the edges of the yard and found some old watermelon. That's a good snack for young dogs like Ginger and Joey! Next, they rolled around in the dirt. Then they chased their tails. Finally, their mom came out and told them to come inside. They were so dirty, they needed a bath. Ginger loved baths and jumped right into the tub. Joey was scared and ran away to hide.

He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time. \n\nOne day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. \"No more sewing, Mary!\" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy.

Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. \n\nThe latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. \n\nThe workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. \n\nThey did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. \n\nOne hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. \n\nThe released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. \n\nThe four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. \n\nAbout 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. \n\nA top Caterpillar executive called the hostage-taking unhelpful. \n\n\"The actions that are taking place today, led by a small minority of individuals, are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation,\" said Chris Schena, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, in a statement.

The animal, called Mrs T, was facing a terrible future after losing her two front legs in a mouse attack while she was sleeping in winter, but her owners glued the wheels onto her shell . \"She's going double the speed she used to,\" said the owner Jude Ryder, \"She uses her back legs to push herself along and seems quite happy.\" The 58-year-old owner was surprised when she went to check on her loved pet last month and found her front legs had been eaten in the mouse attack. The local animal doctor tried his best to save Mrs T. But he was afraid that the tortoise would not survive without being mobile. After paying PS1,000 for the treatment, Mrs Ryder turned to her son Dale for help. Dale designed the front wheels and used resin to add them to the front of the shell. Mrs Ryder said: \"She liked them immediately, but she must learn how to turn and stop. She can get a good speed up, much faster than before. Mrs T is still quite young for a tortoise. She could go on for another 50 years. All she needs is a new set of tyres sometimes.\" When Mrs T was sixty years old, she was bought as a pet for Dale, an 8-year-old boy. It liked running happily in Mrs Ryder's garden in spring and summer. When winter came, Mrs T slept in the garden shelter. A mouse got in last month and chewed off both her front legs. Mrs Ryder said: \"We were afraid she would be sure to die, but her new set of wheels have saved her life.

Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers. \n\nPlutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of Chaeronea, about 80\u00a0km (50 miles) east of Delphi, in the Greek region of Boeotia. His family was wealthy. The name of Plutarch's father has not been preserved, but based on the common Greek custom of repeating a name in alternate generations, it was probably Nikarchus (). The name of Plutarch's grandfather was Lamprias, as he attested in \"Moralia\" and in his \"Life of Antony\". \n\nHis brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms. Rualdus, in his 1624 work \"Life of Plutarchus\", recovered the name of Plutarch's wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence afforded by his writings. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother.

Since the acquisition of Reuters Group by the Thomson Corporation in 2008, the Reuters news agency has been a part of Thomson Reuters, making up the media division. Reuters transmits news in English, French, Arabic, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Urdu, and Chinese. It was established in 1851. \n\nThe Reuter agency was established in 1851 by Paul Julius Reuter in Britain at the London Royal Exchange. Paul Reuter worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to Reuter, who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen. \n\nUpon moving to England, he founded Reuter's Telegram Company in 1851. Headquartered in London, the company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London \"Morning Advertiser\" in 1858. Afterwards more newspapers signed up, with \"Britannica Encyclopedia\" writing that \"the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance.\" Reuter's agency built a reputation in Europe and the rest of the world as the first to report news scoops from abroad. Reuters was the first to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in Europe, for instance, in 1865. In 1872, Reuters expanded into the far east, followed by South America in 1874. Both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables.

Another possibility, put forward by Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993, is that it comes from the Biak phrase \"sup i papwa\" which means 'the land below [the sunset]' and refers to the islands west of the Bird's Head, as far as Halmahera.

Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8\u00a0million (2.6\u00a0million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3\u00a0million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger. \n\nApart from being regarded as the \"City of Music\" because of its musical legacy, Vienna is also said to be \"The City of Dreams\" because it was home to the world's first psycho-analyst \u2013 Sigmund Freud.

is a that of Father Christmas, or Santa Claus. According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions. \n\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night! Some children can become very worried about this idea and fear that he is a kind of burglar. \n\nMost children, however, understand from their parents and from the media that Father Christmas is basically a _ character, and look forward to his annual visit with joy and excitement.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How did the legend of Santa Claus start?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How does he get into people's houses?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did Nicholas live?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Why did he want to help the poor girls?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the theory of why children like Santa Claus so much?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What makes him so ideal?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Do all children feel that way about him?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Why would they be frightened?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did Nicholas drop down the chimneys?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did he tell anyone that he was doing this?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 540, "span_end": 569, "span_text": "a Christian bishop in Turkey ", "input_text": "a Christian bishop in Turkey", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 471, "span_text": "Nicholas", "input_text": "Nicholas", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 797, "span_end": 813, "span_text": "down the chimney", "input_text": "down the chimney", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 578, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "285--350 A.D", "input_text": "285--350 A.D.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 708, "span_end": 753, "span_text": "To provide them with money for their weddings", "input_text": "to provide them with money so they could get married", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1318, "span_end": 1344, "span_text": "he is like an ideal father", "input_text": "he is like an ideal father", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1346, "span_end": 1417, "span_text": "he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them", "input_text": "he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them and is never angry", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1586, "span_end": 1599, "span_text": "some children", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1552, "span_end": 1599, "span_text": "can be a frightening character to some children", "input_text": "he can be frightening to some children", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1960, "span_end": 1993, "span_text": "fear that he is a kind of burglar", "input_text": "they may think he is a burglar", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 797, "span_text": "gold coins ", "input_text": "gold coins", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 764, "span_end": 772, "span_text": "secretly", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "high8556.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3maod8e57qa8n80k22lo9go63m3nxo", "filename": "Korean_WarKorean_War_791e4581e0bd0c35746c1cf4cb6bda8f5ac764c42f822a33371429e9", "story": "The Korean War (in South Korean Hangul: \ud55c\uad6d\uc804\uc7c1, Hanja: \u97d3\u570b\u6230\u722d, Hanguk Jeonjaeng, \"Korean War\"; in North Korean Chosungul: \uc870\uad6d\ud574\ubc29\uc804\uc7c1, Joguk Haebang Jeonjaeng, \"Fatherland Liberation War\"; 25 June 1950 \u2013 27 July 1953)[a] was started when North Korea invaded South Korea.

Gaines Award for Literary Excellence. He is a 2010 Guggenheim Award winner and an assistant professor at Columbia University's School of the Arts. About \"Long Distance\" he says: \"This essay actually came about when I was asked to write about my life after having lost a great deal of weight. And yet, when I sat down to work, all I could do was return to that time when I was much heavier and deeply unhappy. Why? I sure didn't miss those days. And yet, I felt I couldn't write about my present without touching on that past. But, of course, I never reach the true present in the essay. Maybe I still don't know how to talk about a life with greater happiness. \" BRIDGET POTTER was born in Brompton-on-Swale, Yorkshire, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1958.

More if there's significant skin involved -- and he's happy to show us his wurst. \n\nCohen seems to believe that prudery is the enemy. Certainly, bad taste is his Trojan horse. An early montage of romantic coupling, Bruno-style, is enough to get tongues wagging -- or clucking in disapproval. It's the closest thing to gay porn most heterosexuals will see this side of \"300.\" \n\nEither way, Cohen's laughing: Properly managed, outrage is a useful marketing tool, as \"Borat\" showed. \n\nApparently permanently airbrushed right down to his backside, Bruno looks nothing like his hirsute Kazakh cousin, but the men share an ego; they're equally insensitive to other people and oblivious to notions of social decorum and the politically correct. \n\nAnd they both invest heavily in the American Dream. Bruno hungers after fame as hungrily as Borat lusted for Pamela Anderson. \n\nAfter a brief prologue in Europe -- and the distressing revelation of the vacuity of the fashion scene -- he sets out for Los Angeles, determined to become Austria's \"biggest superstar since Hitler.\" \n\nPerhaps inspired by another Cohen creation, Ali G, he sets out to make a celebrity interview show -- but sadly, the only dupes ignorant enough to participate are \"American Idol\" judges (Paula Abdul chats about her philanthropic pursuits while perched on the back of an immigrant laborer) and presidential candidates (take a bow, Ron Paul).

At age one, the Boston-bom teacher's son dragged around a stuffed rabbit that had been lovingly sewn by one of his mother's students. True, one of the ears was sewn on backward, but that just added to its magic. \"It was always special to me,\" Kalin remembers of his first handmade craft . \n\nKalin's appreciation for the simple and the simply eccentric inspired him to create etsy. com, an online craft fair, probably the largest market for handmade goods in the world. Last year, 350,000 woodworkers and other craftsmen sold their one-of-a-kind crafts on the four-year-old site. \n\nThey sell everything from hand-knit sleeves for Macbooks ($32) to myrtle-wood electric guitars ($3,200). And in an age of chain stores, it seems there's still a big market. More than three million consumers in 150 countries purchased about $87.5 million worth of crafts on Etsy last year. \n\nEmily Worden, founder of Elemental Threads, a custom handbag and jewelry company, signed up with Etsy when she started her company two years ago. She pays Etsy a 20-cent standard fee for each item she lists on the site, plus a 3.5 percent commission on everything sold.

For this trick he would need three things. First, he needed four cups each a different color. The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white. He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for. He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball. He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast. Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket. Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket. To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left. Each brother got to look under a cup.

The children would say, \"I will keep mine the longest.\" John usually slept with his next to his pillow. This year John was overjoyed by the Christmas season. He was becoming a man and stronger and soon he would be old enough to leave. He would save his orange until his birthday in July. Christmas day finally came. The children were so excited as they entered the big dinning hall. Immediately the master shouted, \"John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year.\" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. \"Here John,\" she said, \"this is for you.\" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered and then he realized what they had done.

In the past the term \"insect\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. \n\nLike several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology. \n\nAt some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth. \n\nEntomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping), but scientific study began only as recently as the 16th century. \n\nWilliam Kirby is widely considered as the father of Entomology.

It's likely having a best girlfriend, Buckley says - \"Somebody they can relate to, they have something in common with.\" \n\nDebbie has Ronnie. Misty can't live without Dulary. _ But perhaps the closest friends of all are Tarra and Bella. Tarra, an 8,700 pound Asian elephant; Bella, a stray dog, are closest friends. \n\nBella is one of more than a dozen stray dogs that have found a home at the sanctuary. Most want nothing to do with the elephants and vice versa. But not this odd couple. \"Bella knows she's not an elephant. Tarra knows she's not a dog,\" Buckley adds. \"But that's not a problem for them.\" \"When it's time to eat they both eat together. They drink together. They sleep together. They play together,\" Buckley says. \n\nTarra and Bella have been close for years -- but no one really knew how close they were until recently. A few months ago Bella suffered a spinal cord injury. She couldn't move her legs, couldn't even wag her tail. For three weeks the dog lay motionless up in the sanctuary office. And for three weeks the elephant held vigil: 2,700 acres to roam free, and Tarra just stood in the corner, beside a gate, right outside that sanctuary office. \"She just stood outside the balcony - just stood there and waited,\" says Buckley. \"She was concerned about her friend.\" Then one day, sanctuary co-founder Scott Blais carried Bella onto the balcony so she and Tarra could at least see each other. \n\n\"Bella's tail started wagging. And we had no choice but to bring Bella down to see Tarra,\" Blais says. \n\nThey visited like that every day until Bella could walk. Today, their love -- and trust -- is stronger than ever. Bella even lets Tarra pet her tummy - with the bottom of her enormous foot. They harbor no fears, no secrets, no prejudices. Just two living creatures who somehow managed to look past their immense differences. \n\nTake a good look at this couple, human beings. Take a good look at the world.

Its capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca. Other major cities include Marrakesh, Tangier, Sal\u00e9, Fes, and Meknes. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and Northwestern Africa. Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North African country to avoid Ottoman occupation.

There was no treatment for the disease. About twenty years later, the disease also began to attack the son. Woody's health got worse and worse, and finally he entered a hospital. \n\nWhile Woody seemed to be forgotten, his music was not. By the late 1950s, folk music became popular in America. More Americans began listening and playing the songs of Woody Guthrie. Young folk singers came to New York to visit Woody in the hospital. Among them was Bob Dylan, one of America's greatest popular songwriters. He called Woody his hero. Dylan and others copied the way Woody sang and played the guitar. And like Woody, they wrote songs that called for social and political justice . \n\nWoody Guthrie stayed in the hospital until he died in 1967. In the last years of his life, Woody could hardly speak. But his family and friends knew he still believed in the causes he had sung and written about all his life.

Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. \n\nSeveral yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. \n\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No! Not you!\" his girlfriend screamed after him. \n\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. \n\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. \n\nJane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. \n\nPolice and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer.

Internet search engines at that time were slow and gave many websites that weren't useful. In January 1996, Page and Brin decided to make a better and faster search engine.

The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade.

Of the servants, James and his wife were the only ones in authority, and they were the tools of de Cartienne. \n\nThe latter I could not quite understand. The only thing about him perfectly clear was that he was just the worst companion possible for Silchester. For the rest, he was so clever that his presence here at all as a pupil seemed unnecessary. He appeared to be rich and he took a deep interest of some sort in Cecil. Seemingly it was a friendly interest, but of that I did not feel assured.

I must have time and opportunity. Any violent measures in such a case would be worse than useless.

Then came the evening with all its crash and glare; the banquet, the opera, and the ball. \n\nThe Duke of St. James took the oaths and his seat. He was introduced by Lord Fitz-pompey. He heard a debate. We laugh at such a thing, especially in the Upper House; but, on the whole, the affair is imposing, particularly if we take part in it. Lord Ex-Chamberlain thought the nation going on wrong, and he made a speech full of currency and constitution. Baron Deprivyseal seconded him with great effect, brief but bitter, satirical and sore. The Earl of Quarterday answered these, full of confidence in the nation and in himself. When the debate was getting heavy, Lord Snap jumped up to give them something light. The Lords do not encourage wit, and so are obliged to put up with pertness. But Viscount Memoir was very statesmanlike, and spouted a sort of universal history. Then there was Lord Ego, who vindicated his character, when nobody knew he had one, and explained his motives, because his auditors could not understand his acts. Then there was a maiden speech, so inaudible that it was doubted whether, after all, the young orator really did lose his virginity. In the end, up started the Premier, who, having nothing to say, was manly, and candid, and liberal; gave credit to his adversaries and took credit to himself, and then the motion was withdrawn.

On the other side, the Welsh hills rose against the sunset in a smooth black line. \n\nMarston felt pleasantly languid and altogether satisfied. Mabel had put a cushion under his head and given him a footstool. It was soothing to be taken care of by one whom one loved, and after the glare of the Caribbean and the gloom of the swamps, the soft colors and changing lights of the English landscape rested his eyes. For all that, they did not wander long from Mabel, who sat close by, quietly pondering. With her yellow hair and delicate pink skin she looked very English, and all that was English had an extra charm for Marston. He liked her thoughtful calm. Mabel was normal; she, so to speak, walked in the light, and the extravagant imaginings he had indulged at the lagoon vanished when she was about. \n\nYet he had been forced to remember much, for Chisholm and Flora had come to hear his story, and he had felt he must make them understand in order to do his comrade justice.

I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock _regardant_ on a dunghill _or_, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What month was that?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was the atmosphere?", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Where are the boys?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How was there behavior?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many people were outside?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where the sound came from?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How was the sound?", "turn_id": 7, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Who did the narrator inquire about it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which classroom he said folks cleaning out?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who showed up right at that time?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was he hurt?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was he holding that?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was there blood?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What descent he was from?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Was Smithums amused about it?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who opened the door?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Was it a pleasant sight?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What historical event did he compare it to?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How old was Guy Heavystone then?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 60, "span_end": 105, "span_text": "A Dingy, swashy, splashy afternoon in October", "input_text": "October", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 60, "span_end": 105, "span_text": "A Dingy, swashy, splashy afternoon in October", "input_text": "wet", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 106, "span_end": 154, "span_text": " a school-yard filled with a mob of riotous boys", "input_text": "in a school-yard", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 188, "span_end": 245, "span_text": "Suddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the schoolroom.", "input_text": "bad", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 156, "span_end": 186, "span_text": "A lot of us standing outside.

Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning \"red people\". It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union.

The reunion was brought about by Teresa Micco, a Southern California veterinarian who mistook Nigel, an African gray parrot, for her own missing bird, the Daily Breeze reported on Sunday. Teresa Micco tracked Nigel's microchip to Darren Chick, a British man who lives in Torrance, California. \"I introduced myself and said, 'Have you lost a bird?' \"Micco told the newspaper. \"He first said, 'No' But he thought I meant recently \" When she checked on Chick's name and said she had his African gray parrot, \"He looked at me like I was crazy. \" He said his bird had gone missing for four years earlier. Little is known about Nigel's whereabouts for the past four years, but Chick says the bird's British accent is gone, and it now chatters in Spanish. Chick says last week's reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes---despite the fact that Nigel bit him when he first tried to pick him up. Micco said the behaviour was not unusual and that Nigel would settle back in soon enough. \"He is doing very well,\" Chick told the newspaper. \"It is really strange. I knew it was him from the minute I saw him\" It is the fifth parrot reunion helped by Micco, who has been running advertisements for her own missing bird for nine months. That parrot, Benjamin, escaped in February when it flew out through a door that had been left open. Julissa Sperling found Nigel outside her home and brought him to Micco after seeing one of her advertisements. \"He was the happiest bird.

Suddenly it was announced that the \"empty\" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it. The plants would be removed, the animals would run away and most would probably die. Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds. When he heard about the news, he was not happy. He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted. Andrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area, and how the houses would affect the local environment. He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters. He also called on his neighbors to _ the building of the houses. Although he was only 12 years old, he had the courage and wisdom of a person much older. Andrew' s teachers described him as gentle, shy and active. His classmates also admired how much he knew about local animals and plants,and the environment.Each day after school, Andrew went door-to-door, to ask the people to sign, who did not want the houses to be built. In only one month, he got the signatures of 250 people. In the end, the land remained a safe place for birds, animals and plants that belonged there.

It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many. \n\nJo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving. \n\nAll the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.
