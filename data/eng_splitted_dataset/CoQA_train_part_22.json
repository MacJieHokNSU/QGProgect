In contrast, (\"in fact\" or \"in practice\") describes situations that are generally known to exist in reality, even if not legally authorized. The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios, for example, \"I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it\u2019s a de facto swimming pool\". \n\nIt is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (\"de jure\") legalities, possibly none of which is in force (\"de facto\"). After seizing power in 1526, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi made his brother, Umar Din, the lawful (\"de jure\") Sultan of Adal. Ahmad, however, was in practice (\"de facto\") the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead. Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt ruled as \"de jure\" viceroys of the Ottoman Empire, but acted as \"de facto\" independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, from about 1882, the rulers had only \"de jure\" rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state. Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law \"de jure\" a province of the Ottoman Empire, but \"de facto\" was part of the British Empire.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the topic of conversation?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is there a specific practice?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was Adal's Sultan?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was in practice?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When did Egypt rule?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What law did they fall under?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is de jure and de facto used to contrast?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What relationship did Egypt have with Britain?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And what was it referred to around 1882?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Can you have more than one conflict at once?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 21, "span_end": 30, "span_text": ", de jure", "input_text": "Different kinds of laws", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 22, "span_end": 30, "span_text": " de jure", "input_text": "de jure", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 680, "span_end": 688, "span_text": "Umar Din", "input_text": "Umar Din", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 729, "span_end": 735, "span_text": "Ahmad,", "input_text": "Ahmad,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 834, "span_end": 848, "span_text": " 1805 and 1914", "input_text": "Between 1805 and 1914", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 888, "span_end": 895, "span_text": "de jure", "input_text": "de jure", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 163, "span_end": 174, "span_text": " situations", "input_text": "situations", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1229, "span_end": 1237, "span_text": "de facto", "input_text": "de facto", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1124, "span_end": 1147, "span_text": " a British puppet state", "input_text": "a British puppet state", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 476, "span_end": 555, "span_text": "It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (\"de jure\") legalities", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "De_jure.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3tesa3pj31arbeggcu4flkj8r3smm8", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Harold Bindloss___The Intriguers.txt/CHAPTER XIX_272bdd86b2d8c4d4905c795f6be98b3e850b6ee8629e6a3d10152fb", "story": "CHAPTER XIX \n\nTHE DESERTED TEPEES \n\nStarting at daybreak, they reached a hillside overlooking the Stony village on the third afternoon.

The neighborhood is a workingclass community. People do not have very much money, and they have limited access to fresh food in markets. \n\nOver the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Her son Alston Clark thinks his experience is very valuable. \"I like coming out here,\" he says, \"You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more.\" \n\nMargaret Morgan started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. \"Growing food in a community brings people together,\" she continues, \"Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration to show people everything about how to have an ecofriendly community.\" she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost made from food waste. \n\nEco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks, but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the green houses use a geothermal system. \n\nVegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bike to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest. \n\n\"I like eating the vegetables,\" says fiveyearold Owen Moss.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who started Eco City Farms?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Does she think people can learn to live better there?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where does the farm get it's electricity?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How long is the growing season at the farm?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which neighbor's go weekly in winter?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How do they get there?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Does Owen like veggies?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What city is the farm in?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is that in Vermont?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What's it near?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What kind of place is it?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Do people have much money in the community?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Do they attract volunteers?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Like who?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Does she have kids?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Do they attend public school?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Where do they get their education?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What's Marcy's son's name?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 737, "span_end": 752, "span_text": "Margaret Morgan", "input_text": "Margaret Morgan", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 777, "span_end": 851, "span_text": "She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1338, "span_end": 1351, "span_text": " from the sun", "input_text": "from the sun", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1449, "span_end": 1458, "span_text": " all year", "input_text": "all year", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1508, "span_end": 1541, "span_text": "Chris Moss and her three children", "input_text": "Chris Moss and her three children", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1542, "span_end": 1546, "span_text": "bike", "input_text": "bicycling", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1596, "span_end": 1625, "span_text": "\"I like eating the vegetables", "input_text": "Yres", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 106, "span_end": 116, "span_text": " Edmonston", "input_text": "Edmonston", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 116, "span_end": 125, "span_text": ",Maryland", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 117, "span_end": 125, "span_text": "Maryland", "input_text": "Maryland", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 143, "span_end": 188, "span_text": "shopping centers, car repair shops and homes.", "input_text": "shopping centers, car repair shops and homes.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 796, "span_end": 851, "span_text": " a place where people can learn to live healthier lives", "input_text": "a place where people can learn to live healthier lives", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 235, "span_end": 267, "span_text": "People do not have very much mon", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 362, "span_end": 386, "span_text": "has attracted volunteers", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 411, "span_end": 421, "span_text": "Marcy Clar", "input_text": "Marcy Clark", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 528, "span_end": 548, "span_text": "Her son Alston Clark", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 439, "span_end": 444, "span_text": " four", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 424, "span_end": 461, "span_text": "She schools her four children at home", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 454, "span_end": 461, "span_text": "at home", "input_text": "at home", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 536, "span_end": 549, "span_text": "Alston Clark ", "input_text": "Alston Clark", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high7608.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3r8yzbnq9hizbq7l0h97jb6n58kq7z", "filename": "mc500.test.3", "story": "Jamie was on the playground.

This afternoon, the water was shallow enough at low tide that McClure could easily walk 100 yards offshore and cast his line in any direction. \n\nNear sunset, still without a fish, he decided to turn back. Rather than turn to his earlier course, he chose a more direct path toward shore, thinking the bay wouldn't get deeper along the way. Instead, he was trapped.

Instead, they pulled him completely below the surface. \n\nBack onshore, Eliza Cameron, 19, Loren Niurka Mora, 20, and Caitlin Petro, 20, had been watching McClure fish as they rested on the grass after a long week of classes. They saw McClure go under and then heard him cry, \"Help!\" \n\nThe three friends kicked off their shoes and ran into the bay. They were all good swimmers, but all hid a fear that he might pull them down too because they'd have to dive to save him. \n\nWhen they reached him, he'd managed to kick himself out of the waders, but his eyes had partly rolled back.

He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too. \n\nWhile Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table. \n\nJacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. \"What a peaceful group,\" she thought.

It was on the banks of the Rhine. Frederic's title, as ruler of this country, was Elector Palatine. There are a great many independent states in Germany, whose sovereigns have various titles, and are possessed of various prerogatives and powers. \n\nNow it happened that, at this time, very fierce civil wars were raging between the Catholics and the Protestants in Germany. Frederic got drawn into these wars on the Protestant side. His motive was not any desire to promote the progress of what he considered the true faith, but only a wish to extend his own dominions, and add to his own power, for he had been promised a kingdom, in addition to his Palatinate, if he would assist the people of the kingdom to gain the victory over their Catholic foes. He embarked in this enterprise without consulting with James, his father-in-law, knowing that he would probably disapprove of such dangerous ambition. James was, in fact, very sorry afterward to hear of Frederic's having engaged in such a contest.

Faint mist obscured the horizon and the yachts engaged in the fifty-mile race had vanished, although Wyndham thought he had not long since distinguished a sail in the distance. He was curious about this because if he had seen canvas it was _Deva_'s, and her skipper had probably seen _Red Rose_. The rest of the fleet was scattered about to the north. Wyndham had noted their positions carefully before the haze rolled up. He wanted to win and meant to leave nothing to chance. \n\nIn the meantime, the yacht crept slowly through the sparkling water, close-hauled to a light wind that Wyndham knew would not last. Her canvas, tapering in a tall white pyramid, swayed with a regular heave against the sky. In her shadow, the sea was a cool, luminous green, but the sun was hot and Wyndham had taken off his coat. He wore a white jersey, blue trousers, and very neat white shoes. His age was twenty-six, his figure was thin but athletic, and the molding of his face was good. On the whole, he was a handsome man and was generally marked by a careless, twinkling smile. The smile, however, was to some extent deceptive, and at times his blue eyes were hard. Wyndham was popular; he had a way of inspiring confidence, and knew and used his talent. \n\nMarston, who sat on the yacht's coaming, splicing a rope, trusted Wyndham far. Marston's round face was burned red and generally wore a look of tranquil good-humor; his mouth was large and his eyes were calm. People thought him dull and he was not clever, but Wyndham knew his comrade's stability. Although Bob was honest and trustful, he was firm. It was characteristic that the splice he slowly made was very neat.

It's a nostalgic love letter to New York of the late '30s, a novel of manners with lofty aspirations that evokes some of the classics of American literature. \n\nThe story unfolds largely in flashback, set on New Year's Eve in Manhattan 1937. The Jazz Age is over, the Depression in its final days, World War II just over the horizon. At its outset, there is a budding love triangle between Katey Kontent, that's \"kon-tent, like the state of being\"; her boardinghouse roommate, Eve; and a handsome banker, Theodore \"Tinker\" Grey, but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction. \n\nKatey is the narrator and the wry heart of this novel. She's a young woman of \"poise and purpose.\" Brooklyn-born, the daughter of immigrant laborers, she works in a Wall Street secretarial pool though aspires to much more. \n\nAlongside a supporting cast with WASPy nicknames like Dicky, Bitsy and Peaches, Katey navigates her way through Manhattan jazz clubs and Long Island cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of New York society. \n\nThe novel takes its title from young George Washington's \"Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation\"; you'll find all 110 of them in the novel's appendix. These rules are described as \"a do-it-yourself charm school.

From that time on, his family were no longer accepted by their relatives and friends. These early experiences greatly influenced his writing. By the time Lu Xun arrived in Nanjing to study at a college in 1899, he already believed that Chinese government had to change and become modern. In 1902 he went to study in Japan. There he began writing articles for some Chinese student magazines. He showed a gift for writing and translating and he even wrote several books, though none was popular. He returned to China in 1909 because he was in need of money. After working for a few years as a teacher in Beijing, Lu Xun again returned to writing. In 1918, he wrote his famous short story Diary of a Madman. It was the first Chinese novel using the everyday language that people spoke, which helped make it a great success. _ , together with his novel The True Story of Ah Q(1921), made Lu Xun a leading Chinese writer. Though successful, Lu Xun still worried greatly about China's future. In 1926, he moved to Shanghai and gave up writing stories. He only wrote articles which called on the people to fight against the government. For this, the government stopped him publishing any more books.

Every west- country coach brought up word of the fine condition of Crab Wilson, who had returned to his own native air for his training, and was known to be under the immediate care of Captain Barclay, the expert. On the other hand, although my uncle had not yet named his man, there was no doubt amongst the public that Jim was to be his nominee, and the report of his physique and of his performance found him many backers. On the whole, however, the betting was in favour of Wilson, for Bristol and the west country stood by him to a man, whilst London opinion was divided. Three to two were to be had on Wilson at any West End club two days before the battle. \n\nI had twice been down to Crawley to see Jim in his training quarters, where I found him undergoing the severe regimen which was usual. From early dawn until nightfall he was running, jumping, striking a bladder which swung upon a bar, or sparring with his formidable trainer.

What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a kilometer of beach to the island. Because Mauna Loa has erupted so often, it has become the biggest (but not the tallest) mountain in the world. These volcanoes could be dangerous to the population of Hawaii. In fact, Hilo, the second largest city in Hawaii, is built just under Mauna Loa. The volcano could erupt at any time. Most people believe that it will erupt sometime in the next twenty-five years.

After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed.

I have not any copy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been able to lay my hand upon the original; but I remember that I went over the whole ground, and covered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and proofs that my study had suggested to me. It seemed to me that I was not merely restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place in literary history, but rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of a commonplace intrigue. I put into the letter all my enthusiasm. I put into the letter all my faith. \n\nNo sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came over me. It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for belief in the Willie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had gone out of me, as it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject. What was it that had happened? It is difficult to say. Perhaps, by finding perfect expression for a passion, I had exhausted the passion itself. Emotional forces, like the forces of physical life, have their positive limitations. Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence. Perhaps I was simply tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having burnt out, my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment. However it came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt that Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the boyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more anxious to convince others than to be himself convinced.

Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, it shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north and Turkey to the northeast. Greece consists of nine geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands (including the Dodecanese and Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length, featuring a vast number of islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres (9,573 ft). \n\nGreece has one of the longest histories of any country, and is considered the cradle of Western civilization, and as such, is the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, and Western drama, including both tragedy and comedy. Greece was first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following the war of independence.

Also came claims that an unpublished study had found that mobile phones could cause memory loss. And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones could heat the brain. \n\nFor anyone who uses a mobile phone, these are worrying times. But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scares and you hear a different story. \n\nOne of the oddest effects comes from the now famous\"memory loss\" study. Alan Preece and his colleagues at the University of Bristol placed a device that imitated the microwave radiation of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers. The volunteers were good at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen. Preece says he still can't comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end. But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive abilities. \"I'm pretty sure there is no effect on short-term memory,\" he says. \n\nAnother expert, Tattersall, remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss. One result, for instance, suggests that nerve cell synapses exposed to microwaves become more -- rather than less -- receptive to undergoing changes linked to memory formation. \n\nAn even happier outcome would be that microwaves turned out to be good for you. It sounds crazy, but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California found that mice exposed to microwaves for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours when given a cancer-causing chemical. \n\n\"If _ doesn't certainly cause cancer in animals and cells, then it probably isn't going to cause cancer in humans,\" says William.

A report on adult gap years published this year by a market research company also described the potential American market for gap years as a \"sleeping giant.\" \n\n\"A gap year is a challenge for the older individual to step out of a comfort zone and take a risk. I enjoyed that side most.\" said Dr. Sinar, who kept a daily blog about his experience. His time studying Eastern medicine \"assured the reasons I went into health care,\" said Dr. Sinar, who returned to practice medicine at his old job, although he works fewer days. \"I use those experiences to provide my patients with more care,\" he added. \"And I listen better than I did before.\" \n\nGeorge Garritan, chairman of the Department of Leadership and Human Capital Management at New York University, certainly agrees with Dr. Sinar.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

Finally his creation led to what we know is called flippers! \n\nSo you don't have to be adult to be an inventor. One thing you do need, though, is something that kids have plenty of: curiosity and imagination. Kids are known for looking at things in new and unique ways. \n\nSo what should you do if you have what is a great idea for an invention? Talk to a friend or family member about it. Get input from others about your idea. Then ask them to help you create a working model--called a prototype of your idea. \n\nOnce you have a prototype, you can test it. Sometimes your idea turns out to be not as great as you thought. At other times, though, you realize it is a good idea and your prototype can help you figure out how to make it even better. \n\nIf your idea is really a good one, an adult can help you contact companies that might be interested in it.

However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition. Schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931.

Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \"Tiffany's look\". \n\nIn more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994.

The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \"geisha trips\" to Japan.

Nothing could be more courteous than the duke's manner to his guest. He professed an almost fraternal affection for him, and handsome lodgings were assigned in the town to his thanes. A solemn court was held, at which Harold was knighted by William himself with much state and ceremonial, according to the rites of chivalry, which had then been but recently introduced, and had not as yet extended into England. There were great hunting parties in the forest, and to all outward appearance the friendship between William and Harold was of the warmest and most sincere nature. Harold himself was really gratified at the pains that William took to show the esteem in which he held him, and his thanes were all well satisfied with the attentions bestowed upon them by the Norman barons. \n\nBeorn and Wulf had nothing to do save to make friends with young Normans of their own age, to visit their castles and to join in the hunting parties.

This final war was to give thousands of colonists, including Virginia colonel George Washington, military experience which they put to use during the American Revolutionary War. \n\nBy far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what was the largest military action for the US?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "when did the series of war begin?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "which was the most important?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who did they defeat?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how long was the french and indian war?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what did this give the colonists?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "whos side was the US on at first in the war of 1812?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "how did Briti", "turn_id": 8, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "what did britian try to do to stop American growth?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how did the invasion of canada go?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "when did Britian defeat Napoleon?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 622, "span_end": 641, "span_text": "was the War of 1812", "input_text": "the War of 1812", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 67, "span_text": "Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars", "input_text": "in 1689", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 130, "span_end": 180, "span_text": " the most important of which were Queen Anne's War", "input_text": "Queen Anne's War", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 191, "span_end": 239, "span_text": "the British conquered French colony Acadia, and ", "input_text": "the French colony Acadia", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 249, "span_end": 279, "span_text": "French and Indian War (1754\u201363", "input_text": "about 9 years", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 378, "span_end": 473, "span_text": "give thousands of colonists, including Virginia colonel George Washington, military experience ", "input_text": "military experience", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 756, "span_end": 798, "span_text": "The United States sought to remain neutral", "input_text": "at first neutral", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 702, "span_end": 754, "span_text": "its policy was to block American shipments to France", "input_text": "to block American shipments to France", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1373, "span_end": 1409, "span_text": "The invasion of Canada was a debacle", "input_text": "it was a debacle", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1534, "span_end": 1566, "span_text": "After defeating Napoleon in 1814", "input_text": "1814", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Military_history_of_the_United_StatesMilitary_history_of_the_United_States_e1fa2b63bce6a2875817e1c334c8c0b8b81619cd54d97c02a97d202c"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3ovr4i9uspj2s3p2yjb0gzmdfbdq49", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Phillips Oppenheim___Havoc.txt/CHAPTER XXXI_2cc5858c04f8efd5d80c2c2071d1bbac7e8ac4717eb90711d2d9952", "story": "CHAPTER XXXI \n\nMISS LENEVEU'S MESSAGE \n\nThe two men stepped back into the hotel.

She was an unwanted child whose parents never married. She was brought up on her grandmother's farm. The possibility that she would become rich and famous was slim. \n\nOprah's mother left her child in her mother's care, so she could go to work in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was a strict and difficult life for Oprah. But it also led the way for her future. \n\nShe was a highly intelligent child. By the age of three, she had learned to read and write. She also made her first public appearance at that age. Oprah's intelligence was resented by other children of her age. They called her unkind names and pushed her away. Oprah felt very isolated and unwanted. It made her feel worse that she didn't live with her mother and father. She felt that no one loved her. This made her angry and rebellious . These feelings brought her much trouble as she was growing up. She often behaved badly, causing her grandmother to punish her. By the age of seven, she was too much for her grandmother to discipline. \n\nThen Oprah went to live with her mother, Vernita, who worked very hard as a housekeeper in Milwaukee. It was hard for her to work and take care of her bright, troublesome child. They lived in poverty in a small apartment. Oprah took out all her angry feelings on her mother. When Oprah was eight, Vernita sent her to live with her father and stepmother in Nashville, Tennessee. \n\nBut she moved again a few months later when Vernita married a man with two children. Vernita wanted Oprah to be with her and her new family. Unfortunately, she felt she didn't belong with them. She believed she wasn't loved by anyone. Her angry and frustration grew stronger. She struck back by misbehaving and running away from home. Her parents found her impossible to discipline. When she was 14, they tried to send her to a special center for troubled girls. \n\nBut there was no room for her. So Vernita sent Oprah back to live with her father. Vernon Winfrey was by then a successful businessman and family man. He took one look at his daughter and knew she needed love, guidance and discipline. He gave her all three. It was a turning point in Oprah's life. He was strict about his daughter's education. \n\nHe gave her homework in addition to her schoolwork. She was allowed to watch only one hour of television a day. She became an A student and a popular girl in her class. Oprah watched Barbara Walters, a famous journalist, and decided that was what she wanted to be. \n\nWhen she was still in high school, she got a part-time job reading news on the radio. In her senior year she won a beauty contest and a four-year scholarship to Tennessee State University. \n\nWhile still in college she was offered a job as a news broadcaster at a local television station. She was the first female and the first African-American newscaster in Nashville. She was promoted to anchor, the most important position on the news team, while still a senior. \n\nAfter Oprah graduated she got a job with a Baltimore news station. But she soon realized that broadcasting news wasn't enough for her. She had to let her personality shine through. She wanted to show emotion when she told a story, not just report it. Meanwhile the station managers were thinking the same way. They removed her from the anchor spot and wondered what to do with her. Finally they put her on an early morning talk show called People Are Talking. No one knew what to expect. The show was a great success. In a very short time, the managers and Oprah all knew what she was born to do. She was everything a talk show host should be. \n\nShe was so successful that she got a show with a bigger station in Chicago. In 1985 the show was changed to The Oprah Winfrey Show. It was broadcast nationally and soon became the most popular talk show on television. By the age of 35, Oprah Winfrey was one of the most famous celebrities in America.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where did Oprah live during her childhood?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where did her mother work?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did she learn to do at 3 years old?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was her mother's name?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What happened after her mother married?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did she win during her 12th grade year?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "After she finished school what job did she get?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What school did she go to after her 12th grade year?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What show did she get after?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who did her mom make her move in with?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 62, "span_end": 90, "span_text": " in a small Mississippi town", "input_text": "in a small Mississippi town that is unnamed", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 338, "span_end": 358, "span_text": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "input_text": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 524, "span_end": 538, "span_text": "read and write", "input_text": "read and write", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1132, "span_end": 1139, "span_text": "Vernita", "input_text": "Vernita", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1747, "span_end": 1932, "span_text": "She struck back by misbehaving and running away from home.

It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[c] Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50\u00d7109 km). Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is \u2646, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. \n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which planet is more massive, Uranus, or Neptune?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Which one of the two is larger?", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 273, "span_end": 321, "span_text": " slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus", "input_text": "Neptune", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 306, "span_end": 391, "span_text": "ear-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune", "input_text": "Uranus", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "NeptuneNeptune_89524ae6d4ea83048c8aefa02af12fbb6c685921e413482c5a12057d"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3u8ycdagxpgltf71fioy4ww0yx8q00", "filename": "cnn_b8c388dd299f9a1810d59a7ad7824c98df4512a6.story", "story": "New York (CNN) -- A 35-year-old woman on a first date plummeted to her death early Thursday morning when she fell from the balcony of her 17th floor New York City apartment. \n\nJennifer Rosoff went outside on her balcony around 12:50 a.m. Thursday to talk and smoke a cigarette with her date when the balcony's railing broke, according to police. \n\nIt's unclear whether Rosoff leaned on the balcony, causing it to give way. \n\nShe landed on a second-story construction scaffolding of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. \n\nRosoff's employer, online advertising startup TripleLift, released a statement expressing sorrow at the news of her death. \n\n\"We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and co-worker,\" the statement said. \"Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office.\" \n\nRichard Dansereau, managing director of Stonehenge Management LLC, the company that manages the building, also released a statement. \n\n\"This is a tragedy, and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of Ms. Rosoff,\" he said. \"We are cooperating fully with the investigation into the cause of this terrible accident.\" \n\nA statement provided to CNN from the New York City Department of Buildings said the agency is investigating and issued a vacate order for all balconies in the building as a precaution. \n\nAccording to her Linkedin profile, Rosoff worked as director of sales at TripleLift for the past five months and had previously held positions at The New Yorker, Conde Nast and Cosmopolitan magazine.

Women's Sniper Training School and upon her graduation in April,she was further sent to the front.She managed to kill around 16 enemies in the first three months!Unfortunately,she was captured by the enemies and was killed on the fifth of July in 1944.Today,the street where she grew up has been renamed in her memory. \n\nAnne Frank was a Germanborn Jewish girl who was wellknown for the publication of her diary that described all her experiences when the Germans occupied Holland in World War II.Anne was born on June 12,1929 and she,along with her family,went into hiding in July 1942.Two years later,her family was captured and seven months from her arrest,Anne Frank died of illness in early March 1945. \n\nMargaret Ringenberg was born on 17 June,1921,in Indiana of America.She began her career during World War II when she became a ferry pilot for the Women Airforce Service Pilots.After that she turned a flight instructor in 1945.She even wrote her own book named Girls Can't Be Pilots.She passed away on 28 July,2008,after flying for 40,000 hours in the air. \n\nHannah Szenes was born on 17th July,1921 and was trained to parachute by the British army into Yugoslavia during World War II.This task was given in order to save the Jews of Hungary.Her secret mission was not revealed even when she was tortured following her arrest at the Hungarian border.Hannah Szenes had to brave immense tortures,yet she did not lose heart.She bravely battled it out and tried to sing to keep her spirits high!She also kept a record of events in her diary till 7th November,1944,when she was finally killed. \n\nThese names are just a few of the women who played a significant part in World War II.Their stories go a long way in showing the kind of lifestyles they led and their struggles

When the crowd aren't getting on your back you've got the players acting up or giving you an earful. \n\nSo if someone described your refereeing as \"the best,\" you could be forgiven for feeling a small surge of pride. But when the person praising you has been called the world's most notorious match fixer, then it's time to show yourself a red card. \n\nWilson Raj Perumal says he corrupted many football players and officials during a long criminal career, but there is one person who stands out from the crowd. His name was Ibrahim Chaibou, a referee from Niger. \n\n\"He was the best, he was the best, but not from FIFA's point of view,\" Perumal told CNN during a wide-ranging television interview about his match-fixing days. \n\nPerfect partner \n\nThe Singaporean, who is now helping European police with match-fixing investigations, claims to have rigged the results of up to 100 matches over a 20-year period, boasting of a 70-80% success rate. \n\nChaibou, who he describes as \"very bold,\" became one of his favourite match officials. \n\nAccording to Perumal, the referee's first match fix was an international friendly between South Africa and Guatemala in May 2010 -- one of several warm-up matches played ahead of the 2010 World Cup which the Rainbow Nation hosted. \n\nWatching highlights of the game on YouTube, Perumal gives a running commentary on the major incidents. \n\n\"It's crazy,\" Perumal says as Chaibou awards South Africa a penalty kick.

Natasha Sykes, a mother of two in Atlanta, remembers the first time her daughter, Kelsey, now 3 but then barely 2 years old, held her husband's iPhone.\"She pressed the button and it lit up.I just remember her eyes.It was like 'Whoa!' \"The parents were charmed by their daughter's fascination.But then, said Ms.Sykes (herself a Black Berry user), \"She got serious about the phone.\" Kelsey would ask for it.Then she'd cry for it.\"It was like she'd always want the phone,\" Ms.Sykes said. Apple, the iPhone's designer and manufacturer, has built its success on machines so user-friendly that even technologically blinded adults can figure out how to work them, so it makes sense that sophisticated children would follow.Tap a picture on the screen and something happens.What could be more fun? The sleepy-eyed toddler who called for the iPhone is one of hundreds of iPhone-loving toddlers whose parents are often proud of their offspring's ability to slide fat fingers across the gadget's screen and pull up photographs of their choice. Many iPhone apps on the market are aimed directly at preschoolers, many of them labeled \"educational,\" such as Toddler Teasers: Shapes, which asks the child to tap a circle or square or triangle; and Pocket Zoo, which streams live video of animals at zoos around the world. Along with fears about dropping and damage, however, many parents sharing iPhones with their young ones feel guilty.They wonder whether it is indeed an educational tool, or a passive amusement like television.The American Academy of Pediatrics is continually reassessing its guidelines to address new forms of \"screen time.\" Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe, a member of the academy's council, said, \"We always try to throw in the latest technology, but the cellphone industry is becoming so complex that we always come back to the table and wonder- Should we have a specific guideline for _ \" Tovah P. Klein, the director of a research center for Toddler Development worries that fixation on the iPhone screen every time a child is out with parents will limit the child's ability to experience the wider world. As with TV in earlier generations, the world is increasingly divided into those parents who do allow iPhone use and those who don't. A recent post on UrbanBaby.com, asked if anyone had found that their child was more interested in playing with their iPhone than with real toys. The Don't mothers said on the Website: \"We don't let our toddler touch our iPhones ... it takes away from creative play.\" \"Please ... just say no. It is not too hard to distract a toddler with, say ... a book.\" Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychology professor who specializes in early language development, sides with the Don'ts. Research shows that children learn best through activities that help them adapt to the particular situation at hand and interacting with a screen doesn't qualify, she said. Still, Dr. Hirsh-Pasek, struck on a recent visit to New York City by how many parents were handing over their iPhones to their little children in the subway, said she understands the impulse . \"This is a magical phone,\" she said. \"I must admit I'm addicted to this phone.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "what signals end of nap?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who did he reach out for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who are apps aiming for?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who is Natasha's daughter?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how old?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what about then?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is the name of the doctor mentioned?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "she's a member of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what was the recent post on?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "is there a particular phone mentione?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 4, "span_end": 43, "span_text": "bedroom door opened and a light went on", "input_text": "bedroom door opened and a light went on", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 168, "span_end": 178, "span_text": "his father", "input_text": "his father", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 381, "span_text": "1-, 2- and 3-year-olds", "input_text": "1-, 2- and 3-year-olds", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 562, "span_end": 568, "span_text": "Kelsey", "input_text": "Kelsey", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 573, "span_end": 575, "span_text": " 3", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 592, "span_end": 603, "span_text": "2 years old", "input_text": "2 years old", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 2112, "span_end": 2138, "span_text": "Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe", "input_text": "Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 2151, "span_end": 2173, "span_text": " the academy's council", "input_text": "the academy's council", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2946, "span_end": 2953, "span_text": "iPhones", "input_text": "iPhones", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high4348.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "31euonyn2v3y14v132kj0krqduaovt", "filename": "cnn_ac9054d59378a1928d2ef01a2b99f36f3a4ad584.story", "story": "So ill he could not move, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart supposedly sang parts of his final masterpiece, \"Requiem,\" from his deathbed.

I went to the show's website to see for myself. My mom was right. At a time when even Barbara Walters says she's really bored with celebrities interviews, this one will not disappoint. \n\nIt's the story of Derek Paravicini, a 30-year-old who was born three months early, physically disabled (he can't button his own shirt), blind, and severely autistic . \n\nYet, through total luck and coincidence, his family discovered that Derek had a remarkable musical talent when he was three. \n\nDerek can hear any musical composition one time and play it perfectly on the piano. \n\nThat's right. He only has to hear it once. \n\nEven more unbelievable, his brain, like a computer, can keep many songs that he can immediately repeat when asked. But his talent isn't limited to just learning things by heart. Derek is a true musical genius and artist who plays beautifully in a wide range of styles and can make his own music. \n\nWith his talent, Derek has raised millions of dollars putting on charity concerts. He also donates his time to senior centers where he acts as a human jukebox machine, taking requests from senior citizens who haven't heard their favorite songs for decades. \n\nAs it turns out, Derek loves people and his extraordinary talent has been the key to unlocking his personality and social development. \n\nIf you want to inspire your family, pop some popcorn and sit everyone down to watch this excellent piece of journalism. If your kids are like mine, it will cause a great family discussion about the definition of \"disability\" and the extraordinary ability of the human brain and spirit. It may even give you the perfect answer the next time your child says he or she \"can't\" do something.

Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers.[nb 2] The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is John's mom?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "And his dad?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What country was he from?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was he born?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What oceanic regions did Henry have?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many is that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What region did he add to that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where did his mom reign?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did she have a strong claim to Toulouse?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who was her previous husband?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where was he from?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What was created when Henry and Eleanor wed?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was Henry the Duke of Anjou?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What was he?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How did he get that title?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was the empire strong?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 9, "span_end": 61, "span_text": "born to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine", "input_text": "Eleanor of Aquitaine", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 9, "span_end": 25, "span_text": "born to Henry II", "input_text": "Henry II", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 37, "span_text": "John was born to Henry II of England ", "input_text": "England", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 62, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "on 24 December 1166", "input_text": "Dec 24 1166", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 155, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "Anjou, Normandy and England", "input_text": "Anjou, Normandy and England", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 155, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "Anjou, Normandy and England", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 207, "span_end": 229, "span_text": "by conquering Brittany", "input_text": "Brittany", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 207, "span_end": 229, "span_text": "by conquering Brittany", "input_text": "by conquering it", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 319, "span_text": " who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine", "input_text": "the Duchy of Aquitaine", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 324, "span_end": 355, "span_text": "had a tenuous claim to Toulouse", "input_text": "it was tenuous", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 409, "span_end": 448, "span_text": " the former wife of Louis VII of France", "input_text": "Louis VII", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 428, "span_end": 449, "span_text": " Louis VII of France.", "input_text": "France.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 450, "span_end": 483, "span_text": "The result was the Angevin Empire", "input_text": "the Angevin Empire", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 497, "span_end": 537, "span_text": "Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 522, "span_end": 537, "span_text": " Count of Anjou", "input_text": "Count of Anjou", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 485, "span_end": 519, "span_text": "named after Henry's paternal title", "input_text": "its his paternal title", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 588, "span_end": 631, "span_text": "The Empire, however, was inherently fragile", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 696, "span_end": 731, "span_text": "parts each had their own histories,", "input_text": "each part had a different history", "turn_id": 18}], "name": "John,_King_of_EnglandJohn,_King_of_England_d3e6df2e731539be0884ea6b07cbdfd645b9d95cb1914e4dbc3fa643"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3luy3gc63z0ebe6604uij6gd0cx7po", "filename": "mc500.train.10", "story": "Stinky Pete wanted to build a tree house.

During her mission, she did scientific experiments using the weightless atmosphere. In space, there is no gravity, so everything floats! Dr. Jemison's experiments gave important information about the human body to produce better medicines and healthcare. In 2012, Liu Yang became the first Chinese women in space.

The Asian Games are always held at the same year as the World Cup, which is also held every four years. Many people around the world pay more attention to the World Cup.

In this way, the Asian Games won't be held in the same year as the World Cup. So Hangzhou will hold the event in 2023. Hanoi , capital of Vietnam , is the host city of the 18th Asian Games. However, Vietnamese government announced in 2014 that Hanoi gave up the right to host the Asian Games because they don't have enough money. Luckily, Djakarta , capital of Indonesia , was willing to be the host city instead of Hanoi. But then came another problem. Djakarta will hold presidential election in 2019, so the government wanted to change the holding time of the Asian Games back to 2018.

Staff have been since Jackson's death as thousands of mourners visit the exhibition to pay tribute to the star. The statue has skinny cheeks and - most strikingly - a tipless nose. It is on display at the Ancient Egypt exhibition at The Field Museum in the United States. The bust was bought in Cairo in 1889 and has been on display at the museum for 21 years. But its popularity has risen rapidly since Michael Jackson's death after fans started writing about the ancient statue on internet blogs. The bust was carved during the New Kingdom Period, which ran between 1550 BC to 1050 BC. This was around the same time as famous Egyptians Ramesses and King Tut. The museum's 4,500 daily visitors are banned from touching or kissing the statue, which is protected behind a glass screen. Astonished fans stand admiring the statue and discussing its likeness with others who have travelled to see it. Darnell Williams, the director of guest relations, said some fans were treating a visit to the museum like a pilgrimage . He said: \"The statue has been here for years but interest has been raised since Michael Jackson's death. People are coming from all over the country to see the statue and compare its likeness to the king of pop. \"They want to touch and kiss the model like it is some sort of God but it is behind a screen to protect it from damage. Once people see it they are astounded and can't stop talking about its likeness. It really is remarkable.\" James Phillips, manager of near east and north African exhibits, said little was known about the origins of the model. He said: \"The likeness is astonishing but I think it is probably a coincidence. We do not believe Michael Jackson ever visited the museum or saw the exhibit and there is therefore little chance he based his image on it. We believe the model is missing a nose because early Christians or Muslims removed noses from paintings and models to make them non-human.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where are Michael Jackson fans going?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "To see what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is michael jackson the king of?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How old is the statue?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is Jackson dead?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many mourners come?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "To do what?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What kind of cheeks does it have?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What kind of nose does it have?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where is it displayed?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Where was it bought?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How long has it been on display?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When was it made?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who are some famous Egyptians", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many people come every day?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What is the statue behind?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who is the director of guest relations", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What do people treat the statue as?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is James Phillips", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 48, "span_text": "Michael Jackson fans are coming a Chicago museum", "input_text": "a Chicago museum", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 49, "span_end": 88, "span_text": "to see a 3,000 year old Egyptian statue", "input_text": "to see a statue", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 95, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "looks remarkably like the late king of pop", "input_text": "pop", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 57, "span_end": 89, "span_text": " 3,000 year old Egyptian statue ", "input_text": "3,000 years", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 117, "span_end": 138, "span_text": "the late king of pop.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 176, "span_end": 201, "span_text": " as thousands of mourners", "input_text": "thousands", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 223, "span_end": 250, "span_text": "to pay tribute to the star.", "input_text": "to pay tribute", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 254, "span_end": 280, "span_text": " statue has skinny cheeks ", "input_text": "skinny cheeks", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 304, "span_end": 318, "span_text": "a tipless nose", "input_text": "a tipless nose", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 329, "span_end": 388, "span_text": "display at the Ancient Egypt exhibition at The Field Museum", "input_text": "at the Ancient Egypt exhibition at The Field Museum", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 423, "span_end": 448, "span_text": " bought in Cairo in 1889 ", "input_text": "in Cairo", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 439, "span_end": 447, "span_text": " in 1889", "input_text": "in 1889", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 452, "span_end": 498, "span_text": "has been on display at the museum for 21 years", "input_text": "for 21 years", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 699, "span_end": 725, "span_text": "between 1550 BC to 1050 BC", "input_text": "between 1550 BC to 1050 BC", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 759, "span_end": 799, "span_text": " famous Egyptians Ramesses and King Tut.", "input_text": "Ramesses and King Tut.", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 813, "span_end": 833, "span_text": "4,500 daily visitors", "input_text": "4,500", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 900, "span_end": 923, "span_text": " behind a glass screen.", "input_text": "a glass screen.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1035, "span_end": 1085, "span_text": " Darnell Williams, the director of guest relations", "input_text": "Darnell Williams", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1092, "span_end": 1155, "span_text": "some fans were treating a visit to the museum like a pilgrimage", "input_text": "like a pilgrimage", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1597, "span_end": 1660, "span_text": "James Phillips, manager of near east and north African exhibits", "input_text": "manager of near east and north African exhibits", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high15521.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3nkqq8o39y57ksfc83wyt4d8v0ludm", "filename": "ZincZinc_6a2627c8dfc9ead57a2a1a90b63c2abdc83fb3c149495acff16dbf23", "story": "Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning). \n\nBrass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc.

Let's listen to what she said. \n\nWhile eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it. \n\nAfter surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I have encountered mostly sleep throughout the night from two or three months old. Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant.

Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 /ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain.\" \n\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret. \n\nOlder people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time. \n\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Are doctors starting to think there is a connection between exercise and brain development?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does judy Cameron's research say about the topic?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Can exercise cause physical changes in the brain?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does it say children need to associalte physical activity with?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What percentage increase in short term memory was a result of exercise in older people?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What should one learn to open up memory paths in the brain that may  not have been used in a long time?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Does Dr. Cameron calm exercise helps concentration?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does the exercise need to increase to help?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How low of time is said to be needed?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What University does Judy Cameron work for?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 17, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 287, "span_end": 383, "span_text": "exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed", "input_text": "exercise can make your brain stronger", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 590, "span_text": " exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 728, "span_end": 819, "span_text": "physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active", "input_text": "physical activity shows greater brain development", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1499, "span_end": 1564, "span_text": "a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising", "input_text": "up to 40 percent", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1782, "span_end": 1847, "span_text": "Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths", "input_text": "Learning some new skills or motions", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 385, "span_end": 458, "span_text": "Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1996, "span_end": 2051, "span_text": " The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood", "input_text": "the brain's flow of blood", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 2057, "span_end": 2136, "span_text": "your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week.", "input_text": "two to three hours of exercise a week.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 139, "span_end": 181, "span_text": "Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health", "input_text": "Oregon Health", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high16785.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3k5tewlkgvbo5iky577egnv41ltvin", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Lyman Frank Baum___Aunt Jane\u2019s Nieces on the Ranch.txt/CHAPTER IV_e31e6a8e133e25f895ab9bc5e4ba110b9d96601dc79035b93425263", "story": "CHAPTER IV\u2014LITTLE JANE\u2019S TWO NURSES \n\nLouise had been considerably puzzled to account for the presence of the strange girl in Uncle John\u2019s party.

No doubt John F. Kennedy felt that he, too, understood the risks when he started sending American advisors to Saigon in the early 1960s. Like JFK, he may be starting a fight he cannot finish, which will run on and on for untold years. \n\nObama, who came to office wearing the mantle of a man of peace and agent of change, has ultimately proved little different in this respect from predecessors such as Ronald Reagan and George W.

o'clock,his three little \"good kids\"--Mike,Randy,and Alex--came down the stairs in their night clothes and shouted \"breakfast,daddy.\"When food had not appeared within thirty seconds,Randy began using his spoon on Alex's head as if it were a drum.Alex started to shout loudly in time to the beat .Mike chanted \"Where's my toast,where's my toast\" in the background.Brad realised his newspaper would have to wait for a few seconds. \n\nLife became worse after breakfast.Mike wore Randy's underwear on his head.Randy locked himself in the bathroom,while Alex shouted again because he was going to wet his pants.Nobody could find clean socks,although they were before their very eyes.Someone named \"Not Me\" had spilled a whole glass of orange juice into the basket of clean clothes.Brad knew the talk show had already started. \n\nBy ten o'clock,things were out of control.Alex was wondering why the fish in the jar refused his bread and butter.Mike was trying to show off his talent by decorating the kitchen wall with his colour pencils.Randy,thankfully,appeared to be reading quietly in the family room,but closer examination showed that he was eating apple jam straight from the bottle with his hands.Brad realised that the talk show was over and reading would be impossible. \n\nAt exactly 11:17,Brad called the daycare centre .\"I suddenly have to go into work and my wife's

of Islamabad in Pakistan's Punjab province. \n\nThe suspects were plotting to attack two Shiite mosques, police stations, and a Norwegian telecommunications company in Punjab, according to district police officer Usman Anwar. Three other suspects linked to the plot were arrested hours later in Sargodha, he said. \n\nThose arrested early Monday included the Pakistani Taliban's chief in Punjab, according to Anwar. \n\nThe Taliban in Punjab have direct ties to Baitullah Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistan Taliban, and have been accused of sectarian murders in Punjab. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claim Mehsud is alive but ill. \n\nHakeemullah Mehsud has been selected as the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a Taliban commander said Saturday. \n\nPakistani authorities also said they thwarted planned attacks in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh province.

McKelvey, 59, allegedly used the gun on three men in an upperdeck scuffle at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during a Sunday match-up between the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, according to New Jersey Police Sgt.

When we received it, I noted how beautifully done it was. While often the case---we see beautifully written and illustrated books all the time---but how often do they come from a 10-year-old? Sewing a Friendship, written by a creative and talented young girl named Natalie Tinti, is such a book. Developing friendships is an area that Natalie Tinti has researched in her own life. In her book, Sewing a Friendship, she tells what great things can happen if kids take a step toward friendship. Tinti's characters in Sewing a Friendship have colorful and creative personalities. Jonsy Jipsy loves singing and belly dance. Sokron Blossom lives in a neat and tidy world and loves to read fashion magazines. Meeka likes brain games and Nina is happy with her life and the music it brings her. All but one of the characters seems happy with their lives. One of the girls, Kiki Shaver, was sad to live in a small home with her aunt and uncle. She had no friend and didn't know how to make them. When four girls invites her into the circle of their friendship, it's no wonder that Kiki is hesitant and uneasy. The story continues as the four girls invite and accept a \" not so likeable\" girl into their circle to win a fashion show. The girls feel a strong bond of friendship after the show. Kiki then understands that taking a step towards friendship is better than being alone. All the girls learn that by having the courage to include others, you can \" sew a friendship\". Today, it seems that almost every news headline begins with a child's suicide---or murder---because of being bullied ,not having friends or family to discuss issues with and feelings of low self -respect.

In the 19thcentury, the famous writer, Edgar Allan Poe, wrote a book called The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. It was about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before three of them decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker. Some years later, in 1884, the boat Mignonette sank, and only four survivors were left in an open boat for many days. Finally the three older members killed and ate the cabin boy. The name of the cabin boy was Richard Parker. \n\n2. In Monza, Italy, King Umberto I went to a small restaurant for dinner. When the owner took King Umberto I's order, the King noticed that he and the restaurant owner were doubles, in face and in build. Both men began discussing the resemblance between each other and found many more similarities. Both men were born in the same place, on the same day, of the same year (March 14, 1844, Turin, Italy). On the day that the King married Queen Margherita, the restaurant owner had married a lady named Margherita. The restaurant owner opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto I was crowned King of Italy. On July 29, 1900, King Umberto I was informed that the restaurant owner had died that day in a shooting accident, and as he expressed his regret, someone in the crowd killed him! \n\n3. Mark Twain was a popular American author who wrote famous books such as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Mark Twain was born on the day of the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, and died on the day of its next appearance in 1910.

This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. \n\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery.

The Dollar Coin Alliance, a lobbying group, says billions could be saved if dollar coins were used instead of paper bills. But many people won't use them. The U.S. government tried to push dollar coins again in recent years, but then suspended almost all production in 2011. American likes paper dollars, but Jim Kolbe, co-chairman of the Dollar Coin Alliance, thinks switching to the coin is worth it. \"The coin does cost more to produce, roughly on the neighborhood of 17 cents versus the 5 or 6 cents that a paper dollar costs to produce,\" he said. \"However, the coin lasts 35 years, and it's made of mostly recycled metals, and the paper has to be produced from new materials, and we shred 3 billion of those every year because they wear out.\" For years, the former Arizona congressman has been pushing legislation that would prop up the dollar coin by phasing out the greenback -- a move that has met resistance from both politicians and the public. But today, he said, _ and a recent poll indicates 61 percent of Americans like the idea. \"When they learn of the savings that can be involved with this, they will support the idea of substituting the coin for the paper dollar,\" he said. Major savings Kolbe points to a study by the Government Accountability Office, which investigates how the government spends taxpayer dollars. The GAO estimates taxpayers would save more than $4 billion over 30 years, and that figure could be much higher. That appeals to taxpayer Christy Thompson, who said, \"I'd probably say, yes, we need to do it.\" But plenty of people aren't convinced, including Kim Doering of Alexandria, Virginia. \"It's easier to carry the paper bill than a bunch of coins. They're louder; they're heavier in your pocket,\" she said. Washington, D.C. restaurant owner Sue Fouladi doesn't like the idea of having more dollar coins in her cash register. \"It's very inconvenient,\" she said. \"If I don't have a choice, then I'll do it, but I'll be a very unhappy person.\" Adding to the problem is that the gold- and silver-colored metal coins are about the same size as the 25-cent quarter. Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University in Washington, says the dollar coins should be a different size and thickness. \"And if we can design a dollar coin that's not so big and bulky, probably Americans would like it better,\" he added. But that doesn't bother college student Emily Sturgill. \"Sometimes they fit into your pocket easily and you don't have to worry about them slipping out, like a dollar bill would if you brought your keys or your phone out,\" she said.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what percent of people like the idea of a dollar coin?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who is a big advocate for the dollar coin?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what group does he chair?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "when did the US suspend production of the dollar coin?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how much does it cost to produce?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "and how much does the paper version cost?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how long does the coin last though?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what do they do with old paper money?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how much does the GAO estimate would be saved by taxpayers by using coins?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "does Sue Fouladi like the idea?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what does she do for a living?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "does she want more coins in her register?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "about what size are the dollar coins?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "where is Robert Blecker a professor?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "does he think they should be the same size?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1107, "span_end": 1109, "span_text": "61", "input_text": "61", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 411, "span_end": 420, "span_text": "Jim Kolbe", "input_text": "Jim Kolbe", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 437, "span_end": 461, "span_text": "the Dollar Coin Alliance", "input_text": "the Dollar Coin Alliance", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 367, "span_end": 375, "span_text": " in 2011", "input_text": "in 2011", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 573, "span_end": 581, "span_text": "17 cents", "input_text": "17 cents", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 593, "span_end": 605, "span_text": "5 or 6 cents", "input_text": "5 or 6 cents", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 679, "span_end": 687, "span_text": "35 years", "input_text": "35 years", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 796, "span_text": " shred ", "input_text": "shred them", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1475, "span_end": 1509, "span_text": "more than $4 billion over 30 years", "input_text": "more than $4 billion over 30 years", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1895, "span_end": 1917, "span_text": " doesn't like the idea", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1867, "span_end": 1883, "span_text": "restaurant owner", "input_text": "she's a restaurant owner", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1896, "span_end": 1918, "span_text": "doesn't like the idea ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 2159, "span_end": 2202, "span_text": "about the same size as the 25-cent quarter.", "input_text": "about the same size as a quarter.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 2245, "span_end": 2278, "span_text": "American University in Washington", "input_text": "American University in Washington", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 2301, "span_end": 2328, "span_text": " should be a different size", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "high9746.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3mhw492ww0da11apqm568g2livsvmk", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Hamlin Garland___Money Magic.txt/CHAPTER XXIV_faa201e09144a9470685e9bc5b5f239f986f0c84edd06302088d939", "story": "CHAPTER XXIV \n\nTHE HANEYS RETURN TO THE PEAKS \n\nThe forces that really move most men are the small, concrete, individual experiences of life.

Standing barely 1.7 meters, the 22-year-old with black-frame glasses might pass more for a Chinese Harry Potter. Yet Shen Huigang is now getting recognition for his bravery in fighting off a cougar on Vancouver Island, Canada, during a family outing. Shen, also known as Ian, was then an exchange student. With him was a friend, Myles Hagar, and Hagar's two grandchildren. Silently and suddenly a cougar appeared out of nowhere. By the time they spotted the cat, it already had the head of 18-month-old Julien in its mouth. \"At first, my brain was nothing but blank,\" Shen recalled. \"But I believed I could get the child back.\" He gestured as if he were ready for a fight, and tried to scare the beast off with his bag. Hearing the noise Shen made, the animal dropped the baby and Hagar rushed to grab his grandson. But the animal didn't run, instead turned toward 3-year-old Iris standing beside Shen. \"Had Ian not been there, shouting at the cougar, remaining calm and standing firm, it would certainly have attacked Iris.\" Hagar recalled. They chased the animal back into the woods. \"We moved slowly to our vehicle as we waved our fists and bags, pretending to wrestle it,\" Shen said. \"The vehicle wasn't far away but it felt like it took us a century to travel the short journey.\" As Hagar drove for help, Shen held the heavily-bleeding boy in the passenger seat and calmly kept him awake by hugging and kissing him in case he would go into a coma . The boy was flown to a hospital nearby. Doctors later said his little skull had been punctured through to his brain in two places. Luckily, Julien made a full recovery. \"Any hesitation, even a second delay, would have resulted in certain death for Julien, but Ian was there...\" Hagar said. Following the incident, the story appeared on Canadian TV networks in every city, and in many small town newspapers---plus many US Internet news sites.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. \n\nThe Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums \"Rubber Soul\" (1965), \"Revolver\" (1966), \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967), \"The Beatles\" (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) and \"Abbey Road\" (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths. McCartney and Starr, the surviving members, remain musically active.

The city's deep history is contrasted with its rapid growth: it was the fastest growing of the top ten largest cities in the United States from 2000 to 2010, and the second from 1990 to 2000. Straddling the regional divide between South and Central Texas, San Antonio anchors the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion colloquially known as the \"Texas Triangle\". \n\nSan Antonio serves as the seat of Bexar\u00a0County. Recent annexations have extended the city's boundaries into Medina County and, though for only a very tiny area near the city of Garden Ridge, into Comal County. Since San Antonio was founded during the Spanish Colonial Era, it has a church (San Fernando Cathedral) in its center, along with a main civic plaza accompanying it in front, a characteristic which is also found in some other Spanish-founded cities, towns, and villages in Spain and Latin America. Due to its placement, the city has characteristics of other western urban centers in which there are sparsely populated areas and a low density rate outside of the city limits. San Antonio is the center of the San Antonio\u2013New Braunfels Metropolitan Statistical Area. Commonly referred to as Greater San Antonio, the metropolitan area has a population of 2,454,061 based on the 2017 US Census estimate, making it the 24th-largest metropolitan area in the United States and third-largest in the state of Texas. Growth along the Interstate 35 and Interstate 10 corridors to the north, west and east make it likely that the metropolitan area will continue to expand.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is this about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where is that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is it the most populated city there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What ranking is it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What about in the country?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was it started as?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it an old city there?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is in the center of it?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What building, in the town?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is it called?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is in front of that?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Where else is that found?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is it thickly populated out of town?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is it the corner of?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Which side?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What is that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What county is it in?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How many people live there?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 11, "span_text": "San Antonio", "input_text": "San Antonio", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 172, "span_end": 177, "span_text": "Texas", "input_text": "Texas", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 143, "span_end": 178, "span_text": "second-most populous city in Texas.", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 142, "span_end": 177, "span_text": " second-most populous city in Texas", "input_text": "Second in Texas.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 87, "span_end": 134, "span_text": "seventh-most populous city in the United States", "input_text": "Seventh in the United States.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 178, "span_end": 207, "span_text": " Founded as a Spanish mission", "input_text": "A Spanish mission.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 212, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "colonial outpost", "input_text": "A colonial outpost.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 232, "span_end": 236, "span_text": "1718", "input_text": "1718", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 323, "span_end": 350, "span_text": "state's oldest municipality", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 568, "span_end": 606, "span_text": "divide between South and Central Texas", "input_text": "Texas.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1003, "span_end": 1049, "span_text": "church (San Fernando Cathedral) in its center,", "input_text": "A church.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1011, "span_end": 1033, "span_text": "San Fernando Cathedral", "input_text": "San Fernando Cathedral", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1061, "span_end": 1080, "span_text": "a main civic plaza ", "input_text": "A civic plaza.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1192, "span_end": 1228, "span_text": "villages in Spain and Latin America.", "input_text": "In villages in Spain and Latin America.", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1360, "span_end": 1404, "span_text": " low density rate outside of the city limits", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 658, "span_end": 718, "span_text": "urban megaregion colloquially known as the \"Texas Triangle\".", "input_text": "The \"Texas Triangle\".", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 620, "span_end": 651, "span_text": "anchors the southwestern corner", "input_text": "The southwestern corner.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 654, "span_end": 675, "span_text": " an urban megaregion ", "input_text": "An urban megaregion.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 742, "span_end": 767, "span_text": " the seat of Bexar\u00a0County", "input_text": "Bexar\u00a0County.", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "San_Antonio.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "35h6s234sa0re4aixfgcfmb0f5y65x", "filename": "Missionary.txt", "story": "A missionary is a member of a religious group sent into an area to proselytize and/or perform ministries of service, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development. The word \"mission\" originates from 1598 when the Jesuits sent members abroad, derived from the Latin \"missionem\" (nom. \"missio\"), meaning \"act of sending\" or \"mittere\", meaning \"to send\". The word was used in light of its biblical usage; in the Latin translation of the Bible, Christ uses the word when sending the disciples to preach in his name. The term is most commonly used for Christian missions, but can be used for any creed or ideology. \n\nA Christian missionary can be defined as \"one who is to witness across cultures\". The Lausanne Congress of 1974, defined the term, related to Christian mission as, \"to form a viable indigenous church-planting movement\". Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world. \n\nJesus instructed the apostles to make disciples of all nations. This verse is referred to by Christian missionaries as the Great Commission and inspires missionary work. \n\nThe New Testament-era missionary outreach of the Christian church from the time of St Paul expanded throughout the Roman Empire and beyond to Persia (Church of the East) and to India (Saint Thomas Christians). During the Middle Ages the Christian monasteries and missionaries such as Saint Patrick (5th century), and Adalbert of Prague (ca 956-997) propagated learning and religion beyond the European boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In 596, Pope Gregory the Great (in office 590-604) sent the Gregorian Mission (including Augustine of Canterbury) into England.

She was almost sightless herself (due to a childhood fever) and was, at one time, diagnosed as hopelessly \"insane\" by her by caregivers. She was locked in the basement of a mental institution outside of Boston. On occasion, Little Annie would violently attack anyone who came near. Most of the time she generally ignored everyone in her presence. An elderly nurse believed there was hope, however, and she made it her mission to show love to the child. Every day she visited Little Annie. For the most part, the child did not acknowledge the nurse's presence, but she still continued to visit. The kind woman left cookies for her and spoke words of love and encouragement. She believed Little Annie could recover, if only she were shown love. Eventually, doctors noticed a change in the girl. Where they once witnessed anger and hostility , they now noted an emerging gentleness and love. They moved her upstairs where she continued to improve. Then the day finally came when this seemingly \"hopeless\" child was released. Anne Sullivan grew into a young woman with a desire to help others as she, herself, was helped by the kindly nurse. It was she who saw the great potential in Helen Keller. She loved her, disciplined her, played with her, pushed her and worked with her until the flickering candle that was her life became a beacon of light to the world. Anne Sullivan worked wonders in Helen's life, but it was a loving nurse who first believed in Little Annie and lovingly transformed an uncommunicative child into a _ teacher. \"If it had not been for Anne Sullivan, the name of Helen Keller would have remained unknown.\" But if it had not been for a kind and dedicated nurse, the name of Anne Sullivan would have remained unknown. And so it goes. Just how far back does the chain of redemption extend? And how for forward will it lead?

The Angles later became the \"north folk\" and the \"south folk\", from which developed the names \"Norfolk\" and \"Suffolk\". Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia, which later merged with Mercia and then Wessex. \n\nSuffolk was originally divided into four separate Quarter Sessions divisions. In 1860, the number of divisions was reduced to two. The eastern division was administered from Ipswich and the western from Bury St Edmunds. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions were made the separate administrative counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk; Ipswich became a county borough. A few Essex parishes were also added to Suffolk: Ballingdon-with-Brundon and parts of Haverhill and Kedington.", "questions": [{"input_text": "where is it located", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who borders it to the north", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "west?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "south?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "and east?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is the name of the main town", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is another important town", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what is so special aboutthem", "turn_id": 8, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "does the county have a lot of hills", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "which direction are the wetlands located", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who took control of the region in the 5th century", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what did they become known as", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Which area did the Suffolk get", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "how was it originally divided", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "when was this number reduced", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "to how many", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "which is the eastern", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "and western?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what act was this under", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 66, "span_text": "Suffolk () is an East Anglian county of historic origin in England", "input_text": "East Anglia", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 68, "span_end": 108, "span_text": "It has borders with Norfolk to the north", "input_text": "Norfolk", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 110, "span_end": 136, "span_text": "Cambridgeshire to the west", "input_text": "Cambridgeshire", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 141, "span_end": 159, "span_text": "Essex to the south", "input_text": "Essex", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 161, "span_end": 191, "span_text": "The North Sea lies to the east", "input_text": "The North Sea", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 193, "span_end": 219, "span_text": "The county town is Ipswich", "input_text": "Ipswich", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 221, "span_end": 351, "span_text": "other important towns include Lowestoft, Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Felixstowe, one of the largest container ports in Europe.

But data gathered by university law schools indicates it's more than 2,000. Fascinating details surrounding some of these exonerations set them apart from the rest. Here are five recent exonerations that made headlines. \n\n1. Michael Morton \n\nThe subject of a CNN film, Michael Morton wasn't home when his wife, Christine, was beaten to death in front of their 3-year-old son at their Austin, Texas-area home in 1986. But a prosecutor said the evidence suggested otherwise. The problem was, the jury was prevented from hearing all the evidence in the case. \n\nWrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, a team of loyal supporters and DNA evidence helped Morton win his freedom in 2011. Last month, Morton's former prosecutor pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause regarding evidence that was not used in the trial. \n\nRead more about Michael Morton's story \n\n2. Brian Banks and the incredible twist \n\nAt age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, college football hopeful Brian Banks followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. \n\nBanks maintained his innocence throughout nearly six years of imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. \n\nBut in 2011, the case took an incredible twist when the alleged victim sent Banks a Facebook friend request. \n\nAccording to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California.

The community of about 3,500 people is 11 miles west of St. Louis. \n\nMartin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, which says it serves \"the modeling, photography, and associated industries.\" In the About Me section of her page, she writes that she had been in beauty pageants for years and \"would really like to do beer advertising.\" \n\nBusch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marking divisions.

The elder Solis was seen a day later in El Paso, Texas, at the home of family members. \n\nHe told FBI agents he drove his son to El Paso, dropped him off at a bus station and doesn't know where he is. \n\nFederal authorities haven't said if Victor Solis would face charges for helping his son leave California. \n\nCNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report. \n\n", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who killed Salome Rodriguez?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How was he killed?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did he do for a living?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What kind of job did his killer have?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How do they know he did it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is that all?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "About what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "To who?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And who else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did police arrest him?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did somebody help him get away?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where did he help him go?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Where in Texas?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Where in El Paso?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 207, "span_end": 314, "span_text": "Henry Solis, a Los Angeles Police Department rookie, is accused of killing 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr.", "input_text": "Henry Solis.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 53, "span_end": 99, "span_text": " in the shooting death of a local truck driver", "input_text": "Shot.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 259, "span_end": 314, "span_text": " is accused of killing 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr.", "input_text": "23.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 57, "span_end": 100, "span_text": "the shooting death of a local truck driver ", "input_text": "Truck driver.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 5, "span_end": 100, "span_text": "A Los Angeles police officer charged with murder in the shooting death of a local truck driver ", "input_text": "Police officer.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 5, "span_end": 52, "span_text": "A Los Angeles police officer charged with murde", "input_text": "Los Angeles.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 207, "span_end": 260, "span_text": "Henry Solis, a Los Angeles Police Department rookie, ", "input_text": "Rookie.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 525, "span_text": "Items left by Solis at the crime scene allowed Pomona police detectives to identify him \"as the individual responsible", "input_text": "Items left by Solis at the crime scene.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 675, "span_end": 769, "span_text": "\"incriminating statements about his role in the murder\" to friends, family members and others,", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 664, "span_end": 730, "span_text": "Solis made \"incriminating statements about his role in the murder\"", "input_text": "Self incriminating statements.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 675, "span_end": 731, "span_text": "\"incriminating statements about his role in the murder\" ", "input_text": "His role in the murder.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 675, "span_end": 741, "span_text": "\"incriminating statements about his role in the murder\" to friends", "input_text": "Friends.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 678, "span_end": 758, "span_text": "criminating statements about his role in the murder\" to friends, family members ", "input_text": "Family members.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 405, "span_text": "Solis disappeared shortly after the shooting.

Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass.

Easter had been very late, so it was the last week of the vacation, and dear old Friar John's handsome face was the first thing they saw at the station, and then his father's portly form, with a tall pretty creature on each side of him, causing Babie to fall back with a cry of glad amazement, \"Oh! Essie and Ellie! Such women!\" \n\nThen the train stopped, and there was a tumult of embracings and welcomes, in the midst of which Jock appeared, having just come by the down train. \n\n\"You'll all come to dinner this evening?\" entreated Caroline. \"My love to Ellen. Tell her you must all of you come.\" \n\nIt was a most delightsome barouche full that drove from the station. Jock took the reins, and turned over coachman and footman to the break, and in defiance of dignity, his mother herself sprang up beside him. The sky was blue, the hedges were budding with pure light-green above, and resplendent with rosy campion and white spangles of stitchwort below.

This year he had a good deal against her. She was vaguely aware of it. The old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love, which she had had when she prayed, was mingled in all her emotions. She did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him. She did not believe in herself primarily: doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her. Certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him. She saw tragedy, sorrow, and sacrifice ahead. And in sacrifice she was proud, in renunciation she was strong, for she did not trust herself to support everyday life. She was prepared for the big things and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust. \n\nThe Easter holidays began happily. Paul was his own frank self. Yet she felt it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood, in whose branches a twilight was tangled, below the bright sky of the afternoon.

When his heart problems led to operation, Jim went through it successfully, and a full recovery was expected. Within days, however, his heart was not beating properly.

Dr. Bruce Smoller, a psychologist , had had many conversations with him, and the more he learned, the stranger he realized Jim's case was. When Jim was a child, his father, a teacher, suffered a heart attack and stayed home to recover. One morning Jim asked his father to look over his homework, promising to come home from school at noon to pick it up. His father agreed, but when Jim returned his father had died. Jim's father was 48. \"I think all his life Jim believed he killed his father,\" Dr. Smoller says. \"He felt that if he had not asked him to look at his homework, his father would have lived. Jim had been troubled by the idea. The operation was the trial he had expected for forty years. \" Smoller believes that Jim willed himself not to live to the age of 48. Jim's case shows the powerful role that attitude plays in physical health, and that childhood experiences produce far-reaching effect on the health of grown-ups.

Bollywood is only a part of the larger cinema of India also known as Indywood, which includes other production centers producing blockbuster films in many other Indian languages. \n\nBy revenue, Bollywood is the largest film producer in India, representing 43% of the net box office, while Telugu and Tamil cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitutes 21% as of 2014. Bollywood is also one of the largest centers of film production in the world. Furthermore, Bollywood is one of the biggest film industries in the world in terms of the number of people employed and the number of films produced. According to J. Matusitz and P. Payano, in 2011, over 3.5 billion tickets were sold across the globe, which in comparison is 900,000 tickets more than Hollywood. Bollywood produced 252 films in 2014 out of a total of 1969 films produced in Indian cinema. \n\nThe name \"Bollywood\" is a portmanteau derived from Bombay (the former name for Mumbai) and Hollywood (in California), the center of the American film industry. The naming scheme for \"Bollywood\" was inspired by \"Tollywood\", the name that was used to refer to the cinema of West Bengal. Dating back to 1932, \"Tollywood\" was the earliest Hollywood-inspired name, referring to the Bengali film industry based in Tollygunge (in Calcutta, West Bengal), whose name is reminiscent of \"Hollywood\" and was the centre of the cinema of India at the time. It was this \"chance juxtaposition of two pairs of rhyming syllables,\" Holly and Tolly, that led to the portmanteau name \"Tollywood\" being coined. The name \"Tollywood\" went on to be used as a nickname for the Bengali film industry by the popular Calcutta-based \"Junior Statesman\" youth magazine, establishing a precedent for other film industries to use similar-sounding names, eventually leading to the coining of \"Bollywood\". \"Tollywood\" is now also popularly used to refer to the Telugu film industry in Telangana and Andhra

All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. \n\nOn Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. \n\nMcLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled. \"Nobody cared.

His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. \n\nLike most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. \n\nBunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. \n\nBunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). \n\nThe Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \n\n\"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the British writers name?", "turn_id": 1},

\n\nWinger Pedro Rodriguez, 22, was named along with his Barcelona teammate Victor Valdes, who edged out 19-year-old David De Gea and Villarreal's Diego Lopez for the third goalkeeping place. \n\nDe Gea's 21-year-old clubmate Javi Martinez was handed a midfield berth, having impressed as Atletico Madrid won the UEFA Europa League this season and reached the final of the Spanish Cup. \n\n\"They have had a good season, they are coming to strengthen the squad as substitutes for other players,\" Del Bosque told reporters. \n\nMartinez's fellow under-21 international, Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta, missed out along with midfielders Santi Cazorla and Marcos Senna, who both featured when Spain won Euro 2008. \n\nSevilla striker Alvaro Negredo was also chopped, as was another member of the triumphant 2008 squad, Dani Guiza. \n\nDel Bosque is giving England-based stars Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit, retaining the duo as they recover from injuries. \n\nMidfielder Andres Iniesta is also expected to be ready, having returned from a calf problem in the last game of the Spanish league season as Barcelona claimed the title. \n\nBarcelona's

Time is regulated by the individual state governments, some of which observe daylight saving time (DST). Australia's external territories observe different time zones. \n\nStandard time was introduced in the 1890s when all of the Australian colonies adopted it. Before the switch to standard time zones, each local city or town was free to determine its local time, called local mean time. Now, Western Australia uses Western Standard Time; South Australia and the Northern Territory use Central Standard Time; while New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) use Eastern Standard Time. \n\nDaylight saving time is used in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and the ACT. It is not currently used in Western Australia, Queensland or the Northern Territory. \n\nThe standardization of time in Australia began in 1892, when surveyors from the six colonies in Australia met in Melbourne for the Intercolonial Conference of Surveyors. The delegates accepted the recommendation of the 1884 International Meridian Conference to adopt Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the basis for standard time. \n\nThe colonies enacted time zone legislation, which took effect in February 1895. The clocks were set ahead of GMT by eight hours in Western Australia; by nine hours in South Australia (and the Northern Territory, which it governed); and by 10 hours in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. The three time zones became known as \"Eastern Standard Time\", \"Central Standard Time\", and \"Western Standard Time\".

His eyes were filled with angry tears. \n\nThe tree was central to our holiday, but it was not what I worried about. I didn't want the boys to feel ashamed every time they looked at it. We had a terrible problem on our hands. I couldn't lower the ceiling, and I couldn't raise the floor either. There was no way to repair the damage. If I couldn't fix the problem, maybe I could get creative with it. A thought came to my mind, which turned to the solution. \n\nI followed them back into the living room.. \"We can't make the tree taller,\" I said. \"But we can put it on a higher position.\" Dan turned his head sideways, measuring the distance with his eyes . \"We can put it on the coffee table and put the lights and decorations on before we lift it up . Thus, we won't need a ladder. It just might work! Let's try it!\" \n\nWhen my husband got home and looked at the big tree on top of the coffee table, Dan and John held their breath. \n\n\"What a good idea!\" he declared, as if the boys had gone beyond all his expectations. \"Why didn't I ever think of such a thing ?\" \n\nJohn broke into a grin.

Her father made a great deal of money in trade. During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston. In her will, she left the museum a million dollars and a series of requirements about how it should be managed. One requirement is that the permanent collection cannot be changed.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where was Isabella Stewart born?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What country did she explore as a child?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What collection did she visit in Milan?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did she meet Julia Gardner?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who later introduced Isabella to who?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who became?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did Isabella enjoy empty museum spaces?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did she find America to be rich in art?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What year did her husband pass?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did she do shortly after his passing?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was the museum called?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 29, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "New York City", "input_text": "New York City", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 46, "span_end": 51, "span_text": "1840.", "input_text": "1840.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 137, "span_end": 143, "span_text": " Italy", "input_text": "Italy", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 205, "span_end": 212, "span_text": "private", "input_text": "private", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 413, "span_end": 418, "span_text": "Paris", "input_text": "Paris", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 575, "span_end": 579, "span_text": "Jack", "input_text": "Jack", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 727, "span_end": 739, "span_text": "Mrs. Gardner", "input_text": "Mrs. Gardner", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 740, "span_end": 751, "span_text": "didn't like", "input_text": "didn't like", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 905, "span_end": 966, "span_text": "America was a young country developing quickly in other areas", "input_text": "America was a young country developing quickly in other areas", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1078, "span_end": 1082, "span_text": "1898", "input_text": "1898", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1125, "span_end": 1144, "span_text": "building her museum", "input_text": "building her museum", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1325, "span_end": 1337, "span_text": "Fenway Court", "input_text": "Fenway Court", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "high9514.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3b1nlc6ugzwx47h7t7ycpjt60j3gpw", "filename": "Aristotle.txt", "story": "Aristotle (; , , \"Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s\"; 384\u2013322\u00a0BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece.

At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c.\u00a0347\u00a0BC). His writings cover many subjects \u2013\u00a0including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government\u00a0\u2013 and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343\u00a0BC. \n\nTeaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.

Block and Curling, and according to promise wrote various letters to Mary Lowther, telling her of the manner in which his business progressed. All of these letters were shown to Aunt Sarah,--and would have been shown to Parson John were it not that Parson John declined to read them. But though the letters were purely cousinly,--just such letters as a brother might write,--yet Miss Marrable thought that they were dangerous. She did not say so; but she thought that they were dangerous. Of late Mary had spoken no word of Mr. Gilmore; and Aunt Sarah, through all this silence, was able to discover that Mr. Gilmore's prospects were not becoming brighter. Mary herself, having quite made up her mind that Mr. Gilmore's prospects, so far as she was concerned, were all over, could not decide how and when she should communicate the resolve to her lover. According to her present agreement with him, she was to write to him at once should she accept any other offer; and was to wait for six months if this should not be the case. Certainly, there was no rival in the field, and therefore she did not quite know whether she ought or ought not to write at once in her present circumstances of assured determination.

The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and the Scottish Borders to the north. To the east is the North Sea coastline with a long distance path. The county town is Alnwick, although the county council is in Morpeth. \n\nThe county of Northumberland included Newcastle upon Tyne until 1400, when the city became a county of itself. Northumberland expanded greatly in the Tudor period, annexing Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1482, Tynedale in 1495, Tynemouth in 1536, Redesdale around 1542 and Hexhamshire in 1572. Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire were incorporated into Northumberland in 1844. Tynemouth and other settlements in North Tyneside were transferred to Tyne and Wear in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. \n\nLying on the Anglo-Scottish border, Northumberland has been the site of a number of battles. The county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high moorland, now largely protected as the Northumberland National Park. Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England, with only 62 people per square kilometre. \n\nNorthumberland originally meant 'the land of the people living north of the River Humber'. The present county is the core of that former land, and has long been a frontier zone between England and Scotland. During Roman occupation of Britain, most of the present county lay north of Hadrian's Wall, and was only controlled by Rome for the brief period of its extension north the Antonine Wall. The Roman road Dere Street crosses the county from Corbridge over high moorland west of the Cheviot Hills into present Scotland to Trimontium (Melrose).

Telecommunications, internet, radio, print, television and postal services in the nation are largely concentrated in the private sector. Several of the telecom firms have begun expanding their activities abroad. The Federal government operates two official radio and television networks, which exist alongside a number of private and foreign stations. Print media in the country is also progressively giving way to news radio stations and online portals, as internet connectivity and access increases. Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence. In 2012, a National Communications Act was also approved by Cabinet members, which lays the foundation for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. \n\nAfter the start of the civil war, various new telecommunications companies began to spring up in the country and competed to provide missing infrastructure.

I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. \n\nI had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. \n\nAfter the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. \n\nI then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him.

Believe it or not, that may be easier than you think. Not all classics are so difficult or complicated. So you're not limited to the simplified versions. And the easier books are not all for children. \n\nIn the original versions ,books may send you to the dictionary. And you might not understand everything you read. But reading one from cover to cover will give you a real sense of accomplishment. \n\nThe key is to find the right books. Let's take a look at these. \n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (C.S. Lewis) \n\nStepping into an old wardrobe, four English schoolchildren find themselves in the magical world of Narnia. On this delightful land, they find friends among the many talking creatures. \n\nThe children soon discover, however, that Narnia is ruled by the White Witch. Edmund, one of the children, falls under her power. Who can free Narnia? Only Aslan, the great and noble lion. He alone knows the Deeper Magic. But the children themselves must help fight the battle against the White Witch and those who serve her. \n\nThe Old Man and the Sea (Ernest Hemingway) \n\nSantiago, an old Cuban fisherman, hasn't caught any fish in more than 80 days. Sailing far out from land, the old man hooks an enormous fish. That begins an agonizing three-day battle. First he struggles against the great fish. Then he must fight off the sharks that circle the little boat and threaten to eat his fish. Exhausted and bleeding, the old man arrives back at shore. But his fish, his beautiful fish . . . \n\nHemingway won the Nobel Prize for this superb story of strength and courage, of victory and regret. \n\nA Wrinkle in Time (Madeleine Lingle) \n\nMeg's father, a U.S. government scientist, has been missing for many months. He had been experimenting with time travel when he mysteriously disappeared. \n\nNow Meg, her little brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin will try to rescue him. But first they must _ the forces of evil they encounter on their journey through time and space. Can they find Meg's father before it's too late? \n\nThis novel is more than just a science-fiction adventure. It's an exploration of the nature of our universe. \n\nThe Pearl (John Steinbeck) \n\nOne day Kino, a poor Mexican pearl diver, finds a magnificent pearl. With it he dreams of buying a better life, new clothes and schooling for his son. Instead, it brings only evil. His wife pleads with him to get rid of it. \"No,\" says Kino. \"I will have my chance. I am a man.\" But when he kills a man who is trying to steal the pearl, Kino and his wife must run for their lives. \n\nThis tale of dreams, justice and the power of greed is told simply and beautifully.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who wrote the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where does it take place?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who is the lion in the story?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is he and the children fighting against?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What award did The Old Man and the Sea receive?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who is it written by?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who wrote A Wrinkle in Time?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is Meg's father's profession?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was he doing when he disappeared?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long has he been gone?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many children will try and rescue him?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What does Kino find?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does he hope it will bring him?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did he want for his son?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did the pearl grant his wishes?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What country is Kino from?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who wrote the story?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How long does Santiago fight for his fish?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How many days had he previously gone without a catch?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What will reading a novel front to back give you?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 524, "span_end": 575, "span_text": "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (C.S.

Merlin's sharp eyes had tried to pierce the gloom, which wrapped the crowd of spectators, searching vainly to distinguish the broad figure and massive head of the provincial giant. \n\nThe light from the petrol lamp shone full on D\u00e9roul\u00e8de's earnest, dark countenance as he looked Juliette's infamous accuser full in the face, but the tallow candles, flickering weirdly on the President's desk, threw Tinville's short, spare figure and large, unkempt head into curious grotesque silhouette.

He had begun as Trafford's pupil and sedulous ape; he had gone on to work that imitated Trafford's in everything except its continual freshness, and now he was ransacking every scrap of suggestion to be found in Trafford's work, and developing it with an intensity of uninspired intelligence that most marvellously simulated originality. He was already being noted as an authority; sometimes in an article his name would be quoted and Trafford's omitted in relation to Trafford's ideas, and in every way his emergence and the manner of his emergence threatened and stimulated his model and master. A great effort had to be made. Trafford revived the drooping spirits of Durgan by a renewed punctuality in the laboratory. He began to stay away from home at night and work late again, now, however, under no imperative inspiration, but simply because it was only by such an invasion of the evening and night that it would be possible to make headway against Behren's unremitting industry.

Henry was the second Tudor monarch, succeeding his father, Henry VII. \n\nHenry is best known for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His disagreement with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings. \n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution, ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Richard Rich, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars, particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the first Tudor monarch?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was the second?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was he born?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was he King?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where was he King?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did his stop serving as the King?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did the Wales acts combine?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When was that?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was the Crown of Ireland Act?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did that put him in charge of?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was his title there?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many wives did he have?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who was his first?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What happened with that marriage?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who argued with him about it?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What did the Church of England separate from?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What movement led to that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who started that?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What happened to him because of that?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 159, "span_end": 168, "span_text": "Henry VII", "input_text": "Henry VII", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 11, "span_text": "Henry VIII ", "input_text": "Henry VIII", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 11, "span_end": 24, "span_text": "(28 June 1491", "input_text": "28 June 1491", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 69, "span_end": 82, "span_text": "21 April 1509", "input_text": "21 April 1509", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 55, "span_end": 63, "span_text": " England", "input_text": "England", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 27, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "28 January 1547", "input_text": "28 January 1547", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 27, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "28 January 1547", "input_text": "28 January 1547", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1921, "span_end": 1939, "span_text": " England and Wales", "input_text": "England and Wales", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1968, "span_end": 1973, "span_text": "1535 ", "input_text": "1535", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1976, "span_end": 1981, "span_text": " 1542", "input_text": "1542", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 2077, "span_end": 2085, "span_text": " Ireland", "input_text": "Ireland", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 2070, "span_end": 2074, "span_text": "King", "input_text": "King", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 199, "span_end": 203, "span_text": " six", "input_text": "six", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 277, "span_end": 296, "span_text": "Catherine of Aragon", "input_text": "Catherine of Aragon", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 297, "span_end": 306, "span_text": " annulled", "input_text": "it was annulled", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 329, "span_end": 338, "span_text": " the Pope", "input_text": "the Pope", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 460, "span_end": 477, "span_text": " papal authority ", "input_text": "papal authority", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 398, "span_end": 421, "span_text": "the English Reformation", "input_text": "the English Reformation", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 380, "span_end": 385, "span_text": "Henry", "input_text": "Henry", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 504, "span_end": 541, "span_text": "Supreme Head of the Church of England", "input_text": "He became Supreme Head of the Church of England", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Henry_VIII_of_England.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3aajc4i4fgs19d9eomhhdun017ejz4", "filename": "mc500.train.52", "story": "Bob was flying a toy plane in his yard.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. \n\nEleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \"guy\" and \"you know\" now appear in research papers. \n\nProfessor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. \n\nDavid Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. \n\nErin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. \n\nAnd what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work?

The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes \"basically everything is worth looking at\", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. \n\nLike Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for some else: \"Why's your car HERE at HER place?\" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. \n\nThe whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? \n\nIn the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely.

Ronda \"Rowdy\" Rousey Former Olympic judo gold medalist Ronda 'Rowdy' Rousey has been dominating women's MMA for the past several years. She earned the nickname \"The Arm Collector\" for winning the majority of her fights via armbars. As of May 2015, no other female MMA has put up much of a challenge against Rousey, but some think that the next entry on this list just might give her trouble. Cristiane 'Cyborg' Justmo Many believe that Cris Cyborg will give Rousey trouble and may even have an outside chance of beating her. While Rousey is an excellent grappler owing to her judo background, Cyborg is a more well-rounded fighter with excellent standup and groundwork skills. This means that just like Rousey, Cyborg can lay some serious beatdown on you. Missy Franklin So you think you are a good swimmer.

Of course, people regard these events with various degrees of literalness.

They describe in slow motion his entry into Jerusalem and the final week leading up to the crucifixion on Good Friday, the uncertain stillness of Holy Saturday, when the world seems to have slipped into total darkness, then the joy of the Resurrection itself, with a sense that boundaries have been broken -- most aggressively, the membrane between life and death. \n\nQuestions arise, of course. Did Jesus really rise from the dead? What would that look like? Many Christians imagine some literal wakening from the dead and refuse to accept the slightest hint that the Resurrection might be regarded as symbolic without denigrating it. \n\nIndeed, if you read the Gospel narratives closely, it's not easy to say what actually happened. All four of them skip the actual Resurrection. That is, we never see Jesus waken. The first inkling of change comes when a few women close to him visit the tomb.

Both are conservative, but clearly that comparison is based on their skin color and not anything else. \n\nThe Republican Party establishment should tread carefully here, because even if members choose not to vote for Watts -- if he decides to even seek the job -- it is his skin color and perspective that is central to the GOP having any sort of presidential future. \n\nWe might as well not play footsie: The Republican Party is a group largely composed of and targeting white Americans. Yes, there are minority Republicans. But considering how President Obama was able to destroy Mitt Romney at the ballot box last month with a racial coalition that rolled up massive support among blacks, Hispanics and Asians, the GOP has a problem. \n\nThe day has passed when the GOP can win the presidency by focusing on white Americans. Folks, this is simple math. With the nation moving toward becoming a majority-minority country, the Republican Party cannot afford to continue to ignore, alienate and, frankly, tick off minority voters. \n\nWhat J.C. Watts is trying to do is to get party leaders to understand that as a former college football legend at the University of Oklahoma, he knows when a failed game plan needs to be thrown out. In football, if you lose, you often get rid of the coach and find someone who can recruit better players to put you on the path to winning.

They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe, their descendants, and indigenous British groups who adopted some aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language. Historically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest. \n\nThe early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation, with many of the aspects that survive today, including regional government of shires and hundreds. During this period, Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language. Charters and law were also established. The term \"Anglo-Saxon\" is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century. In scholarly use, it is more commonly called Old English. \n\nThe history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity. It developed from divergent groups in association with the people's adoption of Christianity, and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms. Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England, this identity was re-established; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest. The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings, dress styles, illuminated texts and grave goods. Behind the symbolic nature of these cultural emblems, there are strong elements of tribal and lordship ties. The elite declared themselves as kings who developed \"burhs\", and identified their roles and peoples in Biblical terms. Above all, as Helena Hamerow has observed, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period.\" The effects persist in the 21st century as, according to a study published in March 2015, the genetic make up of British populations today shows divisions of the tribal political units of the early Anglo-Saxon period.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who were the anglo-saxons?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "around what century?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "how is their language commonly referred to?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what is it more commonly called?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "do anglo-saxons come from one group?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "roughly what year does the anglo-saxon period begin?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "up until what point?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "does that include after the Norman conquest?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who were they threatened by from extended invasions?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what did the elites declare themselves?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what did Helena Hamerow observe?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 34, "span_end": 58, "span_text": " inhabited Great Britain", "input_text": "inhabited Great Britain", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 68, "span_end": 79, "span_text": "5th century", "input_text": "5th century", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 252, "span_end": 263, "span_text": "Anglo-Saxon", "input_text": "Anglo-Saxon", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1009, "span_end": 1020, "span_text": "Old English", "input_text": "Old English", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 107, "span_end": 122, "span_text": "Germanic tribes", "input_text": "yes mainly from Germanic tribes", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 342, "span_end": 378, "span_text": "in Britain between about 450 and 106", "input_text": "in Britain between about 450 and 106", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 379, "span_text": "1066", "input_text": "1066", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 429, "span_end": 445, "span_text": "Norman conquest.", "input_text": "no up untl", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1043, "span_end": 1055, "span_text": "Anglo-Saxons", "input_text": "Anglo-Saxons", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1684, "span_end": 1690, "span_text": " kings", "input_text": "kings", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1835, "span_end": 1876, "span_text": "kin groups remained...the essential unit ", "input_text": "kin groups remained...the essential unit", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Anglo-Saxons.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3nc5l260mom9579b3nffiyo4ovrofz", "filename": "mc500.train.62", "story": "Once upon a time there was a cowgirl named Callie.

If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . \"Everyone should just relax\", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents.\" Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English.

The Macedonians from their side had kept themselves well informed about conditions in Greece. \n\nNow it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished their disastrous war, that Macedonia was ruled by an extraordinarily clever man named Philip. He admired the Greek spirit but he looked down on the Greek lack of self-control in political affairs. It angered him to see a perfectly good people waste its men and money upon fruitless quarrels. So he settled the difficulty by making himself the master of all Greece and then he asked his new subjects to join him on a voyage which he meant to pay to Persia in return for the visit which Xerxes had paid the Greeks 150 years before. \n\nUnfortunately Philip was murdered before he could start this well-prepared expedition . The task of avenging the destruction of Athens was left to Philip's son Alexander, the beloved pupil of Aristotle, wisest of all Greek teachers. \n\nAlexander left Europe in the spring of 334 BC. Seven years later he reached India. In the meantime he had destroyed Phoenicia(,), the old rival of the Greek merchants. He had conquered Egypt and had been worshipped by the people of the Nile valley as the son and heir of the Pharaohs . He had defeated the last Persian king -- he had overthrown the Persian Empire, he had given orders to rebuild Babylon -- he had led his troops into the heart of the Himalayan mountains and had made the entire world a Macedonian province and dependency. Then he stopped and announced even more ambitious plans. \n\nThe newly formed Empire must be brought under the influence of the Greek mind. The people must be taught the Greek language -- they must live in cities built after a Greek model. The Alexandrian soldier now turned school-master. The military camps of yesterday became the peaceful centres of the newly imported Greek civilisation. Higher and higher did the flood of Greek manners and Greek customs rise, when suddenly Alexander was stricken with a fever and died in the old palace of King Hammurabi of Babylon in the year 323BC. \n\nHis Empire did not long survive him.

Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating. Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to 55% of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion. \n\nFungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of Marcelia and fruiting bodies. Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \"noise\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What gets filtered out?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Noise of what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Can fungi communicate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Give me an example of nonverbal communication?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Can you give me one example?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does ones clothing communicate?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What about perspiration?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Give an example of paralanguage", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And another example?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How much communication is paralanguage?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 2129, "span_end": 2157, "span_text": "and even filter out \"noise\",", "input_text": "Noise", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 2130, "span_end": 2203, "span_text": "nd even filter out \"noise\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content", "input_text": "Similar molecules without biotic content.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 987, "span_end": 1004, "span_text": "Fungi communicate", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1359, "span_end": 1554, "span_text": "The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react.", "input_text": "The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1714, "span_end": 1840, "span_text": "So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation", "input_text": "Filamentation", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 101, "span_end": 268, "span_text": "Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 101, "span_end": 268, "span_text": "Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 461, "span_end": 566, "span_text": "Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress", "input_text": "Stress", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 510, "span_end": 566, "span_text": "paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress", "input_text": "Rhythm", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 715, "span_end": 753, "span_text": "and a further 38% through paralanguage", "input_text": "38%", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "CommunicationCommunication_5230273278b464d1f8336cde701a67b368c82b159484a3f13e59eb9b"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k13pb6", "filename": "high3916.txt", "story": "England has been the birthplace of most of the great English-language theater written throughout history.

Rowe, \"agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist\". Agnosticism is a doctrine or set of s rather than a religion. \n\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word \"agnostic\" in 1869. Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife; and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of \"the gods\". The Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe. \n\nBeing a scientist, above all else, Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive.

Because of their love of snakes, the Snake Catchers try to keep them alive. \"One man asked us to kill a python , so he could make a pair of boots from the skin. We refused, because we like snakes, and we don't want to see them killed, \" said Fred. Some of the snakes that they catch are kept as pets; some are given to the North Carolina State University. Most, including the poisonous snakes, are set free in the wild, usually in a national park. Fred suggests that people should treat snakes with care. \"Actually snakes are very shy and gentle creatures. They only attack if they are frightened. However, you have to know how to treat a snake properly!\" According to one happy family, the Snake Catchers are good. One day, the Greenwood family found a snake skin in the kitchen. They looked very carefully and saw a snake sleeping behind a cupboard. They thought about what to do. Then Steve Greenwood remembered the advertisement for the Snake Catchers. He called them. \"The Snake Catchers arrived within an hour and they finished the job quickly too,\" said Steve Greenwood. \"One of them went into the kitchen, found the snake and took it out alive.

The court ruled that the evasiveness of the testimony the former baseball star gave to a grand jury investigating sales of performance-enhancing drugs was sufficient to convict him. \n\nIn an opinion filed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Mary M. Schroeder said the three-judge panel rejected Bonds' contention that he could only have been indicted for obstruction if his testimony had been flatly false. Attorneys for Bonds had argued that Bonds' statements to the grand jury were factually true, and that language in the federal statute under which he was charged is unconstitutionally vague. \n\nThe appeals court rejected that argument. \n\n\"When factually true statements are misleading or evasive, they can prevent the grand jury from obtaining truthful and responsive answers,\" Schroeder wrote. \"They may therefore obstruct and impede the administration of justice within the meaning of the federal criminal statute.\" \n\nBonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of an investigation that targeted his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or BALCO. \n\nThe testimony that led to Bonds' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds whether Anderson ever gave him \"anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.\" \n\nBonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors \"ever touch me,\" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson.
