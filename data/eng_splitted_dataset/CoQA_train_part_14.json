It was established following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521, and following additional conquests, it was made a viceroyalty (Spanish: \"virreinato\") in 1535. The first of four viceroyalties Spain created in the Americas, it comprised Mexico, Central America, much of the Southwestern and Central United States, and Spanish Florida as well as the Philippines, Guam, Mariana and Caroline Islands. \n\nAfter 1535 the colony was governed by the Viceroy of New Spain, an appointed minister of the King of Spain, who ruled as monarch over the colony from its capital, Mexico City. New Spain lost parts of its territory to other European powers and independence, but the core area remained under Spanish control until 1821, when it achieved independence as the Mexican Empire \u2013 when the latter dissolved, it became modern Mexico and Central America. \n\nNew Spain developed highly regional divisions, reflecting the impact of climate, topography, the presence or absence of dense indigenous populations, and the presence or absence of mineral resources. The areas of central and southern Mexico had dense indigenous populations with complex social, political, and economic organization. The northern area of Mexico, a region of nomadic and semi-nomadic indigenous populations, was not generally conducive to dense settlements, but the discovery of silver in Zacatecas in the 1540s drew settlement there to exploit the mines. Silver mining not only became the engine of the economy of New Spain, but vastly enriched Spain and transformed the global economy. New Spain was the New World terminus of the Philippine trade, making the viceroyalty a vital link between Spain's New World empire and its Asian empire.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Did the northern area of Mexico have a small population?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did the Southern and central area of Mexico have a complex social and economic", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did the central and southern areas of Mexico have a small population?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did the Northern area of Mexico have many cities and settlements?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What mineral was found there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where specifically?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who controlled New Spain beginning in 1521?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many centuries did they retain control for?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was the land in New Spain similar throughout the whole area?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What person appointed the Viceroy of New Spain in 1535?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where did the Viceroy of New Spain rule from?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was this the capital?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "The region that became the Mexican empire in 1821, became what when it was later dissolved?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1391, "span_end": 1439, "span_text": "was not generally conducive to dense settlements", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1247, "span_end": 1299, "span_text": "complex social, political, and economic organization", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1168, "span_end": 1242, "span_text": "The areas of central and southern Mexico had dense indigenous populations ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1301, "span_end": 1440, "span_text": "The northern area of Mexico, a region of nomadic and semi-nomadic indigenous populations, was not generally conducive to dense settlements,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1448, "span_end": 1481, "span_text": " discovery of silver in Zacatecas", "input_text": "silver", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1445, "span_end": 1494, "span_text": "the discovery of silver in Zacatecas in the 1540s", "input_text": "in the 1540s", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1446, "span_end": 1481, "span_text": "he discovery of silver in Zacatecas", "input_text": "Zacatecas", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 138, "span_end": 158, "span_text": "the Spanish conquest", "input_text": "the Spanish", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 522, "span_end": 838, "span_text": "After 1535 the colony was governed by the Viceroy of New Spain, an appointed minister of the King of Spain, who ruled as monarch over the colony from its capital, Mexico City.

Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \n\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. \n\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. \n\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. \n\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. \n\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen. \n\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. \n\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\" \n\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,\" she says. \"They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are countries debating?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What country is building wind turbines?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where are they doing it.", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many were built recently?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How much of the country's energy does it account for?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is one of the first things you will see if you fly there?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are the ones in urban places more expensive than ones in the water?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How much cheaper are they?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is becoming more popular these days?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What do they represent?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who said that?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does she reside there?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How much electric does an average house there use?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many people have purchased shares?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many in all were purchased?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is it embraced by the people?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What do they say we have destroyed?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "To do what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who said that?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "While other countries debate whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas", "input_text": "Whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 86, "span_end": 134, "span_text": ", Denmark is building them right in its capital.", "input_text": "Denmark", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 87, "span_end": 134, "span_text": " Denmark is building them right in its capital.", "input_text": "The capital.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 135, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "Three windmills were recently introduced", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 205, "span_text": " Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood", "input_text": "Copenhagen", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 587, "span_text": "With wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply", "input_text": "33%", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 651, "span_end": 787, "span_text": "among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers", "input_text": "chain of sea-based wind towers", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 870, "span_end": 977, "span_text": "Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based.", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 870, "span_end": 976, "span_text": "Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based", "input_text": "They are less than half the price.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1257, "span_end": 1313, "span_text": " the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century", "input_text": "the windmill", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1331, "span_end": 1371, "span_text": " symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,", "input_text": "A symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1314, "span_end": 1402, "span_text": " \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers.", "input_text": "Susanne Sayers.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1373, "span_end": 1402, "span_text": "says resident Susanne Sayers.", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1778, "span_end": 1843, "span_text": "With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year", "input_text": "3,500 kW hours a year", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1923, "span_end": 1971, "span_text": "To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares.", "input_text": "500", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1923, "span_end": 1970, "span_text": "To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares", "input_text": "2,500", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2343, "span_end": 2375, "span_text": "Accepted by the population?

The movie tells the story of Britain's King George VI, who became king after his brother Edward VIII gave up the crown to marry an American woman. \n\nAs a result of British actor Colin Firth's performance, people are starting to realize that stammering can damage a person's self-confidence and cause him or her to escape from life. \n\n\"The serious problem is unseen and unheard,\" said Norbert Lieckfeldt, an expert at the British Stammering Association, in an interview with a news reporter. \n\n\"Stammering masks your ability,\" he said. \"It's a serious disability.\" \n\nMost stammerers face bullying in school, something that is \"usually carried over into the workplace\". \n\nGeorge VI's stammer took away his confidence as a speaker. But Samantha Mesango, a speech coach based in the UK, believes that speech problems are more common than most people realize. \"Some simply don't like the sound of their own voice; others are scared of speaking in public,\" she said. \n\nTravis Treats from St.Louis University praisedThe King's Speech. He said it shows that \"how one's speech does not mean what one is inside\".

Within a month doctors told him that he had color1ectal cancer. After stock market hours on November 22nd, the fast-food firm said he had resigned; it would need a third boss in under a year. Yet when the market opened, its share price barely dipped then edged higher. After all, McDonald's had, again, shown how to act swiftly and decisively in appointing a new boss. \n\nMr. Bell himself got the top job when Jim Cantalupo died of a heart attack hours before he was due to address a convention of McDonald's franchisees . Mr. Cantalupo was a McDonald's veteran brought out of retirement in January 2003 to help remodel the firm after sales began falling because of dirty restaurants, indifferent service and growing concern about junk food. He devised a recovery plan, backed by massive marketing, and promoted Mr. Bell to chief operating officer. When Mr. Cantalupo died, a rapidly convened board confirmed Mr. Bell, a 44-year-old Australian already widely seen as his heir apparent, in the top job. The convention got its promised chief executive's address, from the firm's first non-American leader. \n\nYet within weeks executives had to think about what to do if Mr. Bell became too ill to continue. Perhaps Mr. Bell had the same thing on his mind: he usually introduced Jim Skinner, the 60-year-old vice-chairman, to visitors as the \"steady hand at the wheel\". Now Mr. Skinner, an expert on the firm's overseas operations, becomes chief executive, and Mike Roberts, head of its American operations, joins the board as chief operating officer. \n\nIs Mr. Roberts now the new heir apparent? Maybe. McDonald's has brought in supposedly healthier choices such as salads and toasted sandwiches worldwide and, instead of relying for most of its growth on opening new restaurants, has turned to upgrading its 31,000 existing ones. America has done best at this; under Mr. Roberts, like-for-like sales there were up by 7. 5% in October on a year earlier. \n\nThe new team's task is to keep the revitalization plan on course, especially overseas, where some American brands are said to face political hostility from consumers. This is a big challenge. Is an in-house succession(, ) the best way to tackle it? Mr. Skinner and Mr. Roberts are both company veterans, having joined in the 1970s. Some recent academic studies find that the planned succession of a new boss from within, such as Mr. Bell and now (arguably) Mr. Roberts, produces better results than looking hastily, or outside, for one. McDonald's smooth handling of its serial misfortunes at the top certainly seems to prove the point.

Acevedo kept a diary that details the day-to-day events inside the camp and lists names and prisoner numbers of men as they died or were executed. See inside Acevedo's diary \u00bb \n\nThat story prompted a chain of events, including hundreds of CNN.com users urging their congressional leaders to honor the soldiers of Berga.

Typically, regions with summer time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time. \n\nNew Zealander George Hudson proposed the modern idea of daylight saving in 1895. Germany and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on 30 April 1916.

He had set out in all haste from Cordova to the relief of Salobrena, but hearing on his march that the siege was raised, he turned to make a second ravage round the walls of devoted Granada. His present forage lasted fifteen days, in the course of which almost everything that had escaped his former desolating visit was destroyed, and scarce a green thing or a living animal was left on the face of the land. The Moors sallied frequently and fought desperately in defence of their fields, but the work of destruction was accomplished, and Granada, once the queen of gardens, was left surrounded by a desert. \n\nFerdinand next hastened to crush a conspiracy in the cities of Guadix, Baza, and Almeria. These recently conquered places had entered into secret correspondence with Boabdil, inviting him to march to their gates, promising to rise upon the Christian garrisons, seize upon the citadels, and surrender them into his power. The marques of Villena had received notice of the conspiracy, and suddenly thrown himself with a large force into Guadix. Under pretence of a review of the inhabitants he made them sally forth into the fields before the city. When the whole Moorish population capable of bearing arms was thus without the walls, he ordered the gates to be closed. He then permitted them to enter two by two and three by three, and take forth their wives, children, and effects. The houseless Moors were fain to make themselves temporary hovels in the gardens and orchards about the city; they were clamorous in their complaints at being thus excluded from their homes, but were told they must wait with patience until the charges against them could be investigated and the pleasure of the king be known.* ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who reappeared in Vega?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was he leading?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who else?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where did he leave from?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How long did his forage last?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did any animals remain?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who defended their fields?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was Granada once known as?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where did Ferdinand work to crush first?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What other city?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And lastly?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who had those 3 had secret communications with?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did they invite him to do?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did they promise him?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Anything more?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who received notice of the conspiracy?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 177, "span_end": 191, "span_text": "King Ferdinand", "input_text": "King Ferdinand", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 208, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "seven thousand horse", "input_text": "seven thousand horse", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 233, "span_end": 253, "span_text": "twenty thousand foot", "input_text": "twenty thousand foot", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 316, "span_end": 323, "span_text": "Cordova", "input_text": "Cordova", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 499, "span_end": 512, "span_text": " fifteen days", "input_text": "fifteen days", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 619, "span_end": 691, "span_text": "scarce a green thing or a living animal was left on the face of the land", "input_text": "scarce a green thing or a living animal was left on the face of the land", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 702, "span_text": "The Moors", "input_text": "The Moors", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 837, "span_end": 857, "span_text": "the queen of gardens", "input_text": "the queen of gardens", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 957, "span_end": 963, "span_text": "Guadix", "input_text": "Guadix", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 965, "span_end": 969, "span_text": "Baza", "input_text": "Baza", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 975, "span_end": 982, "span_text": "Almeria", "input_text": "Almeria", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1060, "span_end": 1067, "span_text": "Boabdil", "input_text": "Boabdil", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1085, "span_end": 1105, "span_text": "march to their gates", "input_text": "march to their gates", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1120, "span_end": 1153, "span_text": "rise upon the Christian garrisons", "input_text": "rise upon the Christian garrisons", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1155, "span_end": 1178, "span_text": "seize upon the citadels", "input_text": "seize upon the citadels", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1184, "span_end": 1213, "span_text": "surrender them into his power", "input_text": "surrender them into his power", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1215, "span_end": 1237, "span_text": "The marques of Villena", "input_text": "The marques of Villena", "turn_id": 17}], "name": "data/gutenberg/txt/Washington Irving___Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada.txt/CHAPTER LXXXIX_7ab79628872c6236a678621e7ca6708737f179970611727bc5c9897"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3r9wasfe2zgl4bni5wqwywv89y4zfl", "filename": "high8158.txt", "story": "The HOPE IS A GAME--CHANGER PROJECT will deliver unbreakable soccer balls to kids who, all too often, see things horrible, broken and not survive the simplest of circumstances.

He likewise carried a heavy bludgeon, somewhat like a policeman's baton, which was slung at his side. Not content with this, he sought and obtained permission to carry the axe in his belt.

From 2005 to 2008, Myspace was the largest social networking site in the world, and in June 2006 surpassed Google as the most visited website in the United States. In April 2008, Myspace was overtaken by Facebook in the number of unique worldwide visitors, and was surpassed in the number of unique U.S. visitors in May 2009, though Myspace generated $800 million in revenue during the 2008 fiscal year. Since then, the number of Myspace users has declined steadily in spite of several redesigns. As of March 2017, Myspace was ranked 3,178 by total Web traffic, and 1,650 in the United States. \n\nMyspace had a significant influence on pop culture and music and created a gaming platform that launched the successes of Zynga and RockYou, among others.

Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958\u20131961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries and he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms.

The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a \"Digital World\", a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks. In many incarnations, Digimon are raised by humans called \"Digidestined\" or \"Tamers\", and they team up to defeat evil Digimon and human villains who are trying to destroy the fabric of the Digital world. \n\nThe franchise was first created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to\u2014and influenced in style by\u2014the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics.

In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017. However crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending as the company announced those features will be transferred to Google's Local Guides programme. \n\nGoogle Maps' satellite view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at , while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis.

Joan feels hurt for Sally seems completely uninterested in her baby. Sally, who has no children, claims that her younger sister \"acts as if no one ever had a baby before.\" \n\nNeither Sally nor Joan understands that the real cause of the current coldness is that their family roles have suddenly changed to the opposite. Finally Joan seems to be better than her elder sister--and Sally doesn't like it! Their distance may be temporary, but it shows that childhood competition don't fade easily as ages grow. It can remain powerful in relationships throughout life. \n\nIn a study of the University of Cincinnati, 65 men and women between ages 25 and 93 were asked how they felt about their brothers and sisters. Nearly 75 percent admitted having hidden competitive feelings. In a few cases, these emotions were so strong as to have affected their entire lives. \n\nMany adult brothers and sisters are close, supportive--yet still tend to compete. Two brothers I know turn into killers when on opposite sides of a tennis net. Off the court, they are the best of friends. My own younger sister can't wait to tell me when I've put on weight. However, she's a terrible cook and that pleases me; I tease her when she comes to dinner. Happily, despite these small failings, we have been an important resource for each other. \n\nIn between the very competitive and the generally supportive children lie those who say that no friendship should survive. _ .

Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as The Unicode Standard, the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 120,000 characters covering 129 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). As of June 2015[update], the most recent version is Unicode 8.0. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. \n\nUnicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2.

He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\" Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. \n\nAt the age of 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health.

The news seemed to stun both men at first, but the after-effect on each was wonderfully different. The blood rushed to Okiok's face like a torrent. He clenched his hands and teeth, glared and stamped, and went on like one deranged--as indeed for the moment he was.

He was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith, who together with his predecessor, Neil Kinnock, had started to move the party closer to the political centre, in the hope of winning power. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, the equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity, also referred to as the Third Way. Critics of Blair denounced him for bringing the Labour Party towards the perceived centre ground of British politics, abandoning 'genuine' socialism and being too amenable to capitalism.

His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. \n\nPlay patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. \n\nWhile some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. \n\nThe deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \"age compression \", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that nearly half of the US children start on video games at 4 to 5 years old--and 20% at age 3 or younger. \n\nToy companies, of course, have long seen this trend. Several of the toys expected to sell well this season are, in fact, those that involve video gaming and DVD technologies. Mattel's Fisher-Price introduced a game system called InteracTV this year, featuring DVDs with characters like Dora the explorer. Hasbro came out with a portable color1 video player called VideoNow and has been putting classic games like Battleship and Yahtzee into hand-held electronic format.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How old is the boy?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "And how many hours a day does he play?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "He gets gifts like board games, puzzles and what?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How old is his sister?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "She plays dressup with what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "The sales were down how much percent?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Videogames are predicted to be up due to what game in particular?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What hasn't there been in years?", "turn_id": 8, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "2 toy divisions have had growth in purchases over the past year, what are they?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Which 2 have been the least selling categories?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 37, "span_end": 49, "span_text": "9 years old,", "input_text": "9 years old", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 48, "span_end": 193, "span_text": ", would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed hours later. \n", "input_text": "14 bleary-eyed hours later", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 194, "span_end": 277, "span_text": "Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies-", "input_text": "art supplies", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 346, "span_end": 378, "span_text": "His sister Michaely, 6 years old", "input_text": "6 years old", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 345, "span_end": 413, "span_text": " His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies.", "input_text": "still likes dressing her Barbies.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 579, "span_end": 651, "span_text": " toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year", "input_text": "Five", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 750, "span_end": 875, "span_text": ".

Concern was worsened by incidents such as the death of the professional boxer Bradley Stone. But the Croxteth example was winning more supporters. Mr. Andrews said the idea was particularly well received in the north-east of England. \n\n\"The interest shown so far has been enormous,\" he said. \"I believe that boxing will come back into schools. A video has been produced to promote boxing in schools, and a bid has been made for a Sports Council grant .\" \n\nHe said, \"I think there is a genuine recognition that there are aspects to boxing, if it is controlled and properly run, that really are very beneficial for children. This scheme takes away the dangers. I hope boxing can be promoted throughout the country in a more coordinated way.\" Such an idea horrifies such groups as the British Medical Association (BMA) and the British Safety Council, both critics of the idea. \n\nDr Jeffrey Cundy, the joint author of a BMA report on boxing, accepted that the scheme in Liverpool was non-contact, but he was still opposed. He said, \"We feel that children should still not be introduced to boxing, because they will then be encouraged to take up an activity which is uniquely dangerous when actual contact takes place.\" \n\nHe added, \"There is a whole range of sports which will teach the discipline that comes from boxing without the dangers. We see this reintroduction in schools as an unhealthy development.\" \n\nAt the 800-pupil Croxteth school, Steve Stewart, head of PE, said boxing had helped to improve self-confidence, self-discipline, self-awareness and self-respect in those taking part.

But there was a fundamental difference between these beloved men. While Gandhi was thought to be a depressed family man, Mandela was a strong and loving family man. Even so, Mandela and his family paid dearly for his devotion to his country's freedom. \n\nMandela himself offered a glimpse into his personal war. \"To be the father of a nation is a great honor, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy. _ \" he said in April 1992, announcing his separation from Winnie. \n\nIn 1944, Nelson Mandela married Evelyn. \"I could not give up my life in the struggle,\" Mandela explained in his autobiography , Long Walk to Freedom, \"and she (Evelyn) could not live with my devotion to something other than herself and her family...

Winnie also attended the funeral. \n\nMandela married Winnie in 1958. But Winnie bore the hardship of life as Mandela, enduring her husband's 27-year imprisonment. From prison, Mandela wrote some of the greatest love letters to Winnie. \"I dust it (your photo) carefully every morning - I even touch your nose with mine to regain the electric current that used to run through my blood whenever I did so.\" \n\nFor many South Africans, it was the end of a fairytale love story when their separation was made public in 1992. \"Tensions\" had arisen and they had agreed on a separation. The hurt in his words was clear: \"Perhaps I was blinded to certain things because of the pain I felt for not being able to play my role as a husband to my wife and a father to my children.\" \n\n\"Unstable personal lives seemed freedom fighters' destiny ,\" he said. \"When your life is the struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family.

In her poems, the South Side is called Bronzeville. It was \"A Street in Bronzeville\" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection. \n\nIn 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. She won the prize for her second book of poems called \"Annie Allen\". \"Annie Allen\" is a collection of poetry about a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother. She experiences loneliness, loss, death andpoverty . \n\nGwendolyn Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life. \n\nHer next work was a novel written in 1953 called \"Maud Martha\". \"Maud Martha\" attracted little attention when it was first published.

Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy.

Being a typist, Bette was increasingly _ with being unable to erase her typing mistakes. The messy business left her hands black and the paper dirty. Bette was good at painting and remembered that an artist paints over mistakes. She applied that same principle to typing mistakes and Liquid Paper was born, making Bette into a self-made millionaire. \n\nKevlar, yes, the Kevlar of the bullet proof vest --what police officers and soldiers wear, was invented by Stephanie Kwolek. Stephanie worked for the DuPont Company as a research chemist. She was asked to find a high-performance fiber. Originally, this fiber was intended to be used for car tires . However, the fiber she developed in 1964 was amazing and is still used in products such as sailboats, skis, shoes, and yes, bullet proof vests. In 1995 Stephanie was named to the National Inventor's Hall of Fame. \n\nMargaret Knight invented a machine that revolutionized the making of paper bags. Paper bags had been made like envelopes but Margaret developed a machine that would fold and paste a flat-bottom paper bag, the very same type we still use today. Margaret's family was poor and she started working at the age of nine. Her first invention at the age of twelve was a safety tool for a loom . Later she worked for the Columbia Paper Bag Company. It was there that she worked on improving the making of paper bags. She was issued her patent in 1870. \n\nSo next time you use a new product or an old one, will you wonder who made it? Do some research on the web and answer a few questions like: Who invented it? How was it invented? You may be surprised at some of the stories you uncover.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Women invented which 3 common products?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who invented liquid paper?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was the product originally called?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was Bette before becoming an inventor?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "She was also good at what?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who invented the bullet proof vest?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When was it developed?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it still used today?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What honor did she receive in 1995?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did Margaret Knight invent?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "At what age did she begin working?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "At what age did she have her first invetion?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did she create?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When was her patent issued?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 47, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "Liquid Paper, Kevlar or paper bags", "input_text": "Liquid Paper, Kevlar or paper bags", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 217, "span_end": 267, "span_text": "Liquid Paper was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham ", "input_text": "Bette Nesmith Graham", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 217, "span_end": 275, "span_text": "Liquid Paper was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 ", "input_text": "1951", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 275, "span_end": 310, "span_text": "and originally called Mistake Out.

Everything was ready for the start, but he lingered on, spending much time in Joan's company and thereby increasing the dislike Sheldon had taken to him. He went swimming with her, in point of rashness exceeding her; and dynamited fish with her, diving among the hungry ground-sharks and contesting with them for possession of the stunned prey, until he earned the approval of the whole Tahitian crew. Arahu challenged him to tear a fish from a shark's jaws, leaving half to the shark and bringing the other half himself to the surface; and Tudor performed the feat, a flip from the sandpaper hide of the astonished shark scraping several inches of skin from his shoulder. And Joan was delighted, while Sheldon, looking on, realized that here was the hero of her adventure-dreams coming true. She did not care for love, but he felt that if ever she did love it would be that sort of a man--\"a man who exhibited,\" was his way of putting it. \n\nHe felt himself handicapped in the presence of Tudor, who had the gift of making a show of all his qualities. Sheldon knew himself for a brave man, wherefore he made no advertisement of the fact. He knew that just as readily as the other would he dive among ground-sharks to save a life, but in that fact he could find no sanction for the foolhardy act of diving among sharks for the half of a fish. The difference between them was that he kept the curtain of his shop window down. Life pulsed steadily and deep in him, and it was not his nature needlessly to agitate the surface so that the world could see the splash he was making. And the effect of the other's amazing exhibitions was to make him retreat more deeply within himself and wrap himself more thickly than ever in the nerveless, stoical calm of his race.

He wants to make sure his grandfather is provided for when he dies. His memory of his daughter's suffering and early death gives him a fear of poverty. Gambling becomes an addiction for Nell's grandfather, which results in his financial and physical ruin. Nell and her grandfather flee from their home and begin a journey that has no destination. For Nell, all she wants is a peaceful existence with enough to live on. \n\nThey come across many interesting people on their travels and often meet with the kindness of strangers. Yet, in a colorful world, they also face the reality of the Industrial Revolution. From simple villages and fields of flowers, they go into a dirty city full of mass unemployment and plague victims --- where children die of starvation and many are abandoned. \n\nThe story isn't only about Nell and her grandfather, but also the people who are connected to them directly or indirectly. There is Richard Swiveller, a careless young man who is a friend of Nell's older brother, who wants Swiveller to marry Nell for the fortune he thinks she has. Daniel Quilp is a cruel moneylender, who manages to fool the grandfather into borrowing large sums of money from him. There is honest Kit, a boy employed at the shop, who becomes a victim even though he never harms other people. Kit desires to help Nell, whom he considers an angel that has always inspired the best in him. The mysterious Bevis Marks, who is a generous customer to some people and an enemy to others, also has his own reasons for looking after Nell and her grandfather. \n\nUnlike Dickens' other works, The Old Curiosity Shop is a book of contrasts: the purity of Nell compared to the dishonesty of Quilp, fresh air and scenic villages to the polluted, stone-covered city, etc. Even people's reaction to the book presented a cruel contrast. At first, Nell Trent was praised and considered Dickens' best character. Later, she was criticized by many well-known people like Oscar Wilde.

His early life was not happy. His parents separated when he was 11. Most of his education came informally from Gustave Flaubert--his mother's friend and his godfather, a journalist and novelist. Often Flaubert would let him take a walk and then ask him to write 100 lines about what he saw. This type of training developed in Maupassant a sense of observation, which he later put to use in his writing. Flaubert also allowed Maupassant to attend his Sunday gatherings with others in his literary circle \n\nFor a few years, Maupassant was connected with the Ministry of Public Instruction. It is interesting to note that Monsieur Loisel, a poor man character in The Necklace, worked there. He also served in the French army during the Franco-Prussian War. His favorite writing subjects were peasants, servants, in the city, and the Francd-Prussian War. \n\nAt an early age, Maupassant started writing short stories. In 1880, some of his works were published and he received a wide reputation for Boule de Suif (Ball of Tallow). With this success, he began to work full-time on writing. During the next ten years, he wrote over 300 stories, including six novels, three travel books, and a book of verse. Through them, he earn a lot of money. \n\nHis writing was classical and simple, avoiding social comments and dirty details. His works often showed a real world and an accurate knowledge of the subject. Although Maupassant wrote in many forms, he received widest recognition for his short stories.

G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind. \n\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida. \n\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands. \n\nWhat helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story.

For the last three weeks, the family ate out a lot--sometimes having Macdonald's hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As for housekeeping, a home economics teacher had told Bob that a room always looks clean if the bed is made. \"I found an easier way-----I shut the doors, \" he says. Soon the kids were wearing the same clothes for a week. \"I made them wear their shirts inside out, and when we went to pick up Pat at work they turned them right side out so they would look clean.\" \n\nNow that Bob has publicly admitted he was wrong, he is routinely sharing the child-raising and household tasks with Pat.

THE SIEGE OF FAENZA \n\nThe second campaign of the Romagna had opened for Cesare as easily as had the first.

Where grown men had fled cravenly at his approach, it remained for a child to resist him at Faenza, as a woman had resisted him at Forli. \n\nHis progress north from Pesaro was of necessity slow. He paused, as we have seen, at Rimini, and he paused again, and for a rather longer spell, at Forli, so that it was not until the second week of November that Astorre Manfredi--the boy of sixteen who was to hold Faenza--caught in the distance the flash of arms and the banners with the bull device borne by the host which the Duke of Valentinois led against him. \n\nAt first it had been Astorre's intent to follow the examples set him by Malatesta and Sforza, and he had already gone so far as to remove his valuables to Ravenna, whither he, too, meant to seek refuge. But he was in better case than any of the tyrants so far deposed inasmuch as his family, which had ruled Faenza for two hundred years, had not provoked the hatred of its subjects, and these were now ready and willing to stand loyally by their young lord. But loyalty alone can do little, unless backed by the might of arms, against such a force as Cesare was prepared to hurl upon Faenza.

CNN takes a closer look at the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and how he's becoming more popular with every game. \n\nWho is Jeremy Lin? \n\nBorn to parents Shirley and Gie-Ming on August 23, 1988, Lin is an Asian-American NBA player for the New York Knicks. He wears the jersey No. 17 and plays as point guard. As a professional basketballer he's not overly tall, measuring 6 feet, 3 inches (191 centimeters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). He played for four years at Harvard, and has spent just one year as a professional player. \n\nCareer highlights: \n\nFollowing his stint at Harvard (where he was twice named to the all-Ivy League), Lin failed to get drafted by an NBA franchise, and instead signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors in July, 2010. In December 2011, Lin signed with the New York Knicks after being cut by the Houston Rockets. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. \n\n'Linsanity': Why the hype? \n\nEveryone loves a battle-against-the-odds story, and Lin fits the bill perfectly. The reasons for his meteoric rise to become a U.S. basketball sensation are numerous, but it all starts with talent. In just weeks he's gone from one-time bench-warmer to team savior, leading the Knicks to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game, while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50%. In Friday's game against Kobe Bryant's L.A. Lakers, he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone.

It has a population of 103,000 people, of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. \n\nTonga stretches across approximately in a north-south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west. \n\nTonga became known in the West as the Friendly Islands because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the \"\u02bbinasi\" festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tu\u02bbi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan. \n\nFrom 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status, with the United Kingdom looking after its foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship. The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive path towards becoming a constitutional monarchy rather than a traditional absolute kingdom, after legislative reforms passed a course for the first partial representative elections.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What has a nickname that sounds like a nice place?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is the nickname?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why is it called that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was this?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was there a party when he showed up?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Called what?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Were they planning to murder him?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Why didn't they?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Says whom?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long did the Brits protect them?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did any other place ever control them?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Are there a lot of islands there?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Do folks live on all of them?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many are occupied?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many total folks live there?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Most live where?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What borders it?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "And?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Does it have a constitution?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 643, "span_end": 697, "span_text": "Tonga became known in the West as the Friendly Islands", "input_text": "Tonga", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 643, "span_end": 698, "span_text": "Tonga became known in the West as the Friendly Islands ", "input_text": "the Friendly Islands", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 677, "span_end": 763, "span_text": "the Friendly Islands because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook", "input_text": "because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 745, "span_end": 790, "span_text": "Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773", "input_text": "in 1773", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 792, "span_end": 839, "span_text": "He arrived at the time of the \"\u02bbinasi\" festival", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 792, "span_end": 839, "span_text": "He arrived at the time of the \"\u02bbinasi\" festival", "input_text": "the \"\u02bbinasi\" festival", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1021, "span_end": 1051, "span_text": "the chiefs wanted to kill Cook", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1021, "span_end": 1102, "span_text": "the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan", "input_text": "they could not agree on a plan", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 980, "span_end": 1019, "span_text": "According to the writer William Mariner", "input_text": "William Mariner", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1106, "span_end": 1165, "span_text": "From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status", "input_text": "70 years", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1255, "span_end": 1322, "span_text": "The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 156, "span_text": "comprising 169 islands", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 156, "span_text": "comprising 169 islands", "input_text": "169", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 158, "span_end": 183, "span_text": "of which 36 are inhabited", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 158, "span_end": 183, "span_text": "of which 36 are inhabited", "input_text": "36", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 262, "span_end": 300, "span_text": " It has a population of 103,000 people", "input_text": "103,000", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 309, "span_end": 352, "span_text": " 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu", "input_text": "Tongatapu", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 490, "span_end": 512, "span_text": "Samoa to the northeast", "input_text": "Samoa", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 514, "span_end": 530, "span_text": "Niue to the east", "input_text": "Niue", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1333, "span_end": 1402, "span_text": "Tonga took a decisive path towards becoming a constitutional monarchy", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Tonga.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3yj6na41jbg7v9781djfmwlmscbjpw", "filename": "Kanji.txt", "story": "Kanji, or \"kan'ji\", are the adopted logographic Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese writing system along with hiragana and katakana.

Chinese coins from the first century AD have been found in Yayoi-period archaeological sites. However, the Japanese of that era probably had no comprehension of the script, and would remain illiterate until the fifth century AD.

For example, the diplomatic correspondence from King Bu of Wa to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in 478 has been praised for its skillful use of allusion. Later, groups of people called \"fuhito\" were organized under the monarch to read and write Classical Chinese.

The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most urbanized and densely populated section. It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the Sauratown Mountains, Pilot Mountain, the Uwharrie Mountains, Crowder's Mountain, King's Pinnacle, the Brushy Mountains, and the South Mountains. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices. Agriculture is steadily declining in importance. The major rivers of the Piedmont, such as the Yadkin and Catawba, tend to be fast-flowing, shallow, and narrow.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is in the eastern section of North Carolina?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "and extremely east of that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "how many sections is North Carolina divided into?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "how many \"sounds\" does it have?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "which is the southern sound?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "which region of North Carolina is most urbanized?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "where is it situated?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "are the sounds landlocked?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "which one is in the North?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "are there bigger ones in the U.S.?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what is the highest elevation in Piedmont?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is agriculture still big there?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "how many rivers are mentioned?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "are they wide?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "are they shallow or deep?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what is happening to the rural area? of Piedmont?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 59, "span_end": 131, "span_text": "the Atlantic Coastal Plain, which occupies the eastern 45% of the state;", "input_text": "the Atlantic Coastal Plain", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 228, "span_end": 402, "span_text": " The extreme eastern section of the state contains the Outer Banks, a string of sandy, narrow barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and two inland waterways or \"sounds\":", "input_text": "the Outer Banks", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 58, "span_text": "North Carolina consists of three main geographic sections:", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 369, "span_end": 463, "span_text": "two inland waterways or \"sounds\": Albemarle Sound in the north and Pamlico Sound in the south.", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 436, "span_end": 463, "span_text": "Pamlico Sound in the south.", "input_text": "Pamlico Sound", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 711, "span_end": 820, "span_text": " The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most urbanized and densely populated section.

But that's not her way. Five years after losing her vision, Clements is back doing what she loves. \"It is long, Kathy,\" Clements says, running her hands down the length of her client's hair. Kathy Braga is letting it grow. It now hangs below her shoulders and down her back, and all she wants is a trim , so she asks Clements to show her how much an inch would be. Clements pulls a ruler from a drawer and holds it up to Braga's hair in front near her face. \"Right here. An inch will be right here at your chin.\" Clements was in this career for about 10 years before losing her vision. Now, when she begins cutting, it's easy to forget that Clements is completely blind. She carefully compares the length of each strand of hair. Though confident of her sense of touch, she at times asks her client to be her eyes and check her work. After a careful inspection, Braga gives her approval. And after Clements blows her hair dry, she remarks, \"You made me younger. I love it.\" Clements had been doing Braga's hair for years before she became blind. Braga is proud to say she was Clements' first customer after she lost her vision. \"She sat me in the kitchen. It was dark, and she said ,' Are you ready?' I said, 'I'm ready.' And that is when she took this thing, and she said, ' Look and see if there is hair on the ground,' and I said ,' Yes, there is .' And she said, 'Okay, I have the right end of the thing.\" Clements was 42 years old when she suffered a pulmonary embolism that cost her sight. \"I was dead for 20 minutes first and then half an hour, and the lack of oxygen killed my optical nerve.\" The last thing Clements remembered that day was the ambulance coming to get her. \"I couldn't breathe. The next thing I remembered was waking up three days later, blind, in the hospital.\" Her ribs had been broken, when they treated her. Her shoulder was dislocated. She had to undergo nine months of physical treatment. \"It was the hardest time in my life,\" she says. \"Everything changed in my life: distance, smell, and sound. My kids didn't sound the same. My husband didn't sound the same too. I didn't know my home. It took me three months to find the coffee table.\" Once a month, a teacher from the Virginia Center for the Blind came to her home in Woodbridge, about 40 kilometers from Washington. But Clements was eager to learn more. So in 2008, she left her husband and sons, to go to the Virginia School for the Blind in Richmond for a nine-month program. \"My plan was to be able to do for my family again, to do what I like to do, cook, clean, make phone calls.\" She learned basic skills like how to walk with a cane, how to listen and how to eat different foods. There were classes in Braille, computer skills and using different gadgets designed for the blind. Graduates of the program are expected to leave with not only life skills, but a marketable skill as well. \"My teacher asked me why I wouldn't do hair. I said, ' Hello. Blind. No, no, no.' I was scared to think I could even do it.\" But gradually, Clements gained confidence and by the time she graduated, had styled 100 heads of hair at the school. \"People from headquarters came, people from the library, students, secretaries, teachers, and friends came. Everybody came and let me do their hair,\" Clements says. Three days a week she leaves home to volunteer at the House of Mercy, a Catholic service organization that provides clothing, food and other support to the poor. Kellie Ross, executive director of the House of Mercy, remembered when Clements first showed up with her friend, Kathy Braga, to offer her help. At first, she had no idea Clements was blind. \"As she started to walk I realized she couldn't see, \" Ross recalls. \"She could have taken that tragic experience of losing her sight and gone inward, but instead she used that experience to help other people who are suffering.\" Clements says she feels blessed to day, five years after her brush with death. \"I thank the Lord every day for my blindness, because I'm alive,\" she says. \"I could have been dead. I'm alive. I'm healthy, and that is what matters.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What happened to Martha Clements Five years ago?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was she without that caused damage to a nerve?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was she alive during that time?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which nerve was damaged?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Badly?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How long was she in treatment?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was anything else injured?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did she have children?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "A husband?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How did they sound?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How long did she attend  a blind school?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was the name of it?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Where was it?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does she do for a living?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How long has she been cutting hair?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is Kathy Braga?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 139, "span_end": 157, "span_text": " losing her vision", "input_text": "she lost her vision", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1552, "span_end": 1572, "span_text": "a pulmonary embolism", "input_text": "a pulmonary embolism", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1666, "span_end": 1672, "span_text": "oxygen", "input_text": "oxygen", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1610, "span_end": 1648, "span_text": "20 minutes first and then half an hour", "input_text": "20 minutes first and then half an hour", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1594, "span_end": 1620, "span_text": "\"I was dead for 20 minutes", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1682, "span_end": 1690, "span_text": " optical", "input_text": "optical", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1672, "span_end": 1696, "span_text": " killed my optical nerve", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1983, "span_end": 1994, "span_text": "nine months", "input_text": "nine months", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1889, "span_end": 1910, "span_text": " ribs had been broken", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1886, "span_end": 1910, "span_text": "Her ribs had been broken", "input_text": "Her ribs were broken", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1935, "span_end": 1962, "span_text": "Her shoulder was dislocated", "input_text": "Her shoulder was dislocated", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 2126, "span_end": 2133, "span_text": "My kids", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 2157, "span_end": 2167, "span_text": "My husband", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 2126, "span_end": 2189, "span_text": "My kids didn't sound the same.

Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two. \n\nHe stood a moment at his casement, looking out into the empty courtyard. From a leaden sky the rain was descending in sheets, and the gargoyle at the end of the eaves overhead was discharging a steady column of water into the yard. Caron shivered with the cold of that gloomy February morning, and turned away from the window. A few moments later he was in Tardivet's bedchamber, vigorously shaking the sleeping Captain. \n\n\"Up, Charlot! Awake!\" he roared in the man's ear. \n\n\"What o'clock?\" he asked with a yawn. Then a sudden groan escaped him, and he put his hand to his head. \"Thousand devils!\" he swore, \"what a headache!\" \n\nBut La Boulaye was not there on any mission of sympathy, nor did he waste words in conveying his news. \n\n\"The coach is gone,\" he announced emphatically. \n\n\"Coach? What coach?\" asked the Captain, knitting his brows. \n\n\"What coach?\" echoed La Boulaye testily. \"How many coaches were there? Why, the Bellecour coach; the coach with the treasure.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "what did the coach have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what had happened to him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who announced this?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "to who?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what's his name?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "and what does La Boulaye call him?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "was it a cold morning?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what month was it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "was it snowing?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "then?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what was releasing water?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "was it in his room?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "where was the water flowing?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "was the hotel noisy?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what is the quietness described as?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "why did he get up so early?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "and did he get out of bed right away?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what is his first name?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what was wrong with the captain?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1475, "span_end": 1503, "span_text": "the coach with the treasure.", "input_text": "treasure", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1266, "span_end": 1312, "span_text": "\"The coach is gone,\" he announced emphatically", "input_text": "he was gone", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1161, "span_end": 1175, "span_text": "But La Boulaye", "input_text": "La Boulaye", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1316, "span_end": 1354, "span_text": "\"Coach?

Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. \n\nIn the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World War\u00a0II. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years.

With a 2013 Census-estimated population of 1.1 million the Capital District is the third-most populous metropolitan region in the state and 38th in the United States. \n\nFortune 500 companies with offices in Albany include American Express, J.P. Morgan and Chase, Merrill Lynch, General Electric, Verizon, Goldman Sachs, International Paper, and Key Bank. In the 21st century, the Capital District has emerged as a major anchor of Tech Valley, the moniker describing the technologically-focused region of eastern New York State. \n\nThis was the first European settlement in the state. It was settled by Dutch colonists who in 1614, built Fort Nassau for fur trading and Fort Orange in 1624. They formed successful relations with both the Mahican and the Mohawk peoples, two major Native American nations in the region. The fur trade attracted settlers who founded a village called Beverwijck near Fort Orange. In 1664 the English took over the Dutch settlements, renaming the city as Albany, in honor of the then Duke of Albany, the future James II of England and James VII of Scotland. The city was officially chartered in 1686 under English rule. It became the capital of New York State in 1797, following the United States gaining independence in the American Revolutionary War. Albany is one of the oldest surviving settlements of the original British thirteen colonies, and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States. Its charter is possibly the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the Western Hemisphere.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are some Fortune 500 companies with offices in Albany?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What state is it the capital of?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What river was it developed on the bank of?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was it first settled by?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When was this?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Were there any other european colonies in the state at the time?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did it become the capital?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How does it rank in poulation with other cities in the U.S.?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And what about in it's state?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is notable about the cities charter?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Is it possible it's the longest-running in the western hemisphere?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is it's population according to the 2010 census?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What other districts encompass the Capital district of New York State?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When did the English take over rule from the Dutch of the city?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 779, "span_end": 910, "span_text": "American Express, J.P.

In all those twelve weeks of that most trying of all sessions he had not once gone into the street, and he had been less than ever common in the eyes of men. Twice a day he had descended to the dining room for a simple meal--that was all; and fewer had gained entrance to Room Number 7 this session than ever before. \n\nThere is a river that flows by the capital, a wide and gentle river bordered by green meadows and fringed with willows; higher up, if you go far enough, a forest comes down to the water on the western side.

But Jethro was thinking of another scene,--of a granite-ribbed pasture on Coniston Mountain that swings in limitless space, from either end of which a man may step off into eternity. William Wetherell, in one of his letters, had described that place as the Threshold of the Nameless Worlds, and so it had seemed to Jethro in the years of his desolation.

He happens to be 12 years old. \n\nFrom an early age, Jake showed an extraordinary interest in stars. When he was 3, his parents took him to a space observatory. He tried to learn as much as he could about astronomy. Jake's IQ measured remarkably high at 170. \n\nAs a baby, Jake was found out with Asperser's syndrome, a form of autism . Autism causes difficulties in communication and social abilities. People with autism may also have strong interests--like Jake's interest in the stars at a young age. \n\nThe symptoms of autism can range from mild to extremely severe. Asperser's is one of the milder forms of autism. Sometimes people with Asperser's, like Jake, develop extremely advanced skills in science, music or art. \n\nWhen Jake was in elementary school, his parents worried that the effects of his Asperser's were worsening. He became quiet. _ So a doctor recommended that Jake's parents let him study more advanced subjects, like math and physics. \n\nJake's mother asked an astronomy professor to let Jake sit in on his class. Now, Jake studies advanced sciences like electromagnetic physics at IUPUI. \n\nBut Jake thinks it's important to have a normal life too. He likes to play Guitar Hero with his friends and watch science fiction movies. He also enjoys playing classical music on the piano.But for Jake, studying physics is the most important thing. Jake's professor, John Ross, is working on getting a large sum of money for him to do research at the university. \n\nDoctors have said Jake's autism symptoms have lessened over time. Still, Jake proudly refers to himself as an \"Aspy\", or someone with Asperser's. In an interview with his university student newspaper, he said, \"I think the autism is the reason I'm even at IUPUI.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How old is Jake?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Whose theory might have a few mistakes?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is Jake's last name?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What school is he attending?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is Jake at a normal age to be attending there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How old is he?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "At what age did he first go to the space observatory?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who took him there?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Does he have a high IQ?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Does Jake have a medical issue?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is the name of the medical issue?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is it mild or extremely severe?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What skills do people with it sometimes develop?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Does Jake think it is important to have a normal life?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What game does he like to play?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Does he have friends?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How does Jake refer to himself?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What theory is Jake working on?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What does Autism cause difficulties with?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 335, "span_end": 368, "span_text": " He happens to be 12 years old. \n", "input_text": "12", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 26, "span_end": 64, "span_text": "Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity", "input_text": "Albert Einstein's", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 92, "span_end": 109, "span_text": "and Jake Barnett ", "input_text": "Barnett", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 170, "span_end": 220, "span_text": " Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis", "input_text": "Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 336, "span_end": 367, "span_text": "He happens to be 12 years old.

At the age of three months, Lee Hoi Chuen, his wife Grace and baby Bruce returned to Hong Kong where Bruce would be raised until the age of 18. Probably because of the long ocean voyage and the change in climates, Bruce was not a strong child in his very early years, a condition that would change when he took up the study of kung fu at the age of 13. At the age of 13, Bruce was introduced to Master Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. For five years Bruce studied diligently and became very proficient. Regarding Yip Man as a master teacher and wise man, Bruce respected him greatly and frequently visited with him in later years. When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \"enemies\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one's honor through fighting. In high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship. At the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically.

The castle of Nixar, being carelessly guarded, was taken by surprise and its garrison put to the sword. The old warrior raged with sanguinary fury about the whole frontier, attacking convoys, slaying, wounding, and making prisoners, and coming by surprise upon the Christians wherever they were off their guard. \n\nCarlos de Biedma, alcayde of the fortress of Culla, confiding in the strength of its walls and towers and in its difficult situation, being built on the summit of a lofty hill and surrounded by precipices, ventured to absent himself from his post. He was engaged to be married to a fair and noble lady of Baeza, and repaired to that city to celebrate his nuptials, escorted by a brilliant array of the best horsemen of his garrison. Apprised of his absence, the vigilant El Zagal suddenly appeared before Culla with a powerful force, stormed the town sword in hand, fought the Christians from street to street, and drove them with great slaughter to the citadel.

The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity. \n\nThe Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936. Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\". The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called \"Pact of Steel\", with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan. \n\nAt its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of Europe, North Africa, and East Asia. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with a bit more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war. The term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's \"Germania Repubblica\" that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (\"non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino\").

She and other Christians from the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas came halfway across the country to say marriage is defined by Holy Bible. \"The pattern is one man and one woman for life to have children who you raise in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,\" she said. David Schwartz, a traditional Jew, believes every human being has free choice and the power to rule over their desires. He considers homosexual desire to be wrong. \"There's one God in heaven and earth, and he has ordered for all mankind that they should limit their affections to relationships between a man and a woman in the context of marriage,\" he said. Douglas Robinson and his partner of 25 years, Michael Elsasser, were in the first group to be married in Manhattan. Robinson says the United States allows religious views to coexist with(...) what he believes is a civil right of same-sex marriage. \"You can have different opinions. This is a tent, some people call it a mixture of various different cultures and opinions and the like, so God bless America, and we are proud to be Americans,\" he said. Margie Phelps believes God will punish New York City for permitting what she believes to be moral decay. Meanwhile, Nevin Cohen and Daniel Hernandez showed off their marriage certificate. But they said they will not be going on a honeymoon. They say they need to be at work in New York on Monday.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the topic?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What state is it about?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who allowed it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What day did it begin?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Were there many persons trying to be wed?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How did they handle the situation?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did everyone agree with the legislation?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are there religious reasons for opposing it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which religious organization traveled across the US?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What does the legislation promote for its supporters?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 306, "span_end": 326, "span_text": " homosexual marriage", "input_text": "homosexual marriage", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 30, "span_text": "Homosexual couples in New York", "input_text": "New York", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 74, "span_end": 119, "span_text": "Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a law permitting", "input_text": "Governor Andrew Cuomo", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 276, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "Sunday, the first day of legal homosexual marriage", "input_text": "Sunday", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 236, "span_end": 284, "span_text": "So many couples wanted to be married on Sunday, ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 236, "span_end": 412, "span_text": "So many couples wanted to be married on Sunday, the first day of legal homosexual marriage in New York City, that local officials announced a lottery to determine qualification", "input_text": "a lottery to determine qualification", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 746, "span_end": 810, "span_text": "Margie Phelps announced same-sex marriage as a crime against God", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 770, "span_end": 810, "span_text": "same-sex marriage as a crime against God", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 845, "span_end": 919, "span_text": " Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas came halfway across the country", "input_text": "Westboro Baptist Church", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 551, "span_end": 591, "span_text": "same-sex marriage law supports equality.", "input_text": "equality.", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high24257.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3ias3u3i0fg5lj8qbnvmsvug9r5b2z", "filename": "high4211.txt", "story": "Genzeb Tibeb is very bright.

Its primary competitors are Dish Network and cable television providers. On July 24, 2015, after receiving approval from the United States Federal Communications Commission and United States Department of Justice, AT&T acquired DirecTV in a transaction valued at $48.5 billion. \n\nDirecTV provides television and audio services to subscribers through satellite transmissions. Services include the equivalent of many local television stations, broadcast television networks, subscription television services, satellite radio services, and private video services. Subscribers have access to hundreds of channels, so its competitors are cable television service and other satellite-based services. \n\nMost subscribers use reception antennas which are much smaller than the first generation antennas, which were typically a few yards (meters) across. Advances in antenna technology, including fractal antennas, have allowed a general reduction in antenna size across all industries and applications.

One threw a tomahawk at Dave, but the aim was poor and the weapon buried itself in the log which had sheltered our friends. \n\nBut just at this moment, when all seemed lost, the battleground shifted and instantly thirty or forty English red-coats burst from the woods directly behind the Indians. A volley rang out and four of the redmen pitched forward, shot through the back. Other bullets hit the log behind which our friends lay, but Dave, Henry, and Barringford were not touched. \n\nAttacked so unexpectedly from a new quarter, the Indians appeared dazed. They attempted to turn upon the English soldiers, but when two more were laid low, they fled to one side, where there was a dense growth of walnuts. The soldiers at once made after them, and another skirmish took place in the forest. \n\n\"Are you hurt much, Sam?\" asked Henry, when he had recovered sufficiently to speak. \n\n\"I--I reckon not,\" was the gasped-out answer, after a long silence. Barringford opened his eyes and gazed ruefully at the gun stock which lay at his feet. \"Busted! Well, by gum! Didn't think Old Trusty would do it nohow. Ain't ye ashamed?\" And he shook his head dolefully.

But a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him nearer and nearer to March, when they were to be married, and all the little preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress towards the longed-for day. Two new rooms had been \"run up\" to the old house, for his mother and Seth were to live with them after all. Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he had gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put up with his mother's ways and consent to live with her.

There are many similar dolls on the market in competition with her. Another doll named Bratz, for example, came to life thirteen years ago. She looks more like today's pop stars with heavy makeup and miniskirts. And her company offers more kinds of clothes too. It seems that Barbie has lost her magic among older girls. 'For younger girls, playing with a Barbie is much fun. But when you get older, you want something smarter and more modern,' says Vera Shepherd, a shop assistant in a New York toy store. It is good news that on the international market, Barbie is still No. 1. Although Mattel is selling fewer barbie in the United States these years, sales in other countries are still going up. In January 2009, Mattel opened its first Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can shop, eat, drink or even become _ for their own Barbies. Mattel is planning big celebrations for Barbie's 53rd birthday. She has called Fashion designers from all over the world to make new dresses for Barbie.

A third escaped inmate, Daniel Renwick, 35, was arrested the day after the escape in Rifle, Colorado, where he got in a shootout with police. \n\nDavid Gonzales, the U.S. marshal for Arizona, told CNN that the remaining fugitives are now suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found Wednesday in New Mexico. \n\n\"There was evidence that ties them, our suspects, who escaped from prison, directly to their murders,\" Gonzales told CNN. \n\nGonzales said the fugitives have frequented truck stops and campgrounds. He said McCluskey and Province have \"white supremacist leanings\" and could be looking for \"people who are sympathetic to their cause.\" \n\nYellowstone sits at the northwest corner of Wyoming and extends a short distance into Montana and Idaho, both states where white supremacist groups have attempted to take root.

He was known as \"Alexander the Unifier\" and he renamed the kingdom \"Yugoslavia\" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934.

Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish. At the age of 5, he cooked his first dish of shrimp and broccoli. Taking it for his school lunch, he warmed it up in the school's microwave, while the other kids ate their sandwiches. \"I love to eat, and it started to become more fun to cook than to use a microwave,\" he said. Cooking came easy to Kenny, and he enjoyed adding new ingredients into common dishes. \"It started with a passion and I wanted to know more,\" he said. He began to watch the Food Network and read chef blogs. Last summer, Kenny put his skills to the test by working with his grandmother to cater his uncle's wedding. While she cooked traditional dishes, Kenny wanted to add new to the expected flavors . Now Kenny spends his weekends catering his own events: weddings, birthday parties, baby showers. Kenny's dishes are always a hit. Chef Frederick Mookie Hicks, owner of a catering business, said Kenny's success comes from his ability to multitask in the kitchen. Hicks said he has asked Kenny to cook with him on jobs three times now, and he presents Kenny as a positive example of a passionate chef to the students in his cooking classes. \"He's so vigorous about cooking that he doesn't let anything stop him,\" Hicks said. \"I knew in the first five minutes of working with the kid that he is something special.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was Kenny's last name?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did he enjoy doing?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did he start his own business?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was it called?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What position did he hold at the club as his school?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where was the school?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How old was Kenny when he got that position?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which year of school was he in?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How did he obtain his passion for cooking?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did he learn from them?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What tips he did get?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How old was he when he started cooking?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was did he cook first?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Where did he eat it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What TV station did he watch?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was his first catering job?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Where did they work together?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who made the traditional dishes?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did Kenny want to do?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What makes Kenny successful in the kitchen?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 47, "span_end": 57, "span_text": "Seals-Nutt", "input_text": "Seals-Nutt", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 958, "span_end": 985, "span_text": "Cooking came easy to Kenny,", "input_text": "Cooking", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 344, "span_end": 373, "span_text": "pened his own food company, c", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 334, "span_end": 392, "span_text": " He also opened his own food company, called Modern Fusion", "input_text": "Modern Fusion", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 290, "span_end": 333, "span_text": "vice president of his school's cooking club", "input_text": "Vice President", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 225, "span_end": 271, "span_text": " high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina,", "input_text": "North Carolina", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 189, "span_end": 334, "span_text": "Kenny, 16, reached his third year of high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina, US, he had become vice president of his school's cooking club.", "input_text": "16", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 211, "span_end": 253, "span_text": " third year of high school at Hickory Grov", "input_text": "Third", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 418, "span_end": 484, "span_text": "his love of cooking by watching his mother, and his grandmother, w", "input_text": "watching his mother and grandmother", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 522, "span_end": 578, "span_text": "Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 578, "span_end": 681, "span_text": "how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish.

(This is your SPOILER ALERT.) \n\n\"The Closer\" series finale brought closure to Deputy Chief Johnson's career, as she faced off with her long-running arch-nemesis, the serial rapist Philip Stroh (Billy Burke). Then Johnson abruptly accepted a new job (something like chief of bureau of investigations L.A. liason officer in the D.A.'s office -- it sounded like the longest-titled cushy job possible) and lit out, munching a signature bit of junk food. \n\nOver the years, \"The Closer\" had become a light-comedy crime show with heavy-handed humor performed not just by Sedgwick but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to \"Major Crimes,\" especially G.W. Bailey, whose slow burns have become endless fuming, and, only by contrast to a lesser extent, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, and Phillip P. Keene. (I've always found it interesting that Denison and Chan are veterans of two, need I say superior, Michael Mann TV shows, Crime Story and Robbery Homicide Division -- indeed, many of Chan's gestures and body language when he enters a crime scene strongly echo his moves in RHD, and I'd bet that's where he picked up those good habits, from Mann's heavily-researched series.)

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What type of system is the US dollar based on?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is the Spanish dollar the same system?", "turn_id": 2},

But 38.6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e-books. This is a 17.7 percent increase from 2010. Many experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading --reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book. Zhao jianmin, a professor at Shanghai University, said fragmented reading was part of modern life. \"The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book,\" he said. \"So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend\" Fragmented reading has its advantages. People can enjoy large amounts of information, knowledge and entertainment in a short time. Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading. However, some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way. Xu Guosheng, at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read.

Gbagbo defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner. \n\nA violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December. Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\nAndris Piebalgs, EU commissioner for development, announced the recovery package on Tuesday. \n\n\"We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development,\" he said. \n\nThe funding will provide support to ensure basic needs for citizens such as health, water, sanitation and to support the agricultural sector, Piebalgs said in a statement.

At an Edison company party in New York, Ford had his first chance to meet his hero Edison and was able to explain his new automobile to the great inventor. _ Young man, that's the thing! You have it! Your car is self-contained and carries its own power plant.\" Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one. \n\nThe words comforted Ford greatly, who immediately set out building a second car which was to become the Model-T.6.The two men became f'ast friends and would go on camping trips together.When Edison later became limited to a wheelchair, Ford brought an extra one to his house so they could race.At the 50th anniversary of the invention of light-bulb, Ford honored Edison.When Edison spoke, he ended his speech directed at Ford:\" As to Henry Ford, words fail to express my feelings.I can only say that he is my friend.\" Therefore it is no surprise that Ford wanted something to remember Edison by after he passed away in 1931. \n\nOnce, Ford asked Thomas Edison's son Charles to sit by the dying inventor's bedside and hold a test tube next to his father's mouth to catch his final breath. Ford was a man with many strange behaviors( as was Edison)including some interest in reanimation and spiritualism and some say that he was attempting to catch Edison's soul as it escaped his body in hopes of later bringing the inventor back to life. \n\nThe test tube itself didn't turn up until 1950 when it was listed in the Ford possessions after Clara Ford's passing away, and then lost again until 1978 when it was discovered in an exhibit Entitled \"Henry Ford-A Personal History\" in the Henry Ford Museum.It would then be discovered that the tube was labeled \"Edison's Last Breath\". \n\nThere is a further mystery of this \"last breath\" test tube. It would seem as if Edison had quite a last breath indeed, as the Edison Estate holds a collection of 42 test tubes all supposedly containing Edison's last breath. \n\nRegardless of the excitement over the last breath, the test tube is quite touching in its meaning.Although both men were known for all sorts of poor behavior towards .their loved ones and mistreatment of employees, between them at least, there was clearly a deep respect and admiration.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did Ford turn 33?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where was he working?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Had Edison considered the gas engine as a vehicular power source?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What source had he considered?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Were Ford and Edison companions?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When did Edison die?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do some people believe Ford tried to collect from Edison?", "turn_id": 7}], "answers": [{"span_start": 229, "span_end": 258, "span_text": "In 1896 Ford was thirty-three", "input_text": "1896", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 229, "span_end": 299, "span_text": "In 1896 Ford was thirty-three and, though still working for Edison Co.", "input_text": "Edison Co.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 653, "span_end": 811, "span_text": "Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 653, "span_end": 812, "span_text": "Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one.", "input_text": "Electricity", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 932, "span_end": 961, "span_text": " two men became f'ast friends", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1399, "span_end": 1440, "span_text": " Edison by after he passed away in 1931.

He was right. Most men at twenty-five are satisfied with their jobs. They have closed their minds to all new ideas; they have stopped to grow. The minute a man stops to grow -no matter what his years -that minute he begins to be old. On the other hand, the really great man never grows old. Goethe passed away at eighty-three, and finished his only a few years earlier; Gladstone took up a new language when he was seventy. Laplace, the astronomer, was still at work when death caught up with him at seventy-eight. He died crying, \"What we know is nothing; what we do not know is immense (extremely large).\" And there you have the real answer to the question, \"When is a man old?\" Laplace at seventy-eight died young. He was still unsatisfied, still sure that he had a lot to learn.

Buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation's endowment, but effectively work as a matching contribution, doubling the Foundation's annual giving: \"Buffett's gift came with three conditions for the Gates foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year's Berkshire gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets. Buffett gave the foundation two years to abide by the third requirement.\" The Gates Foundation received 5% (500,000) of the shares in July 2006 and will receive 5% of the remaining earmarked shares in the July of each following year (475,000 in 2007, 451,250 in 2008).

He could also lose himself in a game of golf, where his somewhat flexible interpretation of the rules could at times drive his partners crazy. Obama's predecessor also knows how to relax. Fishing is in the Bush family DNA: for blue sharks off the coast of Maine or anything with fins, almost anywhere else. George W. Bush also relaxed as president by jogging and clearing brush on his Texas ranch. Since leaving office, he has become an active mountain biker and, more recently, has taken up painting. Obama tends to take a winter break in Hawaii, where he was born and raised, and a summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In between, he plays basketball every couple of weeks and has been known to do some skeet shooting at Camp David.

They meant so much: so many thousand hours of suppressed irritation, so many baffled longings and earnest efforts to bring their natures together. They were the supreme, quiet evidence of the divergence of two lives--that slow divergence which had been far from being wilful, and was the more hopeless in that it had been so gradual and so gentle. They had never really had a quarrel, having enlightened views of marriage; but they had smiled. They had smiled so often through so many years that no two people in the world could very well be further from each other.

For eighty-four days ,he set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So unlucky was he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend , Manolin , forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more profitable boat On the eighty-fifth day ,the fisherman set out into the open sea to go fishing. At noon ,a big Marlin took hold of one of the lines, but the fish was far too big for him to handle. \n\nSantiago let the fish have enough line, so that it wouIdn9t break his pole; but he and his boat were dragged out to sea for three days. Finally ,the fish grew tired. Santiago killed it Even this final victory didn't end his journey. He was still far, far out to sea. To make matters worse, Santiago dragged the Marlin behind the boat and the fish blood attracted sharks. \n\nSantiago did his best to beat the sharks away ,but his efforts were not enough, The sharks ate the flesh off the Marlin ,and Santiago was left with only the bones. Santiago was tired out He got back home with nothing to show for his pains but the skeletal remains of a large Marlin. Even with just the bare remains of the fish, the experience changed him, and charged the opinions others had of him. Manolin , who had been worried over the old man's absence, was moved to tears when he found Santiago safe in his bed, When the old man woke ,the two agreed to fish as partners once more. \n\nWith Santiago5S struggle to catch the Marlin and his journey home ,Santiago's courage was obvious as he faced challenges that just didn't seem to end.

If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Net speak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great. Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Net speak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Net speak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurnberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \"Kids who are now doing text messages, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\" Linguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Net speakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Net speak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway.

Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.

Her mom, Jaimee, kept her eye on the little girl from a window. At about 4 p.m., Jocelyn walked around the corner of the building to get her bicycle. However, half an hour later, she disappeared. Jaimee called 911. A short time later, police officers and firefighters crowded inthe area, blocking streets and searching the neighborhood. Officers handed out photos of the girl wearing thick-framed glasses. Temar Boggs, 15, a school athlete in track, was with some friends moving a couch into the apartment of his elderly neighbor when one officer approached him and asked if he'd seen Jocelyn. Unfortunately, none of them had seen her. A little bit later, Temar and his friends went to check out the situation. By 6:30 p.m., Jocelyn had been missing for more than two hours, and the search team was worried that the sun would set before she was found. Just at that moment, Temar felt an intense emotion that he was going to find her. He and his friend Chris Garcia, 13, rode alongside, simply keeping a sharp eye out as they circled around. Then Temar spotted a car circling around, as if the driver were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. Temar cycled close and made eye contact with the man behind the wheel, an older guy wearing a red-and-white striped shirt, and saw a tiny blond girl in the passenger seat. Temar instantly realized it must be the missing girl. The boys cycled after the car, but the driver kept moving, winding his way through the neighborhood. Finally, the driver had to park the car ahead of them and pushed open the passenger-side door. A girl slipped out of the car. It was Jocelyn. Temar got off his bike, and carried her to the police.

It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of \u22124.6 \u2013 bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8\u00b0. \n\nVenus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's \"sister planet\" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of , even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light.

Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With 2,877,215 residents in , it is also the country's most populated comune. It is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the center of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4.3 million residents. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. \n\nRome's history spans more than 2,500 years. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines.

The World Health Organization(WHO) warns that millions of people are dying every year from indoor air pollution. The WHO finds that poor cooking, heating and lighting technologies are killing millions of people each year. \n\nIndoor air pollution results from the use of dangerous fuels and cook stoves in the home. WHO officials say nearly three billion people are unable to use clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. And they say more than seven million people die from exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution each year. Of that number, the WHO says about 4.3 million people die from household air pollution given off by simple biomass and coal stoves. \n\nThese findings show that the home use of poisonous fuels is to blame for many of these deaths. These fuels include wood, coal, animal waste and so on. Carlos Dora is Coordinator in the WHO' s Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. He says people should not use unprocessed coal and kerosene fuel indoors. He says opening a window or door to let out the harmful air will not correct the situation. It will only pollute the outdoors. \"New technologies and clean fuels can rid people of this problem.\" \n\nThe United Nations found that more than 95 percent of families in sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid fuels for cooking.

Then he paused: \"But you'll always be limited by the size of the wheels. And so far no one has invented a folding wheel.\" It was a rare -- indeed unique -- occasion when I was able to put Ritchie right. A 19th-century inventor, William Henry James Grout, did in fact design a folding wheel. His bike, predictably named the Grout Portable, had a frame that split into two and a larger wheel that could be separated into four pieces. All the bits fitted into Grout's Wonderful Bag, a leather case. Grout's aim: to solve the problems of carrying a bike on a train. Now doesn't that sound familiar? Grout intended to find a way of making a bike small enough for train travel: his bike was a huge beast. And importantly, the design of early bicycles gave him an advantage: in Grout's day, tyres were solid, which made the business of splitting a wheel into four separate parts relatively simple. You couldn't do the same with a wheel fitted with a one-piece inflated tyre. So, in a 21st-century context, is the idea of the folding wheel dead? It is not. A British design engineer, Duncan Fitzsimons, has developed a wheel that can be squashed into something like a slender ellipse . Throughout, the tyre remains inflated. Will the young Fitzsimons's folding wheel make it into production? I haven't the foggiest idea. But his inventiveness shows two things. First, people have been saying for more than a century that bike design has reached its limit, except for gradual advances. It's as silly a concept now as it was 100 years ago: there's plenty still to go for. Second, it is in the field of folding bikes that we are seeing the most interesting inventions. You can buy a folding bike for less than PS1,000 that can be knocked down so small that it can be carried on a plane -- minus wheels, of course -- as hand baggage.

They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries. \n\nTop athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. \"Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,\" he explains. \"Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?\" \n\nThe students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons. \n\nCollege athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school. \n\nThe money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. \"Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,\" Massett explains. \n\nIn addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. \"Most students do not become professional athletes after college.

Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with \"goodness\" or \"rightness\". \n\nMoral philosophy includes moral ontology, or the origin of morals, as well as moral epistemology, or knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including deontological ethical systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and normative ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states that: \"One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.\" \n\nImmorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles. \n\nEthics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality. The word \"ethics\" is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.\" Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially deontological ethics, sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: \"Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct, reserving ethics for the more Aristotelian approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a virtue, and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "where does the word morality come from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Latin words that mean what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what word is used interchangeably with morality?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what is that known as?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "are ethics and morality mostly the same?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is morality restricted to?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "based on what?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what approach are ethics reserved for?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "influenced by who?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "based on what concept?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 10, "span_end": 25, "span_text": "from the Latin ", "input_text": "from the Latin", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 29, "span_end": 63, "span_text": "manner, character, proper behavior", "input_text": "manner, character, proper behavior", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1355, "span_end": 1361, "span_text": "ethics", "input_text": "ethics", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1259, "span_end": 1276, "span_text": " moral philosophy", "input_text": "moral philosophy", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1345, "span_end": 1531, "span_text": "The word \"ethics\" is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.\"", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1777, "span_end": 1817, "span_text": "to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant", "input_text": "to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1824, "span_end": 1888, "span_text": " on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct,", "input_text": "on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct,", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1944, "span_end": 1963, "span_text": "practical reasoning", "input_text": "practical reasoning", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1919, "span_end": 1931, "span_text": "Aristotelian", "input_text": "Aristotelian", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1974, "span_end": 1996, "span_text": "the notion of a virtue", "input_text": "the notion of a virtue", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Morality.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "373erpl3yo8mlpjsqz18tx8arycrtr", "filename": "BBC_News_Online.txt", "story": "BBC News Online is the website of BBC News, the division of the BBC responsible for newsgathering and production.

It covers and has a population of around 240,000. Its capital is Sukhumi. The separatist Abkhazian polity, formally the Republic of Abkhazia or Apsny, is recognised only by Russia and a small number of other countries. While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia, the Georgian government, the United Nations and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia part of Georgia, whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia. \n\nThe status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian\u2013Abkhazian conflict and Georgia\u2013Russia relations. The region enjoyed autonomy within Soviet Georgia at the time when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s. Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz\u2014the region's \"titular ethnicity\"\u2014and Georgians\u2014the largest single ethnic group at that time\u2014culminated in the 1992\u20131993 War in Abkhazia which resulted in Georgia's loss of control of most of Abkhazia, the \"de facto\" independence of Abkhazia, and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia. Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations, the dispute remains unresolved. The long-term presence of a United Nations Observer Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping force failed to prevent the flare-up of violence on several occasions. In August 2008, Abkhaz forces fought against Georgian forces during the Russo-Georgian War, which led to the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia, the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement, and the termination of the UN mission. On 28 August 2008, the Parliament of Georgia declared Abkhazia a Russian-occupied territory.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is on the eastern coast of the black sea?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is it called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what else borders it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is it south of?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And northwest of where?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many people live there?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is it's capital?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who considers it to be part of them?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who is under conflict?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was the ceasefire?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 78, "span_text": "Abkhazia is a partially recognised state on the eastern coast of the Black Sea", "input_text": "a partially recognised state", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 78, "span_text": "Abkhazia is a partially recognised state on the eastern coast of the Black Sea", "input_text": "Abkhazia", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 41, "span_end": 132, "span_text": "on the eastern coast of the Black Sea and the south-western flank of the Caucasus Mountains", "input_text": "Caucasus Mountains", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 150, "span_text": "south of Russia ", "input_text": "Russia", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "south of Russia and northwest of Georgia proper.", "input_text": "Georgia proper", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 182, "span_end": 231, "span_text": " It covers and has a population of around 240,000", "input_text": "around 240,000", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 233, "span_end": 256, "span_text": "Its capital is Sukhumi.", "input_text": "Sukhumi.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 513, "span_end": 648, "span_text": "world's governments consider Abkhazia part of Georgia, whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia. \n", "input_text": "Georgia", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 881, "span_end": 972, "span_text": "Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz\u2014the region's \"titular ethnicity\"\u2014and Georgians", "input_text": "the Abkhaz and Georgians", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1237, "span_end": 1274, "span_text": "Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement ", "input_text": "1994", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Abkhazia.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3k772s5np8b77cns4z0jg7631a3hew", "filename": "cnn_cf3f7388c3b51980ead39a8e701c7a4860d9f77c.story", "story": "(CNN)Where do you go from here? \n\nThe fourth season of \"Game of Thrones\" saw massive battles, major deaths (Tywin!) and White Walkers, but what can fans expect Sunday as we head into a fifth season of one of the most popular shows in HBO history? \n\nIt's the most high-profile premiere yet, airing simultaneously in 170 countries for the first time.

City officials in San Francisco introduced the app to try to reduce traffic jams in the city, but some say it raises safety concerns. \n\nIn this city, drivers searching for parking spots lead to 30 percent of all downtown jams, city officials think. Now San Francisco has found a solution--a phone app for spot-seekers that displays information about areas with available spaces. The system, introduced last month, relies on wireless sensors fixed in streets and city garages that can tell within seconds if a spot has opened up. \n\nMonique Soltani, a TV reporter, said she and her sister spent 25 minutes on Friday trying to park. \"We were praying to the parking god that we'd find a spot,\" she said. \"If we had the app, we would not have to pray to the parking god.\" But the system could come with serious consequences. \n\nSome people say that drivers searching for parking could end up focusing on their phones, not the road. \"It could be really distracting ,\" said Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. \n\nCity officials acknowledge the potential problem. They are urging drivers to pull over before they use the city's iPhone app, or to do so before they leave home. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said safety could actually improve if drivers quickly found a spot instead of circling and getting frustrated. \n\nSan Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots and 12,250 spots in city garages. If spaces in an area open up, the sensors communicate wirelessly with computers that in turn make the information available to app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency. On the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places (blue) and which are full (red). \n\nMore than 12,000 people have downloaded San Francisco's app, which is available now only for the iPhone but which city officials say they hope to bring to all similar devices. \n\nWhen it is started up, the city's parking app warns drivers not to use the system while in motion. But safety advocates said that might not be sufficient. After all, they say, texting while driving is illegal in California and in many states, but a number of surveys, including one by the Pew Research Center, show that many Americans do it anyway. \n\nElizabeth Stampe, executive director of Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy group, said she hoped the new parking app would lead to fewer accidents. \n\n\"It's an innovative idea,\" she said. \"The safe way for people to use the device is for them to pull over, which they know they should do. The question is whether they will.\" \n\nBut Ms. Soltani, the TV reporter, said using the app would probably join the group of activities already performed by drivers. \n\n\"We're already looking at Google Maps and Facebook on the phone while we drive,\" she said. \"Aren't we always looking at something on our phone, or changing the radio, or drinking coffee? You're always slightly distracted when you're driving.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How long did it take Monique to park?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is her profession?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is Daniel Simon's concern about the app?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where does he work?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does he teach?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What does the app hope to reduce?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What percentage of jams are caused by parking?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "According to whom?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many sensors has San Francisco installed?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long does it take to transmit an opening to the app?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "According to who?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Which color indicates a parking spot is open?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is the app available on Android?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How many people have downloaded it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is texting and driving legal in California?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What organization says that drivers might do it anyway?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What might they be doing, according to Ms. Soltani?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What other apps does she think users look at while they're driving?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 619, "span_end": 717, "span_text": "Monique Soltani, a TV reporter, said she and her sister spent 25 minutes on Friday trying to park.", "input_text": "25 minutes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 619, "span_end": 649, "span_text": "Monique Soltani, a TV reporter", "input_text": "TV reporter", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1014, "span_end": 1067, "span_text": "\"It could be really distracting ,\" said Daniel Simons", "input_text": "It could be really distracting", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1054, "span_end": 1127, "span_text": "Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. \n", "input_text": "University of Illinois.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1054, "span_end": 1094, "span_text": "Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology", "input_text": "f psychology", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 141, "span_end": 169, "span_text": " try to reduce traffic jams ", "input_text": "traffic jams", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 259, "span_end": 313, "span_text": " parking spots lead to 30 percent of all downtown jams", "input_text": "30 percent of all downtown jams", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 282, "span_end": 336, "span_text": "30 percent of all downtown jams, city officials think.", "input_text": "city officials", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1492, "span_end": 1546, "span_text": "San Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots", "input_text": "7,000", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1668, "span_end": 1734, "span_text": " turn make the information available to app users within a minute,", "input_text": "within a minute", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1707, "span_end": 1779, "span_text": " app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency.", "input_text": "Mr. Ford", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1781, "span_end": 1871, "span_text": "n the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places (blue) and which are full (red). \n", "input_text": "blue", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1960, "span_end": 2046, "span_text": " for the iPhone but which city officials say they hope to bring to all similar devices", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1872, "span_end": 1888, "span_text": "More than 12,000", "input_text": "More than 12,000", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 2225, "span_end": 2272, "span_text": " texting while driving is illegal in California", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 2293, "span_end": 2399, "span_text": "but a number of surveys, including one by the Pew Research Center, show that many Americans do it anyway.

People think: \"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. \n\nEarlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. \n\nWith a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. \n\nThe lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. \n\nThe novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\" Babel commented.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the name of the book?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Which year it was published?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many families in the storyline?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What social class they belonged to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Of which country?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is there any tv miniseries about it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Which new outlet made that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When it will be aired?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did Hemingway have a high opinion about the novel?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Anyone else commented about the novel?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Going back to the story - how many kid Rostov had?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where they young?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did Rostov do well financially?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What was one of the kid's name?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who was the older brother?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who did he love?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Is Vera getting married?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Whom?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 228, "span_end": 241, "span_text": "War and Peace", "input_text": "War and Peace", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 243, "span_end": 247, "span_text": "1869", "input_text": "1869", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 277, "span_end": 302, "span_text": "five upper-class families", "input_text": "five", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 282, "span_end": 302, "span_text": "upper-class families", "input_text": "upper", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 306, "span_end": 312, "span_text": "Russia", "input_text": "Russia", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 532, "span_end": 635, "span_text": "USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 611, "span_end": 614, "span_text": "BBC", "input_text": "BBC", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 625, "span_end": 634, "span_text": "next year", "input_text": "next year", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1610, "span_end": 1707, "span_text": "Ernest Hemingway wrote: \"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\"", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1844, "span_end": 1924, "span_text": "\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\" Babel commented.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1908, "span_end": 1924, "span_text": "Babel commented.", "input_text": "Babel", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 830, "span_end": 851, "span_text": "four teenage children", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 835, "span_end": 852, "span_text": "teenage children.", "input_text": "teenagers", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1166, "span_end": 1171, "span_text": "Petya", "input_text": "Petya", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1128, "span_end": 1171, "span_text": "The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya", "input_text": "Nine", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1195, "span_end": 1202, "span_text": "Nikolai", "input_text": "Nikolai", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1208, "span_end": 1249, "span_text": "his heart set on fighting for his country", "input_text": "his country", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1047, "span_end": 1127, "span_text": "The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1102, "span_end": 1127, "span_text": "a German-Russian officer.", "input_text": "a German-Russian officer.", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high18905.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3aapld8ucch9wv5puupeft644nzht1", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/John Galsworthy___The Freelands.txt/CHAPTER XVI_0ee28fdb6afdba84ca0c84052670f4373471ef9ae76f2c0d4fd84d4", "story": "CHAPTER XVI \n\nFelix (nothing if not modern) had succumbed already to the feeling that youth ruled the roost.

No! Sheila was not mild. Rich-colored, downright of speech, with her mane of short hair, she was a no less startling companion. The smile of Felix had never been more whimsically employed than during that ten-day visit. The evening John Freeland came to dinner was the highwater mark of his alarmed amusement. Mr. Cuthcott, also bidden, at Nedda's instigation, seemed to take a mischievous delight in drawing out those two young people in face of their official uncle.

Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. \"Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part.\" Tavella says. \"Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.\" The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.\" He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from.

During the last season the house in Bruton Street had been empty. He and his wife were then mourning their lost son, and there was no place for the gaiety of London in their lives. Sir Harry was still thinking of his great loss. He was always thinking of the boy who was gone, who had been the apple of his eye, his one great treasure, the only human being in the world whose superior importance to his own he had been ready, in his heart of hearts, to admit; but it was needful that the outer signs of sorrow should be laid aside, and Emily Hotspur was taken up to London, in order that she might be suited with a husband. That, in truth, was the reason of their going. Neither Sir Harry nor Lady Elizabeth would have cared to leave Cumberland had there been no such cause. They would have been altogether content to remain at home had Emily been obedient enough in the winter to accept the hand of the suitor proposed for her. \n\nThe house was opened in Bruton Street, and Lord Alfred came to see them. So also did Cousin George. There was no reason why Cousin George should not come. Indeed, had he not done so, he must have been the most ungracious of cousins. He came, and found Lady Elizabeth and Emily at home. Emily told him that they were always there to receive visitors on Sundays after morning church, and then he came again. She had made no such communication to Lord Alfred, but then perhaps it would have been hardly natural that she should have done so. Lady Elizabeth, in a note which she had occasion to write to Lord Alfred, did tell him of her custom on a Sunday afternoon; but Lord Alfred took no such immediate advantage of the offer as did Cousin George.

Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley, which contains the San Joaquin Valley. It is approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of Los Angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital, Sacramento, or 185 miles (300 km) south of San Francisco.

after becoming the victim of an alleged Internet blackmail scam have heightened concerns in Britain over online abuse. \n\nDaniel Perry, from Dunfermline, was reportedly the victim of blackmailers who recorded his interactions via Skype with a person he believed was an American girl his own age. \n\nThey then threatened to show his family the footage unless he paid up, UK media reports say. Instead, the 17-year-old jumped from a bridge last month. \n\nNews of his death comes on the heels of outrage over the suicide of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, from Leicestershire in England.

Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. \n\nThe Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. For example, the cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. In recent years, Arctic sea ice decline has been caused by global warming. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants and human societies. Arctic land is bordered by the subarctic. \n\nThe word Arctic comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (\"arktikos\"), \"near the Bear, northern\" and that from the word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\"arktos\"), meaning bear.

After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group's on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn't just something that happened in Australia. It's world history. \n\nThe full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia-where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part-other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia . In the US and Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling. \n\nUnder the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death-probably by a deadly injection or pill-to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two doctors. After a cooling off period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition.

The outer room had no regular windows, only some chinks or loopholes, through which a certain amount of light could come; but these were stopped up with straw, for the Mexicans are a chilly people; and as the door was always open, plenty of light came in through it.

MyNetworkTV began operations on September 5, 2006 with an initial affiliate lineup covering about 96% of the country, most of which consisted of stations that were former affiliates of The WB and UPN that did not join the successor of those two networks, The CW. \n\nOn September 28, 2009, following disappointment with the network's results, MyNetworkTV dropped its status as a television network and transitioned into a programming service, similar to Ion Television, relying mainly on repeats of recent broadcast and cable series. \n\nMyNetworkTV arose from the January 2006 announcement of the launch of The CW, a television network formed by CBS Corporation and Time Warner which essentially combined programming from The WB and UPN onto the scheduling model of the former of the two predecessors. As a result of several deals earlier in the decade, Fox Television Stations owned several UPN affiliates, including the network's three largest stations: WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey (part of the New York City market), KCOP-TV in Los Angeles and WPWR-TV in Chicago. Fox had acquired WWOR and KCOP after purchasing most of the television holdings of UPN's founding partner Chris-Craft Industries, while WPWR was purchased by the company in 2003 from Newsweb Corporation. Despite concerns about UPN's future that came up after Fox purchased the Chris-Craft stations, UPN signed three-year affiliation renewals with the network's Fox-owned affiliates in 2003. That agreement's pending expiration, along with those involving other broadcasting companies, in 2006 as well as persistent financial losses for both it and The WB gave CBS Corporation (the parent company of UPN) and Time Warner (parent of The WB) the rare opportunity to merge their respective struggling networks into The CW.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did MyNetworkTV begin?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How much of the country did they cover?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "DId the network have promising results?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did it remain as a TV network in 2009?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did it become instead?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "True or False: During that time, it aired original content.", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did it mainly air?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was one of Fox's 3 largest stations?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And another?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "And the last?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was UPN's founding partner?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who bought their stations?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 804, "span_end": 843, "span_text": "MyNetworkTV arose from the January 2006", "input_text": "January 2006", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 353, "span_end": 387, "span_text": "covering about 96% of the country,", "input_text": "about 96%", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 556, "span_end": 609, "span_text": ", following disappointment with the network's results", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 535, "span_end": 641, "span_text": "On September 28, 2009, following disappointment with the network's results, MyNetworkTV dropped its status", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 670, "span_end": 709, "span_text": "transitioned into a programming service", "input_text": "a programming service", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 738, "span_end": 802, "span_text": "relying mainly on repeats of recent broadcast and cable series.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \u2018Green Dragon\u2019 bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero\u2019s face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion.
