There was a tall, iron bulwark beside him, but close by this was replaced by netted rails, through which he caught the pale shimmer of the sea. The warm land-breeze had freshened and ripples splashed against the vessel's side, while every now and then a languid gurgle rose from about her waterline and the foam her plates threw off was filled with phosphorescent flame. A string band was playing on the poop, and passengers and guests moved through the intricate figures of a Spanish dance on the broad deck below. Their poses were graceful and their dress was picturesque, but Dick watched them listlessly. \n\nHe was not in a mood for dancing, for he had been working hard at the dam and his thoughts were disturbed. Clare had refused him, and although he did not accept her decision as final, he could see no way of taking her out of her father's hands, while he had made no progress towards unraveling the latter's plots. Kenwardine was not on board, but Dick had only seen Clare at some distance off across the table in the saloon. Moreover, he thought she must have taken some trouble to avoid meeting him. \n\nThen he remembered the speeches made by the visitors at dinner, and the steamship officers' replies. The former, colored by French and Spanish politeness and American wit, eulogized the power of the British navy and the courage of her merchant captains. There was war, they said, but British commerce went on without a check; goods shipped beneath the red ensign would be delivered safe in spite of storm and strife; Britannia, with trident poised, guarded the seas. For this the boldly-announced sailing list served as text, but Dick, who made allowances for exuberant Latin sentiment, noted the captain's response with some surprise.

I guess you have done it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than once. So it is not surprising that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing. \n\nWhen he left home to go to the Old Pasture, in the hope that he would be able to find something to eat there, he started off bravely. It was cold, very cold indeed, but his fur coat kept him warm as long as he was moving. The Green Meadows were glistening white with snow. All the world, at least all that part of it with which Reddy was acquainted, was white. It was beautiful, very beautiful, as millions of sparkles flashed in the sun. But Reddy had no thought for beauty; the only thought he had room for was to get something to put in the empty stomachs of himself and Granny Fox. \n\nJack Frost had hardened the snow so that Reddy no longer had to wade through it. He could run on the crust now without breaking through. This made it much easier, so he trotted along swiftly.

The Russian emergency situations ministry said the fire was particularly hard to put out because of the high temperatures, narrow passageways and the risk of the building falling down. \n\nMoscow's emergency ministry said the temperature inside the rubble of the library remains high and that there is still a threat that the building could collapse. \n\nVladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the fire, which destroyed 15% of all the documents in the library, reminded him of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. \n\n\"It's a major loss for science. This is the largest collection of its kind in the world, probably equivalent to the Library of Congress,\" Fortov told the agency. \"It contains material that you can't find anywhere else and all the social science institutions use this library.

The commonplace excitement of the tea-drinking and school-gathering would alone have sufficed to make her restless all night; the effect of the terrible drama which had just been enacted before her eyes was not likely to quit her for days.

Huqi's team decided to sell educational books in front of the Children Activity Centre. They thought parents would like to buy books for their children. But unfortunately , they came across urban management officers . The officers asked them to leave. \"We played hide-and-seek with the officers for the whole morning,\" said Hu. \"Finally we gave up and moved to other place. Wang Yongyi and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying the money was to help the \"Project Hope\" for country kids. It worked. More people came to their stall. A foreigner even gave them 100 yuan.

Mark Dayton, who is running for governor. The president also will headline a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee before heading back to the White House on Saturday evening. \n\nIn addition, the president will attend another congressional campaign panel fundraiser Monday in Rhode Island before taking four days off from campaigning to tend to other business at the White House.

F. Scott Fitzgerald appeared to destroy the American Dream, where in anyone, with enough hard work, could get rich and have whatever they wanted from life. He exposed the truth about such myths in this classic book. Basically, the plot could be described as follows: Poor boy goes East in search of wealth, bored and dissatisfied with inactive Mid West country life. He meets the super-rich there, attends parties and makes friends with one man in particular, a lonely millionaire of uncertain origins, Jay Gatsby. He becomes involved with these rich but immoral people, the worst of whom are his own cousin Daisy Buchanan, and her husband Tom. He observes, with dawning recognition, the corruption in their lives, how lacking in human values or ethical beliefs they seem to be. He watches tragedy unfold, brought about by the handlings of the wealthy, and visited on the poorer characters. He remains the only friend of Gatsby, arranging his funeral and mourning his death, and possibly the death of his own American Dream. He wakes up to the reality of what is important in life, and decides to choose what is of value to him. He returns to his origins, having recognized the worth of his up-bringing and the moral values it instilled. He sees that money is not everything. But let us look at this in a little more depth, because the novel is much more complicated than those simple outlines above suggest. The young man, Nick Caraway, aged 29, lived in a cottage on Long Island. He was an apprentice Wall Street trader, and in 1920s, when the novel is set, this job represented a way to get rich, the core value of the American Dream. Gatsby was a millionaire, who chased a dream too, one of rekindling love with Daisy, Nick's cousin, a bored, rich, totally unfeeling and spoilt woman. Her rich husband, Tom Buchanan, a businessman, was also less than moral, flattering his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a garage owner. It was George Wilson's love for Myrtle that brought about the tragedy contained in the Gatsby plot. Gatsby wanted to recapture his dream of love. So he began an affair with Daisy; she was flattered and bored. This action helped to erode Nick's illusions, and show what wealth can do to people. Gatsby suffered from the realization that Daisy was not the wonderful person he dreamed of, but a shallow and materialistic person. Eventually, Tom Buchanan suspected what was happening between Gatsby and Daisy, and confronted Gatsby. It was soon after this that Daisy ran Myrtle Wilson down, while driving Gatsby's yellow automobile. The tragedy was begun, when Tom Buchanan put the idea into head of George Wilson, that Gatsby had killed Myrtle. In fact, Daisy was secure in the belief that superior status and wealth made her immune, and also, her character was such that she cared little for another human being. Tom Buchanan was the catalyst that sent the emotionally disturbed George to shoot Gatsby for killing Myrtle, then committing suicide. Two dreams turned to dust:George's of love and the chance to pursue the dream of capitalist endeavor and success, Gatsby's of recapturing romantic love and the more innocent past, when, in his mind, Daisy was golden and true. The complete destruction was symbolically expressed when none of Gatsby's rich \"friends\" were touched by his death. It was left to Nick, a relative stranger, to make the funeral arrangements. This highlighted the total shallowness of that wealthy, corrupt society, and showed what a worthless person Daisy herself was. At the end, Nick returned to the beliefs of his Mid Western upbringing. After one last meeting with Tom Buchanan, one last look at Gatsby's mansion, having buried his friend, he left for home. As Gatsby lost his dream and his life, Fitzgerald drew a portrait of the death of the American Dream.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who shot Gatsby?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Had he really done that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who did?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who's car was she in?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What color was it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Why did she do it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was Gatsby poor?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was he rich?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How did his friends feel when he died?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who prepared for the funeral?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was NIck?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where did he live?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 2911, "span_end": 3018, "span_text": "Tom Buchanan was the catalyst that sent the emotionally disturbed George to shoot Gatsby for killing Myrtle", "input_text": "George", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 2911, "span_end": 3018, "span_text": "Tom Buchanan was the catalyst that sent the emotionally disturbed George to shoot Gatsby for killing Myrtle", "input_text": "For killing Myrtle", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 2529, "span_end": 2629, "span_text": "It was soon after this that Daisy ran Myrtle Wilson down, while driving Gatsby's yellow automobile.

But uncertainty is really another word for chance. When Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do.

Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school . Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted. She worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there.

Then she went out on the bluff and looked down in the valley. Miss Lord's big car was just passing the Huddle on its way up the valley. \n\nSarah turned and reentered the house. Her meek and diffident expression of countenance had quite disappeared. Her face now wore a look of stern determination and the blue eyes deepened and grew shrewd. \n\nShe walked straight to the den and without hesitation approached the farther wall and took from its pegs Will Morrison's fine hunting rifle. In the stock was a hollow chamber for cartridges, for the rifle was of the type known as a \"repeater.\" Sliding back the steel plate that hid this cavity, Sarah drew from it a folded paper of a yellow tint and calmly spread it on the table before her.

Rebecca Sharrock, 25, is one of just 80 people worldwide who have been identified as having Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory ( HSAM,). It means she can remember every small event-which most people would forget with in (......) days-as if it had happened just minutes ago. \"I remember my mum putting me in the driver's seat of a car and taking a picture of me when I was 12 days old,\" she said. \"That's my earliest memory. I remember every day since then. I can't tell all the dates exactly because I was too young to understand calendars, but I remember what I did that every day, what the weather was like and so on.\" Rebecca can also re-experience taste. If she's eating something that she doesn't like, she thinks about Black Forest cake, her favorite food, and the memory will be so strong that she can nearly \"taste\" it.

He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. \n\nBorn into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. \n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the \"Lost Generation\" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. \n\nHis first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club. He was also a member of the University Cottage Club, which still displays Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials in its library. A poor student, Fitzgerald left Princeton to enlist in the US Army during World War I; however, the war ended shortly after Fitzgerald's enlistment. \n\nFitzgerald had been an alcoholic since his college days, leaving him in poor health by the late 1930s. Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in 1919, and died of a heart attack in 1940.", "questions": [{"input_text": "when was Francis born?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was his occupation?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what term did he create to describe his work?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who was he named after?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "who was Francis Scott Key?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "was he famous?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "where did he attend school?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "when did they move back to minnesota?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "where did he go to school there?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many novels did he finish?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "was one published after hid death?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "which was best known?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "when did he develop a drinking problem?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "when did he have Tuberculosis?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "when did he die?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what did he die from?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "where di he attend college?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "when did he start there?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "why did he leave Princeton?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Was he a good student?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 41, "span_end": 59, "span_text": "September 24, 1896", "input_text": "September 24, 1896", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 80, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "writer", "input_text": "writer", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 160, "span_end": 168, "span_text": "Jazz Age", "input_text": "Jazz Age", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 199, "span_end": 436, "span_text": "Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key.

It's definitely not easy -- because I'm struggling, and I can't imagine what she must be feeling.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is this about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where were they?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What were they doing?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How old is Serena?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is she the older of the two?", "turn_id": 5}], "answers": [{"span_start": 869, "span_end": 890, "span_text": "Both Williams sisters", "input_text": "Both Williams sisters", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 428, "span_end": 482, "span_text": "reach the final of the Family Circle Cup in Charleston", "input_text": "Charleston", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 413, "span_text": "comfortably beating her older sibling ", "input_text": "Playing tennis", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 486, "span_end": 502, "span_text": "The 31-year-old ", "input_text": "31-year-old", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 348, "span_end": 412, "span_text": "Serena Williams said after comfortably beating her older sibling", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}], "name": "cnn_1d256ed6bf0bfeca41dc98393c7ad0b9deca8bce.story"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3ls2amnw5fq6wwzkh3q9uxsiw50qoc", "filename": "Parliament_of_England.txt", "story": "The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England, existing from the early 13th century until 1707, when it became the Parliament of Great Britain after the political union of England and Scotland created the Kingdom of Great Britain. \n\nIn 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. \n\nOver the centuries, the English Parliament progressively limited the power of the English monarchy which arguably culminated in the English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649. After the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and the subsequent Glorious Revolution of 1688, the supremacy of Parliament was a settled principle and all future English and later British sovereigns were restricted to the role of constitutional monarchs with limited executive authority.

Yet Shen Huigang is now getting recognition for his bravery in fighting off a cougar on Vancouver Island, Canada, during a family outing. Shen, also known as Ian, was then an exchange student. With him was a friend, Myles Hagar, and Hagar's two grandchildren. Silently and suddenly a cougar appeared out of nowhere. By the time they spotted the cat, it already had the head of 18-month-old Julien in its mouth. \n\n\"At first, my brain was nothing but blank,\" Shen recalled. \"But I believed I could get the child back.\" He gestured as if he were ready for a fight, and tried to scare the beast off with his bag. Hearing the noise Shen made, the animal dropped the baby and Hagar rushed to grab his grandson. But the animal didn't run, instead turned toward 3-year-old Iris standing beside Shen. \"Had Ian not been there, shouting at the cougar, remaining calm and standing firm, it would certainly have attacked Iris.\" Hagar recalled. \n\nThey chased the animal back into the woods. \"We moved slowly to our vehicle as we waved our fists and bags, pretending to wrestle it,\" Shen said. \"The vehicle wasn't far away but it felt like it took us a century to travel the short journey.\" As Hagar drove for help, Shen held the heavily-bleeding boy in the passenger seat and calmly kept him awake by hugging and kissing him in case he would go into a coma . The boy was flown to a hospital nearby. Doctors later said his little skull had been punctured through to his brain in two places. Luckily, Julien made a full recovery. \n\n\"Any hesitation, even a second delay, would have resulted in certain death for Julien, but Ian was there...\" Hagar said.

This Madame de Quinet had allowed the household to infer, thinking that the whole bearing of her guest was too unlike that of a Paris _bourgeoise_ not to excite suspicion, but she deemed it wiser to refrain from treating her with either intimacy or distinction that might excite jealousy or suspicion. Even as it was, the consciousness of a secret, or the remnants of Montauban gossip, prevented any familiarity between Eustacie and the good ladies who surrounded her; they were very civil to each other, but their only connecting link was the delight that every one took in petting pretty little Rayonette, and the wonder that was made of her signs of intelligence and attempts at talking. Even when she toddled fearlessly up to the stately Duchess on her canopied throne, and held out her entreating hands, and lisped the word '_nontre_,' Madame would pause in her avocations, take her on her knee, and display that wonderful gold and enamel creature which cried tic-tic, and still remained an unapproachable mystery to M. le Marquis and M. le Vicomte, her grandsons.

Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \"computer vision syndrome .\" Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\" he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\" he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\" Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two.

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (1967\u20131982), Ian McLagan (1978\u20131981), Billy Preston (through the mid-1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982\u2013present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles. \n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964, and identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the group began a short period of musical experimentation in the mid-1960s that peaked with the psychedelic album \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" (1967). Subsequently, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with \"Beggars Banquet\" (1968) which along with its follow-ups \"Let It Bleed\" (1969), \"Sticky Fingers\" (1971) and \"Exile on Main St.\" (1972) is generally considered to be the band's best work and is seen as their \"Golden Age\". During this period, they were first introduced on stage as \"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the \"remarkable endurance\" of the Rolling Stones to being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where are the Rolling Stones from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When did they start?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who played piano?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did he leave the band?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did he continue to tour with them?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When did he stop?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was the role of Brian Jones?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When did he quit?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is he still alive", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How long after he quit did he die?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who took his spot?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When did he leave?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who took his spot?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who was lead singer?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who was the drummer?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Were they part of the British Invasion?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where did they invade?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Which culture liked them?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What year did this happen?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 26, "span_end": 60, "span_text": "English rock band formed in London", "input_text": "London", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 64, "span_end": 68, "span_text": "1962", "input_text": "1962", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 255, "span_end": 266, "span_text": "Ian Stewart", "input_text": "Ian Stewart", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 325, "span_end": 329, "span_text": "1963", "input_text": "1963", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 330, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "but continued as a touring member", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 383, "span_end": 387, "span_text": "1985", "input_text": "1985", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 364, "span_end": 379, "span_text": "until his death", "input_text": "He died.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 121, "span_end": 138, "span_text": "guitar, harmonica", "input_text": "guitar and harmonica", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 449, "span_end": 453, "span_text": "1969", "input_text": "1969", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 440, "span_end": 453, "span_text": "death in 1969", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 409, "span_end": 426, "span_text": "less than a month", "input_text": "less than a month", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 487, "span_end": 498, "span_text": "Mick Taylor", "input_text": "Mick Taylor", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 519, "span_end": 523, "span_text": "1974", "input_text": "1974", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 553, "span_end": 564, "span_text": "Ronnie Wood", "input_text": "Ronnie Wood", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 141, "span_end": 152, "span_text": "Mick Jagger", "input_text": "Mick Jagger", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 228, "span_end": 241, "span_text": "Charlie Watts", "input_text": "Charlie Watts", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1100, "span_end": 1133, "span_text": "forefront of the British Invasion", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1166, "span_end": 1172, "span_text": "the US", "input_text": "the US", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1206, "span_end": 1244, "span_text": "youthful and rebellious counterculture", "input_text": "youthful and rebellious counterculture", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1176, "span_end": 1180, "span_text": "1964", "input_text": "1964", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "The_Rolling_Stones.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "36wlnqg78zaxgzk647qnuw355vvbe2", "filename": "mc500.test.70", "story": "Tiger was a pig.

What a chorus of pitiful prayer rises up to the Father, at sea and on shore, on that parting night at home by the vacant bedside, where the wife kneels in tears; round the fire, where the mother and children together pour out their supplications: or on deck, where the seafarer looks up to the stars of heaven, as the ship cleaves through the roaring midnight waters!

Its name originated from the Latin word \"imperium\", which means to rule over large territories. Imperialism is \"a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means\". Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world. It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.

but the reply always was that they went out very little, and that this once it would not hurt her. \n\nThe truth was that Theodora had expressed a decided aversion to going out with the Brandons.

Her habits in company had not been materially changed by her engagement; she was still bent on being the first object, and Violet sometimes felt that her manner was hardly fair upon those who were ignorant of her circumstances.

A primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul C\u00e9zanne. A retrospective of C\u00e9zanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. \n\nIn France, offshoots of Cubism developed, including Orphism, Abstract art and later Purism. In other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism and De Stijl developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the art movement the article is discussing?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who started it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which artist was a major influence on them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "His early paintings?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What led to them seeing his art?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where at?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did this occur?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Were those mostly his later works?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When were those first seen?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What style did Cezanne incorporate that was so influential?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did other artists besides Picasso and Braque jump on board?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How was constructivism influenced by Picasso?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did cubism lead to other art forms?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Which developed in France?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did different types of art start up in other countries as well?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What were these called?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Were all of these related to cubism?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What is one thing that futurist paintings get from cubism?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What does the term \"multiple perspective\" mean?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Would the association of mechanization and modern life be related to these art forms?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 205, "span_end": 211, "span_text": "Cubism", "input_text": "Cubism", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 30, "span_end": 62, "span_text": "Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso", "input_text": "Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 282, "span_end": 294, "span_text": "Paul C\u00e9zanne", "input_text": "Paul C\u00e9zanne", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 267, "span_end": 278, "span_text": " late works", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 296, "span_end": 348, "span_text": "A retrospective of C\u00e9zanne's paintings had been held", "input_text": "A retrospective of C\u00e9zanne's paintings had been held", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 351, "span_end": 371, "span_text": " the Salon d'Automne", "input_text": "the Salon d'Automne", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 379, "span_text": "1904", "input_text": "1904", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 296, "span_end": 311, "span_text": "A retrospective", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 417, "span_end": 430, "span_text": "1905 and 1906", "input_text": "1905 and 1906", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 237, "span_end": 260, "span_text": " three-dimensional form", "input_text": "three-dimensional form", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 74, "span_end": 171, "span_text": "Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand L\u00e9ger and Juan Gris", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1019, "span_end": 1064, "span_text": "constructing sculpture from separate elements", "input_text": "constructing sculpture from separate elements", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 560, "span_text": "offshoots of Cubism developed", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 572, "span_end": 610, "span_text": "Orphism, Abstract art and later Purism", "input_text": "Orphism, Abstract art and later Purism", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 612, "span_end": 630, "span_text": "In other countries", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 631, "span_end": 687, "span_text": "Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism and De Stijl", "input_text": "Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism and De Stijl", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 698, "span_end": 719, "span_text": "in response to Cubism", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 773, "span_end": 811, "span_text": "the fusing of the past and the present", "input_text": "the fusing of the past and the present", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 835, "span_end": 891, "span_text": "different views of the subject pictured at the same time", "input_text": "different views of the subject pictured at the same time", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1181, "span_end": 1233, "span_text": "nd the association of mechanization and modern life.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "CubismCubism_827b46b6ebad94126495e1cf6f55370a1ce30a86aa5bf2e1c24ae726"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3ii4upycoj7fsz8vructj3gjrjmdqe", "filename": "mc500.test.111", "story": "One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly.

Two bystanders pulled Hirsch off of Bernfeld before police arrived. Some \"redness\" was seen around Bernfeld's neck, according to authorities. \n\nThe incident happened after Hirsch allegedly confronted Bernfeld, calling her a \"rich kid\" and questioning why she looked \"so tough.\" Hirsch reportedly admitted to being in a verbal confrontation with Bernfeld and that he had consumed three to four drinks that evening. He also claimed that he did not know Bernfeld personally. \n\nThat's not quite the same story he's sharing now. According to Hirsch's lawyer Robert Offer, he consumed an \"enormous amount of alcohol that night\" and has since checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, where he currently remains.

He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King. David conquers Jerusalem, taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David arranges the death of Uriah the Hittite to cover his adultery with Bathsheba. The text does not state whether she consented to sex.

The main character in My Left Foot,based on the real story of cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown,can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \"one of the truly great pianists,\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental hospital didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received seven Oscar nominations , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott. Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one. Employed at a high school where kids are expected to fail, Escalante challenges his math students to struggle for better things, like getting good grades in the AP exam. Despite the obstacles in their lives, the classmates achieve their goals, thanks to Mr. Escalante's support. The real Jaime Escalante, the Best Teacher in America, says that Stand and Deliver is \"90% truth, 10% drama.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is My Left Foot based on?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What illness did he have?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Could he talk?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How did he communicate?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which pianist had a break down?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did he recover quickly?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How long was he hospitalized for?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was Jaime Escalante's occupation?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was he bad at his job?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was the movie called that was about him?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How much of it was true?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did Benigni receive any awards?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Which one?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was his role?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "And in what year did it take place?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did he have any children?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "And his age?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 178, "span_end": 191, "span_text": "Christy Brown", "input_text": "Christy Brown", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 154, "span_end": 168, "span_text": "cerebral palsy", "input_text": "cerebral palsy", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 192, "span_end": 226, "span_text": "can barely move his mouth to speak", "input_text": "barely", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 232, "span_end": 260, "span_text": "by controlling his left foot", "input_text": "by controlling his left foot", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 481, "span_end": 495, "span_text": "David Helfgott", "input_text": "David Helfgott", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 657, "span_end": 687, "span_text": "Ten years in a mental hospital", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 657, "span_end": 666, "span_text": "Ten years", "input_text": "Ten years", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1641, "span_end": 1655, "span_text": " math students", "input_text": "Teacher", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1867, "span_end": 1890, "span_text": "Best Teacher in America", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1392, "span_end": 1409, "span_text": "Stand and Deliver", "input_text": "Stand and Deliver", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1924, "span_end": 1933, "span_text": "90% truth", "input_text": "90%", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1374, "span_end": 1390, "span_text": "best actor Oscar", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1374, "span_end": 1390, "span_text": "best actor Oscar", "input_text": "best actor Oscar", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1023, "span_end": 1032, "span_text": " a father", "input_text": "a father trapped in a Nazi camp", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1146, "span_end": 1151, "span_text": " 1945", "input_text": "1945", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1090, "span_end": 1105, "span_text": " 4-year-old son", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1091, "span_end": 1105, "span_text": "4-year-old son", "input_text": "One", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1090, "span_end": 1101, "span_text": " 4-year-old", "input_text": "4-year-old", "turn_id": 18}], "name": "high10577.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3os46crslfz8cypx36ypjk5zsuc6vi", "filename": "Perl.txt", "story": "Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.

Had not this little party been promised to Eleanor, in his present state of mind he would probably have avoided such gaiety; but the promise had been given, the invitations were to be written, and when Eleanor consulted her father on the subject, she was not ill pleased to hear him say, \"Oh, I was thinking of Bold, so I took it into my head to write to him myself, but you must write to his sister.\" \n\nMary Bold was older than her brother, and, at the time of our story, was just over thirty. She was not an unattractive young woman, though by no means beautiful. Her great merit was the kindliness of her disposition. She was not very clever, nor very animated, nor had she apparently the energy of her brother; but she was guided by a high principle of right and wrong; her temper was sweet, and her faults were fewer in number than her virtues. Those who casually met Mary Bold thought little of her; but those who knew her well loved her well, and the longer they knew her the more they loved her. Among those who were fondest of her was Eleanor Harding; and though Eleanor had never openly talked to her of her brother, each understood the other's feelings about him.

He had cabled to England for a big centrifugal pump and a second-hand locomotive-type boiler, while, when they arrived, Macallister said that five hundred pounds would not tempt him to raise full steam on the latter. He also purchased a broken-down launch, and, though she was cheap, the cost of her and the pump, with other necessaries, made a considerable hole in his remaining \u00c2\u00a32,000. It was for this reason he undertook to make the needful repairs himself, with the help of a steamer's donkey-man who had somehow got left behind, while Austin and Macallister spent most of the week during which the _Estremedura_ lay at Las Palmas in the workshop he had extemporised. He appeared to know a little about machinery, and could, at least, handle hack-saw and file in a fashion which moved Macallister to approbation, while Austin noticed that the latter's sardonic smile became less frequent as he and the American worked together. \n\nJefferson was grimly in earnest, and it was evident that his thoroughness, which overlooked nothing, compelled the engineer's admiration. It also occurred to Austin that, while there are many ways in which a lover may prove his devotion, few other men would probably have cared for the one Jefferson had undertaken. He was not a very knightly figure when he emerged, smeared with rust and scale, from the second-hand boiler, or crawled about the launch's engines with blackened face and hands; but Austin, who remembered it was for Muriel Gascoyne he had staked all his little capital in that desperate venture, forebore to smile.

Call centers are offices where most telephone calls for a business can be answered. For example, a woman in the United States who calls her computer company about a problem might speak with someone in India or Pakistan. \n\nCall centers serve businesses in local and international markets. And they have added to economic growth by providing well-paid jobs and new skills for workers who might not have had such employment. Ahsan Saeed is a young call center worker in Karachi, Pakistan.

He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal. \n\nMany historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\". According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote\".

Valdez got help from community workers. On his first birthday party, at the age of 7, Valdez decided what he wanted most was to help other children who were still living on the streets. \"I didn't have a lot of money, but I had a lot of love to give,\" Valdez explained. That day was the birth of the organization, Championing Community Children. Since then, Valdez and his friends visit homeless children and hand out bags with slippers, toys and even candy.

The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. \n\nHampshire is the largest county in South East England and remains the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county in all contemporary boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1890, Hampshire was the fifth-largest county in England. It now has an overall area of , and measures about east\u2013west and north\u2013south. \n\nHampshire's tourist attractions include many seaside resorts and two national parks: the New Forest and the South Downs (together covering some 45% of the county).

Then followed the noise of shutting books and closing desks, and the bustle and shuffling of anticipated dismissal. \n\nIn a front seat sat a girl who did not arise with the others, and as one by one several girls passed her desk with hurried step and embarrassed snicker she looked at them with purple, blazing eyes. \n\nMiss Hill attended to her usual task with the papers of the day's lessons and the marking of the morrow's work before she glanced up at the five girls she had detained. They sat in widely separated sections of the room. Rose Clymer, pretty, fragile, curly-haired, occupied the front seat of the end row. Her face had no color and her small mouth was set in painful lines. Four seats across from her Bessy Bell leaned on her desk, with defiant calmness, and traces of scorn still in her expressive eyes.

But as Gingrich rose to challenge him in polls, he was forced to address the other candidates in the race. \n\nHis victory speech was a one-on-one with Obama. \n\n\"This president began his presidency by apologizing for America.

Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th-century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants. The Congress led India to independence from Great Britain, and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire. \n\nThe Congress is a secular party whose social liberal platform is generally considered on the centre-left of Indian politics. The Congress' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya\u2014the lifting up of all sections of society\u2014which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. The party primarily endorses social liberalism \u2014 seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice, and secularism \u2014 asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings. \n\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the Congress formed the government at center in most instances, and many regional state governments. Congress became India's dominant political party; , in the 15 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times, heading the central government for 49 years. There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947\u201364), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004\u201314). Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014, it remains one of two major, nationwide, political parties in India, along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). In the 2014 general election, the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance, winning only 44 seats of the 543-member Lok Sabha.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is INC?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was INC ever independent?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who did they break free from?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was the leader?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what happened in 1947?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many prime ministers were there?", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Who was the first one?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "and the most recent one?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "why did congress perform slowly in elections?", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "How many political parties are there in India?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what are they?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 3, "span_end": 36, "span_text": " Indian National Congress () (INC", "input_text": "Indian National Congress", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 450, "span_end": 507, "span_text": "The Congress led India to independence from Great Britain", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 466, "span_end": 507, "span_text": " India to independence from Great Britain", "input_text": "Great Britain", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 297, "span_end": 385, "span_text": "Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement", "input_text": "Mahatma Gandhi", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1155, "span_end": 1183, "span_text": "India's independence in 1947", "input_text": "India gained independence", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1551, "span_end": 1581, "span_text": "seven Congress Prime Ministers", "input_text": "seven", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1587, "span_end": 1615, "span_text": "first being Jawaharlal Nehru", "input_text": "Jawaharlal Nehru", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1631, "span_end": 1661, "span_text": "the most recent Manmohan Singh", "input_text": "Manmohan Singh", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1768, "span_end": 1818, "span_text": " two major, nationwide, political parties in India", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1819, "span_end": 1887, "span_text": " along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bhartiya Janata Party", "input_text": "Bhartiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Indian_National_Congress.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3a1pq49wvhh8nbtgsb549nn9cve1h0", "filename": "RhineRhine_0b4cb23e3341b45f3c7295835304aaeac156c8fd4d496fa78ce04d9b", "story": "The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

Usually set up in converted storefronts, these small, simple theaters charged five cents for admission and flourished from about 1905 to 1915. \n\n\"Nickelodeon\" was concocted from \"nickel\", the name of the U.S. five-cent coin, and the ancient Greek word \"odeion\", a roofed-over theater, the latter indirectly by way of the \"Od\u00e9on\" in Paris, emblematic of a very large and luxurious theater much as \"Ritz\" was of a grand hotel. For unknown reasons, in 1949 the lyricist of a popular song, \"Music! Music! Music!\", incorporated the refrain \"Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon\u2026\", evidently referring to either a jukebox or a mechanical musical instrument such as a coin-operated player piano or orchestrion. The meaning of the word has been muddied ever since. In fact, when it was current in the early 20th century, it was used only to refer to a small five-cent theater and not to any coin-in-the-slot machine, including amusement arcade motion picture viewers such as the Kinetoscope and Mutoscope. \n\nThe earliest films had been shown in \"peep show\" machines or projected in vaudeville theaters as one of the otherwise live acts. Nickelodeons drastically altered film exhibition practices and the leisure-time habits of a large segment of the American public. Although they were characterized by continuous performances of a selection of short films, added attractions such as illustrated songs were sometimes an important feature. Regarded as disreputable and dangerous by some civic groups and municipal agencies, crude, ill-ventilated nickelodeons with hard wooden seats were outmoded as longer films became common and larger, more comfortably furnished motion picture theaters were built, a trend that culminated in the lavish \"movie palaces\" of the 1920s.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is this about a popular kids' station on modern TV?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Does it share the same name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What's that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What contraptions were the first movies played in?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How else were movies presented?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did this largely create no change in how people spent their time?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Were other types of entertainment added?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Such as?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was anyone against these places?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why didn't they like them?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Were they refined and comfortable?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What happened in the twenties?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How long did the simpler shows last?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Where did their name come from?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What about the last half of the name?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Which means?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What was a well-known musical track in the forties?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Is a place where you can pay to stay overnight in a room mentioned?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What was it called?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 109, "span_text": "The nickelodeon was the first type of indoor exhibition space dedicated to showing projected motion pictures.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 62, "span_text": "The nickelodeon was the first type of indoor exhibition space ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 256, "span_end": 267, "span_text": "Nickelodeon", "input_text": "Nickelodeon", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1152, "span_end": 1172, "span_text": "\"peep show\" machines", "input_text": "\"peep show\" machines", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1176, "span_end": 1208, "span_text": "projected in vaudeville theaters", "input_text": "projected in vaudeville theaters", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1244, "span_end": 1372, "span_text": "Nickelodeons drastically altered film exhibition practices and the leisure-time habits of a large segment of the American public", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1024, "span_end": 1113, "span_text": "including amusement arcade motion picture viewers such as the Kinetoscope and Mutoscope.

The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, included it being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service, PlayStation Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote control the console from the devices.

This ground for difference had vanished, but he wondered what she thought, and could not gather much from her letter. \n\nShe wrote with apparent good-humor and stated that all was going satisfactorily at the farm, where, indeed, nothing of importance could be done until spring.

Unfortunately, the explanation must be put off, because there was one point on which he was still determined, although his resolve no longer altogether sprang from pride. He must, if possible, repair his damaged fortunes before he went home. Farming on a proper scale was expensive work, and Helen's capital was not large.

He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room.

Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. \n\nThe next morning, Sue awoke after an hour's sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. \"Pull up the shade; I want to see,\" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed. \n\nAfter the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. It was still dark green at the center. But its edges were color1ed with the yellow. It hung bravely from the branch about seven meters above the ground. \n\n\"It is the last one,\" said Johnsy. \"I thought it would surely fail during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.\" \n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Sue, leaning her worn face down toward the bed. \"Think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?\" But Johnsy did not answer. \n\nThe next morning, when it was light, Johnsy demanded that the window shade be raised. The ivy leaf was still there. Johnsy lay for a long time, looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was preparing chicken soup. \n\n\"I've been a bad girl,\" said Johnsy. \"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how bad I was. It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.\" \n\nAn hour later she said: \"someday I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.\" \n\nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hallway. \"Even chances. With good care, you'll win,\" said the doctor. \"And now I must see another case I have in your building. Behrman, whose name is some kind of an artist, I believe, has Pneumonia , too. He is an old, weak man and his case is severe. There is no hope for him, but he goes to the hospital today to ease his pain.\" \n\nThe next day, the doctor said to Sue:\" She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.\" \n\nLater that day, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, and put one arm around her. \"I have something to tell you, white mouse,\" she said, \"Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick only two days. They found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night. \n\n\"And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been moved from its place. And art supplies and a painting board with green and yellow color1s mixed on it. \n\n\"Look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall.

It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. ECMAScript has remained the best-known implementation of JavaScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. Coders commonly use ECMAScript for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js. \n\nThe ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; initially it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release. In March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript. \n\nOwing to the widespread success of JavaScript as a client-side scripting language for Web pages, Microsoft developed a compatible dialect of the language, naming it JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript added new date methods to alleviate the Year 2000 problem caused by the JavaScript methods that were based on the Java \"Date\" class. JScript was included in Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996. \n\nNetscape delivered JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization and the work on the specification, ECMA-262, began in November 1996. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then. The name \"ECMAScript\" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions. Eich commented that \"ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is ECMAScript?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who created it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "From which company?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was it originally called?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When did it become known as Javascript?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What browser supported it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What issue did Javascript have?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who tried to fix the problem?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was the name of their effort?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why did they call it that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why was ECMAScript created?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 68, "span_text": "ECMAScript (or ES) is a trademarked scripting-language specification", "input_text": "a trademarked scripting-language specification", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 666, "span_end": 699, "span_text": "anguage developed by Brendan Eich", "input_text": "Brendan Eich", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 687, "span_end": 711, "span_text": "Brendan Eich of Netscape", "input_text": "Netscape", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 712, "span_end": 742, "span_text": " initially it was named Mocha,", "input_text": "Mocha,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 785, "span_end": 853, "span_text": "In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript", "input_text": "In December 1995", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1303, "span_end": 1344, "span_text": "JScript was included in Internet Explorer", "input_text": "Internet Explorer", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 877, "span_end": 911, "span_text": "March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0", "input_text": "Netscape Navigator 2.0", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1135, "span_end": 1160, "span_text": "to avoid trademark issues", "input_text": "trademark", "turn_id": 8, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1059, "span_end": 1100, "span_text": "Microsoft developed a compatible dialect ", "input_text": "Microsoft", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1117, "span_end": 1134, "span_text": "naming it JScript", "input_text": "JScript", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1117, "span_end": 1160, "span_text": "naming it JScript to avoid trademark issues", "input_text": "t to avoid trademark issues", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 142, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "created to standardize JavaScript", "input_text": "to standardize JavaScript", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "ECMAScript.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3lya37p8iqn02zcg0t1qsrgaqxokb3", "filename": "cnn_d4eaaca39745f07f022fbf8024da699a0eac18fd.story", "story": "(CNN) -- The death of a University of Oklahoma football player was caused by multiple drugs in his system -- including five different painkillers -- at the time of death nearly two months ago, according to the state's toxicology report released Tuesday. \n\n\"It is with much sadness we look back and see that recently Austin had turned to other methods of managing his pain,\" said the parents of Austin Box, 22.

At the store the other people looked at Max and Greg. They had never seen an alligator and a wolf who are friends before. Max and Greg laughed at this. Max got the chocolate and bananas to make his cake and Greg got the strawberries and blueberries to make his pie. They left the store.

But there are three Nobel prize-winning scientists who actually chose to experiment on themselves - all in the name of science, reported The Telegraph. 1. Werner Forssmann (Nobel prize winner in 1956) Forssmann was a German scientist. He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery. Experiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous. Not giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart. 2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005) Most doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. So he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria. Five days later, he lost his appetite and soon was vomiting each morning - he indeed had gastritis. 3. Ralph Steinman (Nobel prize winner in 2011) This Canadian scientist discovered a new type of immune system cell called the dendritic cell. He believed that it had the ability to fight against cancer. Steinman knew he couldn't yet use his method to treat patients. So in 2007, when doctors told him that he had cancer and that it was unlikely for him to live longer than a year, he saw an opportunity. With the help of his colleagues, he gave himself three different vaccines based on his research and a total of eight experimental therapies. Even though Steinman eventually died from his cancer, he lived four and a half years, much longer than doctors had said he would.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Do chemists usually use rats for their testing?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who uses rats?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was Werner Forssmann?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "when did he when the Nobel prize?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what did he study?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which human did he want to perform an experiment on?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "was he supposed to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "did he do it anyway?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what did he do to his arm?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "then where did he go?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "to do what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who was Ralph Steinman?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "did he discover something?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what was it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what disease did he think it could fight?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "did he ever when the Nobel Prize?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "when?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "how did he die?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "did he live longer than expected?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "how much longer?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 128, "span_end": 151, "span_text": "living things like rats", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 81, "span_end": 115, "span_text": "biologists and medical researchers", "input_text": "biologists and medical researchers", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 370, "span_end": 386, "span_text": "German scientist", "input_text": "German scientist", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 326, "span_end": 352, "span_text": "Nobel prize winner in 1956", "input_text": "1956", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 388, "span_end": 509, "span_text": "He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery.

He was certainly not an usher, as he was paid three hundred a year for his work--which is quite beyond the mark of ushers. So much was certain; but yet the word stuck in his throat and made him uncomfortable. He did not like to reflect that he was home for the holidays. \n\nBut he had determined that he would never come home for the holidays again. At Christmas he would leave the school at which he had won his appointment with so much trouble, and go into an open profession. Indeed he had chosen his profession, and his mode of entering it. He would become a civil engineer, and perhaps a land surveyor, and with this view he would enter himself as a pupil in the great house of Beilby & Burton. The terms even had been settled. He was to pay a premium of five hundred pounds and join Mr. Burton, who was settled in the town of Stratton, for twelve months before he placed himself in Mr. Beilby's office in London. Stratton was less than twenty miles from Clavering. It was a comfort to him to think that he could pay this five hundred pounds out of his own earnings, without troubling his father.

It is one of the youngest of the major world religions. The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, unity of all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for social justice for the benefit and prosperity of all, and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. In the early 21st century there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them living in the Indian state of Punjab. \n\nSikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru, and the nine Sikh gurus that succeeded him. The Tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the eternal, impersonal spiritual guide for Sikhs. Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth. \n\nSikhism emphasises simran (meditation on the words of the Guru Granth Sahib), that can be expressed musically through kirtan or internally through Nam Japo (repeat God's name) as a means to feel God's presence. It teaches followers to avoid the \"Five Thieves\" (lust, rage, greed, attachment and conceit). Hand in hand, secular life is considered to be intertwined with the spiritual life. Guru Nanak taught that living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" is above the metaphysical truth, and that the ideal man is one who \"establishes union with God, knows His Will, and carries out that Will\".

Indeed, it sounds like a pain. But some luxuries of a phone-free lifestyle make us realize that freedom has long been absent from our lives with a phone. According to The Wall Street Journal's Anton Troianovski. people expect less of you when you don't have a cell phone. Melissa Hildebrand, for example, doesn't even own n phone. She just leaves if her friends don't turn up on time for an event or meeting. \"She gives them 15 to 30 minutes to show up,\" writes Troianovski. With a cell phone in hand, one receives apology calls, which will lengthen the waiting. Without a phone, that responsibility seems to reduce. Dean Obeidallah of CNN believes that not having a cell phone gives him the ability to see things; A beautiful woman burning past while fixing her makeup; Asian tourists busy taking photos; a businessman talking on his phone and looking important. \"Instead of texting or checking my e-mail, I began to actually, look at the people I sharing the streets with. It is truly like a movie set filled with extras from all walks of life, Obeidallah said. Along with these small benefits of not having a phone, however, come all its inconvenience. Nancy Kadlick told The Wall Street Journal that she once missed an airport pick-up due to not having a phone. For Rebecca Greenfield, a columnist for the Atlantic Wire, the inconvenience of not having a phone outweigh(;) these small luxuries.

five-year-old British boy who was kidnapped in Pakistan earlier this month has been found safe and is back with his relatives, the British High Commission said Tuesday. \n\nSahil Saeed was released at a school in the Punjab province of Pakistan, said Assistant Chief Constable David Thompson of the Greater Manchester Police in England, near his parents' residence in Oldham. \n\nFrom there, Sahil wandered into a field and was found by residents who looked after him until police arrived, Thompson said. \n\nRegional Pakistani police said Sahil was found near the town of Danga in Punjab province, close to where he was abducted March 3. \n\nSahil was in good condition, said Aslam Tareen, the head of the regional police. \n\n\"He is with members of family in Pakistan and the Pakistani police, and there is also contact from the British High Commission,\" Thompson said. He added that Sahil had already spoken to his mother and father in England by telephone and that both parents were \"clearly relieved\" to speak to their son. \n\nThe High Commission issued a statement thanking police in Jhelum, another town in the eastern province of Punjab, for the boy's return. \n\n\"This is fantastic news that brings to an end a traumatic ordeal faced by Sahil and his family,\" said Adam Thomson, the British high commissioner to Pakistan. \n\nPolice arrested some of the kidnappers, said Rana Sanaullah, the provincial law minister. \n\nSahil, a British citizen of Pakistani descent, was on the last day of a two-week vacation in Pakistan before he was to return home to Oldham, in northern England.

Indeed, the girl was very happy this especial evening, although tired with her duties at the Kermess. A climax in her young life had arrived, and she greeted it joyously, believing she loved Arthur well enough to become his wife. \n\nNow that the engagement had been announced to their immediate circle of friends she felt as proud and elated as any young girl has a right to be under the circumstances. \n\nAdded to this pleasant event was the social triumph she and her cousins had enjoyed at the Kermess, where Louise especially had met with rare favor. The fashionable world had united in being most kind and considerate to the dainty, attractive young _debutante_, and only Diana had seemed to slight her. This was not surprising in view of the fact that Diana evidently wanted Arthur for herself, and there was some satisfaction in winning a lover who was elsewhere in prime demand. In addition to all this the little dance that concluded the evening's entertainment had been quite delightful, and all things conspired to put Louise in a very contented frame of mind. Still fluttering with the innocent excitements of the hour the girl went to join Arthur without a fear of impending misfortune. She did not think of Charlie Mershone at all. He had been annoying and impertinent, and she had rebuked him and sent him away, cutting him out of her life altogether. Perhaps she ought to have remembered that she had mildly flirted with Diana's cousin and given him opportunity for the impassioned speeches she resented; but Louise had a girlish idea that there was no harm in flirting, considering it a feminine license. She saw young Mershone at the Kermess that evening paying indifferent attentions to other women and ignoring her, and was sincerely glad to have done with him for good and all.

The tale is mainly about the French Revolution in 1789, where the poor rose up against the king and the nobles. Dickens showed deep sympathy for the poor and deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class, though he wrote quite a lot about the love triangle between Lucie, Charles and Sydney. \n\nIn this novel, Dickens wrote some lively characters like Sydney and those crazy revolutionaries. In this tale, we can't see any absolute roles. Charles, though he's a brave and good man, obviously he hasn't as much ability as Sydney. Sydney, a typical tragic man, a man like him, usually has great ability. But he has some weak points on characters and the worst is that he always loves a woman he shouldn't love and 99.99% die for her at last in an extremely heroic or tragic way. The revolutionaries are not as full of justice as usual. They get mad when they can get revenge for their unfair treatment. The fire of hatred burns everything. When they're at the bottom of the society, they're calling for justice, for fair treatment, for freedom, but when they're in charge of the society, their world is up-side-down. They hate everything that is connected to the very people against them, even including Charles' wife, Dr. Manette's daughter. So _ have no difference from those former governors at heart. \n\nThough Dickens told us how the authority is recycling over and over again in some way, the novel is about something good. Love from Sydney to Lucie is one of the only few bright points in the novel and it's really great. A man can sacrifice his life to save his lover's husband. He doesn't have any personal purpose and just for his lover's happiness. So Dickens may imply us, only love can solve the problems between people, between the poor and the rich, love is everything.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who are some of the main characters in the book?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "in what book?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "I dickens from Australia?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what does he think of the poor?", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "during what historic time period?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "are the revolutionaries full of justice?", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "what happens when they are in charge?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "is Charles a brave man?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what is one of the bright points in the novel?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how do the revolutionaries feel about Charle's wife?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what does DIckens think of the upper class?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1516, "span_end": 1531, "span_text": "Sydney to Lucie", "input_text": "Sydney and Lucie", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 20, "span_text": "A Tale of Two Cities", "input_text": "A Tale of Two Cities", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 46, "span_end": 76, "span_text": " English writer Charles Dicken", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 157, "span_text": " where the poor rose up", "input_text": "he writes about the poor rising up", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 104, "span_end": 133, "span_text": "the French Revolution in 1789", "input_text": "the French Revolution in 1789", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 191, "span_end": 283, "span_text": "Dickens showed deep sympathy for the poor and deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1164, "span_end": 1192, "span_text": " their world is up-side-down", "input_text": "their world is up-side-down", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 518, "span_end": 559, "span_text": "Charles, though he's a brave and good man", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1506, "span_end": 1531, "span_text": "Love from Sydney to Lucie", "input_text": "Love from Sydney to Lucie", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1194, "span_end": 1294, "span_text": "They hate everything that is connected to the very people against them, even including Charles' wife", "input_text": "they hate her", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 236, "span_end": 283, "span_text": " deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class", "input_text": "he showed deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high7174.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3vj40nv2qinjocrcy7k4z235g9xotg", "filename": "cnn_99b80b2c8e66526376d9f7d2e5577b1107eeaa36.story", "story": "Seven years ago, Dawn Larkin-Wallace, a mom of three, took up running to lose that 10 to 20 pounds of baby weight that just wouldn't go away. \n\nShe figured once she dropped the weight, she'd be off the treadmill. \n\nWhat she could have never imagined is that she'd become a marathon runner who inspired her three children to start running, too. \n\n\"We're just a running family,\" said Larkin-Wallace of Baldwin, New York, who is part of the running club Black Girls RUN!, a national group encouraging African-American women to make health and fitness a priority. \n\nFirst, Larkin-Wallace signed up 15-year-old daughter Kayla, a high school sophomore, for a race after realizing that the amount of running she did during her soccer games was the equivalent of a 5K. \n\nWith the \"positive peer pressure ... and the competitive spirit\" that exists in the Wallace household, she said with a laugh, \"of course, her brother and sister decided that that's something they wanted to do, too.\" \n\nKimberly, 11, and Kevin Jr., 9, ran their first 5K's this year. \n\nLarkin-Wallace said her goal is for \"healthy living to become a lifestyle and not just a fad\" among her kids, who also play a range of sports from basketball to soccer to lacrosse. \n\nWhat she's also very mindful of is encouraging her children, especially her girls, to feel good about their bodies.

He was, of course, under much stress himself, like everyone else. A good exam result meant a good high school; a mediocre score meant a mediocre school. _ . However, he loved basketball so much that he still found time to play, this time with a group of guys who were said to have skipped classes before. Some of his teachers started worrying about him. They asked his mother to go to school to let her know that Jack was hanging out with problem kids. When his mother returned home that day, she wanted to talk to Jack. Knowing the purpose of her visit to the school, Jack thought his mother would punish him for befriending those bad guys. To his surprise, his mother was not angry with him at all. She wanted to hear her son's side of the story. So Jack told his mother about what he knew of Simon and Peter. Simon's parents were badly ill; Peter's father had lost his job. They both seemed to Jack to be normal kids. Jack's mother thought for a moment, then went on to say that she was OK with her son playing with them and that she and her son should think of ways to help these kids. Soon Jack's mum introduced some part-time jobs to Simon and Peter, which they accepted. She believed in her son and cared about those who were less lucky. Jack's basketball friends and he have left for different places, but they still keep in touch. He knows Peter is now a manager of a local bank. Simon is currently a freshman at a university.

On February 14, 2011, Iranian authorities placed Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard under house arrest for calling on Iranians to demonstrate in support of the popular Arab uprisings across the region. \n\nAccording to Reuters, earlier this month Karroubi was moved from a Ministry of Intelligence-controlled safe house to his own home. \n\nThe transfer shined new light on the plight of Iran's \"prisoners of rights\"\u2014 those imprisoned for seeking to exercise commonly recognized political, social, religious, economic, and cultural rights, denied to them by the Iranian government. \n\nIn addition to opposition politicians like Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard, Iran's prisoners of rights include lawyers, journalists, professors, students, labor union workers, poets, musicians, artists, dissident clerics, bloggers, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBT persons and even humanitarian aid workers. \n\nCivil rights and human rights activists are also a primary target.

It can reveal laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author ofThe Social Animal, The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to resist the temptation. \n\nBrooks gained fame for several books. His latest bookThe Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science revealed about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? \n\nTo answer these questions, Brooks surveys a wide range of subjects. Because of this, you might expect the book to cover a variety of facts. But Brooks has structured his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. \n\nOn the whole, Brooks's story is acceptable if uninspired. As one would expect, his writing is mostly clear and, to be fair, some chapters stand out above the rest. I enjoyed, for instance, the chapter in which Harold discovers how to think on his own. While Harold and Erica are certainly not strong characters, the more serious problems withThe Social Animallie elsewhere. These problems partly involve Brooks's attempt to translate his tale into science.", "questions": [{"input_text": "how many uses are listed for science?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 27, "span_end": 112, "span_text": "It can reveal laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "high14906.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3wev0ko0omsr5fn8jy1ye3vka9udsv", "filename": "cnn_c48e709762f8fc6f19d7d4ce79dd686e65fcbf01.story", "story": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- A jury began deliberating Wednesday afternoon in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against \"Desperate Housewives\" creator Marc Cherry. \n\nThe jury of nine women and three men is to decide whether Cherry killed off a Sheridan's character in retaliation for the actress complaining that he hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy.

THE HOUSE ON THE HILL \n\nThere was a little unfailing spring, always icy cold and crystal pure, in a certain birch-screened hollow of Rainbow Valley in the lower corner near the marsh. Not a great many people knew of its existence. The manse and Ingleside children knew, of course, as they knew everything else about the magic valley. Occasionally they went there to get a drink, and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance. Anne knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved Dryad's Bubble at Green Gables. Rosemary West knew of it; it was her fountain of romance, too. Eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one spring twilight and heard young Martin Crawford stammer out a confession of fervent, boyish love. She had whispered her own secret in return, and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring. They had never stood together by it again--Martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon after; but to Rosemary West it was always a sacred spot, hallowed by that immortal hour of youth and love. Whenever she passed near it she turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream--a dream from which the pain had long gone, leaving only its unforgettable sweetness. \n\nThe spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water. A maple-tree grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint seat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around the hollow.

Nine years later, keeping her weight steady and her health intact is a daily battle. If she knows she will be going to a tasting at a bakery or eating a four-course meal, she usually eats fruits or salads throughout the day. Now she is always keeping track of what's in the food she eats and she says most people don't even look at or consider it. At one tasting task alone, she says, upward of l,000 calories is often added to her day. That's about half of the recommended total calories per day for the average adult. \n\nBut even though she's thought of a special eating method, Fernau says sticking to it is a daily battle. And food editors, writers and critics across the country couldn't agree more. \"When I'm at home or not eating for work, it's healthy food to the extreme,\" says Phil Vettel, who's been a restaurant critic for the Chicago Tribune for 19 years. \n\nVettle, who eats dinner at four restaurants each week, says unlike most professions, he has no right to choose. \"If I'm going out to eat, I can't choose the healthiest thing on the menu, I have to eat when they're bringing me. \" While Vettel exercises when he can, Joe Yonan, a food editor at The Washington Post, has strengthened his exercise habits since he started the job two years ago. Yonan says he realized early on that he was gaining weight and immediately hired a personal trainer to meet with three times a week, on top of his body training three to five times a week. \n\nStill, it's a struggle that many Americans might envy.

backed by local police arrested four people overnight on suspicion of plotting terror attacks, the Swedish Security Service told CNN Sunday. \n\nThe four were held in the city of Gothenburg for \"probable cause\" of preparing the attacks, the highest level of suspicion in Sweden, said Sara Kvarnstrom, a spokeswoman for the security force. \n\nShe refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off, saying she could not discussed details on an ongoing investigation. \n\n\"Through these arrests we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring,\" Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4. \n\nSweden is not raising its terror threat level -- which is currently at 3, with 5 as the highest -- and there is \"no reason for the public to be alarmed,\" she said. \n\n\"These arrests have not changed this threat level,\" Kvarnstrom added. \n\nAn art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests. \n\nA party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time, with about 500

The Union Army fought and defeated the Confederate Army during the war. At least two and a half million men served in the Union Army; almost all were volunteers.

The U.S. Army consisted of ten regiments of infantry, four of artillery, two of cavalry, two of dragoons, and three of mounted infantry. The regiments were scattered widely. Of the 197 companies in the army, 179 occupied 79 isolated posts in the West, and the remaining 18 manned garrisons east of the Mississippi River, mostly along the Canada\u2013United States border and on the Atlantic coast. \n\nWith the Southern slave states declaring secession from the Union, and with this drastic shortage of men in the army, President Abraham Lincoln called on the states to raise a force of 75,000 men for three months to put down the insurrection. Lincoln's call forced the border states to choose sides, and four seceded, making the Confederacy eleven states strong.

Mr. Catherwood's Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the marching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of this the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel's regiment. It was Virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of the troops, and the crowd had cheered her. It was Virginia who flew to the piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration of the girls and the delight of Mr. Catherwood who applauded her spirit despite the trouble which weighed upon him. Once more the crowd had cheered,--and hesitated. But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive, and the people followed.

ongoing investigation into whether former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez is connected to an unsolved double homicide in Boston last year. \n\nAlexander Bradley and John Alcorn Jr. were ordered to answer the questions of a grand jury investigating the fatal drive-by shooting of Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, outside a Boston nightclub in July 2012. \n\nBradley, however, failed to appear before Superior Court Judge Joan Alexander in Hartford, Connecticut, on Tuesday to respond to the subpoena, and the judge issued an arrest warrant for him, according to court officials. \n\nHernandez pleads not guilty \n\nBradley's New York-based attorney, David Jaroslawicz, told CNN he wasn't aware of the warrant or the subpoena and declined to say whether he has talked with his client about the grand jury matter. \n\nBradley filed a civil suit against Hernandez in federal court, saying the former football player shot him in the face, causing Bradley to lose sight in one eye, after the men visited a strip club in Miami earlier this year, according to the lawsuit. \n\nIn July, Bradley testified before a separate grand jury in Fall River, Massachusetts, that later indicted Hernandez on a charge of murder in the death of a friend, Odin Lloyd, June 17. \n\nHernandez pleaded not guilty last week to that charge and weapons counts. \n\nAlcorn, 21, from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, became involved in the investigation last month, when a friend of his, Jailene Diaz, told police a gun found in her car after a crash may have belonged to Alcorn and his friends, according to police documents obtained by CNN.

Historically, the caliphates were polities based in Islam which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires. During the medieval period, three major caliphates existed: the Rashidun Caliphate (632\u2013661), the Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750) and the Abbasid Caliphate (750\u20131258). The fourth major caliphate, the Ottoman Caliphate, established by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, was a manifestation whereby the Ottoman rulers claimed caliphal authority. During the history of Islam, several other Muslim states, almost all of them hereditary monarchies, have claimed to be caliphates. \n\nPrior to the rise of Muhammad and the unification of the Arab tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam, the tribes of Arabia followed a pre-Islamic Arab polytheism, lived as self-governing sedentary and nomadic communities and often raided their neighbouring tribes. Following the conquests under Muhammad of the Arabian Peninsula, the region became unified and most of the tribes adopted Islam. The first caliphate, the Rashidun Caliphate, was established immediately after Muhammad's death in 632. The four Rashidun caliphs, who directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, were chosen through \"shura, \"a process of community consultation that some consider to be an early form of Islamic democracy. The fourth caliph, Ali, who, unlike the prior three, was from the same clan as Muhammad (Banu Hashim), is considered by Shia Muslims to be the first rightful caliph and Imam after Muhammad. Ali reigned during the First Fitna (656\u2013661), a civil war between supporters of Ali and supporters of the assassinated previous caliph, Uthman, from Banu Umayya, as well as rebels in Egypt; the war led to the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate under Muawiyah I in 661.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who came after Muhammad to lead the Muslims?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When did Muhammad die?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is a caliphate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is a caliph?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was the first caliphate?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which one was second?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When was that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which one was next?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When did that one exist?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was the 4th?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What religion were caliphates based in?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was unique about the 4th caliph?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was his clan's name?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1248, "span_end": 1270, "span_text": "the Rashidun Caliphate", "input_text": "The Rashidun Caliphate.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1326, "span_end": 1329, "span_text": "632", "input_text": "632.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 28, "span_end": 83, "span_text": "a territory under the leadership of an Islamic steward ", "input_text": "A territory under the leadership of an Islamic steward.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 102, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "a person considered a religious successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad", "input_text": "A person considered a religious successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1248, "span_end": 1270, "span_text": "the Rashidun Caliphate", "input_text": "the Rashidun Caliphate", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 455, "span_end": 477, "span_text": " the Umayyad Caliphate", "input_text": "the Umayyad Caliphate", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 479, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "661\u2013750", "input_text": "661\u2013750.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 492, "span_end": 513, "span_text": "the Abbasid Caliphate", "input_text": "The Abbasid Caliphate.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 515, "span_end": 523, "span_text": "750\u20131258", "input_text": "750\u20131258.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 553, "span_end": 575, "span_text": " the Ottoman Caliphate", "input_text": "The Ottoman Caliphate.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 901, "span_end": 921, "span_text": "he Arabian Peninsula", "input_text": "The Arabian Peninsula.", "turn_id": 11, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1605, "span_end": 1639, "span_text": "was from the same clan as Muhammad", "input_text": "He was from the same clan as Muhammad.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1571, "span_end": 1574, "span_text": "Ali", "input_text": "Ali.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1641, "span_end": 1652, "span_text": "Banu Hashim", "input_text": "Banu Hashim.", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "Caliphate.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3pj71z61r42f85bxuzhcw6plsg2919", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Stratemeyer___Dave Porter and the Runaways.txt/CHAPTER XVIII_8571a99d7871d0a4924d32760bff684e001282974c14819ccb95a08", "story": "CHAPTER XVIII \n\nTHE MEETING ON THE ROAD \n\nThere was an intense silence, following the announcement of Jason Sparr that he intended to send Dave and his chums to prison for attempting to blow up the hotel.

She was such a kind old lady. I loved going to her house on holiday. She had been sick for the last few years and, though my job had taken me away across the town, I tried to visit her as much as possible. I helped with the shopping, the cooking and the cleaning and taking her pet cat Mazy to the vet. \n\nSad as her passing away was, what happened to Mazy was even more worrying. Because aunt Suzy had no children, there wasn't anyone who seemed to care for her beloved cat friend. I would have taken her in a short time, but my apartment doesn't allow pets. First, we talked with her neighbors. Mr. Jenkins, who was alone and lived across the street, wasn't interested. Joe and Sally who lived next door had a small child with serious skin allergies . My aunt's best friend Molly who had lived just down the road was unable to take care of herself as she had serious health problems. \n\nSecond, we thought about our family members. My brother Bobby and his wife Jill were _ at once as they aren't cat people. My cousin in California was a bit interested, but we weren't sure about the trip as Mazy was nearly as old as my aunt (in cat years!). Finally, we came to the local humane society to see whether they would be able to help her find a new home. The problem was that most people and families only welcomed a smart little cat into their home, not a dull old one. \n\nIn the end, we had to put Mazy to sleep. I had spoken with the vet and realized it was possible for the best. It was so hard to lose aunt Suzy and then have nowhere for Mazy to live. A few months went by and I had gone to my aunt's house to clear out some of her belongings. I happened to see her mailman. Jerry and we started to talk about my aunt when he asked about Mazy. I told him that we had to put Mazy to sleep because we couldn't find a home for her. Jerry got really quiet. \"I promised Suzy that if anything ever happened to her, I'd take care of Mazy\", he said sadly. \"Suzy always said she'd told her lawyer the arrangement.\" \n\nHearing this, my heart sank to my feet and I almost cried. The saddest part, I realized, was this all could have been avoided. I guess we were just so busy in those final months that we didn't think about it. We could have called my aunt's lawyer to take care of it in less than 10 minutes. I'll never forgive myself for not thinking of it sooner.

THE SAUSAGE CHAPPIE \n\nThe personality that wins cost Archie two dollars in cash and a lot of embarrassment when he asked for it at the store. To buy a treatise of that name would automatically seem to argue that you haven't a winning personality already, and Archie was at some pains to explain to the girl behind the counter that he wanted it for a friend. The girl seemed more interested in his English accent than in his explanation, and Archie was uncomfortably aware, as he receded, that she was practising it in an undertone for the benefit of her colleagues and fellow-workers. However, what is a little discomfort, if endured in friendship's name? \n\nHe was proceeding up Broadway after leaving the store when he encountered Reggie van Tuyl, who was drifting along in somnambulistic fashion near Thirty-Ninth Street. \n\n\"Hullo, Reggie old thing!\" said Archie. \n\n\"Hullo!\" said Reggie, a man of few words. \n\n\"I've just been buying a book for Bill Brewster,\" went on Archie. \"It appears that old Bill--What's the matter?\" \n\nHe broke off his recital abruptly. A sort of spasm had passed across his companion's features. The hand holding Archie's arm had tightened convulsively. One would have said that Reginald had received a shock. \n\n\"It's nothing,\" said Reggie. \"I'm all right now. I caught sight of that fellow's clothes rather suddenly. They shook me a bit. I'm all right now,\" he said, bravely. \n\nArchie, following his friend's gaze, understood. Reggie van Tuyl was never at his strongest in the morning, and he had a sensitive eye for clothes. He had been known to resign from clubs because members exceeded the bounds in the matter of soft shirts with dinner-jackets. And the short, thick-set man who was standing just in front of them in attitude of restful immobility was certainly no dandy. His best friend could not have called him dapper.

Nor, since the half-crown must be disbursed on an escort for her, did the housewifely conscience object to the expedition, for Wilmet could not but long to thank the Superior and Sister Constance, and to obtain Dr. Lee's advice as to future management. Her coming was great joy to Cherry, who had dreaded the meeting almost with a sense of guilt, though still hoping Felix had been silent on her motive; and Wilmet did not betray him, but only treated her sister with a mixture of almost shy tenderness and reverence. Nor did Cherry dare to ask a question as to Wilmet's own affairs, nor even about Ferdinand Travis, lest she should seem to be leading in that direction.

For Ferdinand Travis was back again, rather amused at the family astonishment at the rapidity of his journey to America, which to his Transatlantic notions of travel was as nothing, and indeed had been chiefly performed in a big steamer, where he could smoke to his heart's content.

He did it unwillingly, although he did not ignore that what was going to happen in there was now absolutely beyond his control. He roamed irresolutely about for awhile, and at last wandered with careless steps towards the fire, which had been moved, from under the tree, close to the hut and a little to windward of its entrance. He squatted on his heels and began playing pensively with live embers, as was his habit when engrossed in thought, withdrawing his hand sharply and shaking it above his head when he burnt his fingers in a fit of deeper abstraction. Sitting there he could hear the murmur of the talk inside the hut, and he could distinguish the voices but not the words. Abdulla spoke in deep tones, and now and then this flowing monotone was interrupted by a querulous exclamation, a weak moan or a plaintive quaver of the old man. Yes. It was annoying not to be able to make out what they were saying, thought Babalatchi, as he sat gazing fixedly at the unsteady glow of the fire. But it will be right. All will be right. Abdulla inspired him with confidence. He came up fully to his expectation. From the very first moment when he set his eye on him he felt sure that this man--whom he had known by reputation only--was very resolute. Perhaps too resolute. Perhaps he would want to grasp too much later on. A shadow flitted over Babalatchi's face.

The International Space Station continues to provide valuable knowledge about spaceflight. But an earlier space station, Skylab, helped make the current space project possible. \n\nCanadian astronaut Chris Hadfield sang aboard the International Space Station on May 12, 2013. His music video has become extremely popular. The astronaut played his own version of David Bowie's song Space Oddity. He performed while floating weightlessly, with images of planet earth and space appearing in the window behind him. \n\nChris Hadfield recently returned home after nearly five months on the space station. For him, the long flight produced a hit video on YouTube and no major physical problems. But 40 years ago, scientists did not know how humans would react to long-term spaceflight. To find out, NASA, the American space agency, launched Skylab in May, 1973. Over nearly a year, three teams of astronauts visited Skylab for stays of between 28 to 84 days. They learned how people react to extended periods in space. \n\nGerald Carr commanded Skylab 4. He spoke at a NASA event marking the 40th anniversary of Skylab's launch. He said that the loss of the body's muscle mass was a main concern. Astronauts on Skylab used exercise equipment to stay strong.

Sichuan was referred to in ancient Chinese sources as Ba-Shu (\u5df4\u8700), an abbreviation of the kingdoms of Ba and Shu which existed within the Sichuan Basin. Ba included Chongqing and the land in eastern Sichuan along the Yangtze and some tributary streams, while Shu included today's Chengdu, its surrounding plain and adjacent territories in western Sichuan. \n\nThe existence of the early state of Shu was poorly recorded in the main historical records of China. It was, however, referred to in the Book of Documents as an ally of the Zhou. Accounts of Shu exist mainly as a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends recorded in local annals such as the Chronicles of Huayang compiled in the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), with folk stories such as that of Emperor Duyu (\u675c\u5b87) who taught the people agriculture and transformed himself into a cuckoo after his death. The existence of a highly developed civilization with an independent bronze industry in Sichuan eventually came to light with an archaeological discovery in 1986 at a small village named Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site, believed to be an ancient city of Shu, was initially discovered by a local farmer in 1929 who found jade and stone artefacts. Excavations by archaeologists in the area yielded few significant finds until 1986 when two major sacrificial pits were found with spectacular bronze items as well as artefacts in jade, gold, earthenware, and stone. This and other discoveries in Sichuan contest the conventional historiography that the local culture and technology of Sichuan were undeveloped in comparison to the technologically and culturally \"advanced\" Yellow River valley of north-central China.

It is generally accepted that Kurt G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. However, G\u00f6del could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics. \n\nWhitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book The Aims of Education and Other Essays, which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927. The essay from which Aims of Education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the Mathematical Association. In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called \"inert ideas\" \u2013 ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture.

This time he made it to graduation, but he didn't want to do the work of a minister. His friends encouraged him to follow his interest in science. Luckily, Charles was invited to sail on the Beagle as an unpaid scientist after graduation. The Beagle was to travel to South America and then around the world. Their task was to make maps of the places they visited. On December 27th, 1831. Charles Darwin sailed from England on the Beagle. The trip was planned to last two years. In fact, it lasted five.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \"Brotherly Leader\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism and serving as Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. \n\nThe son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder, Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Founding a revolutionary cell within the military, in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic. Ruling by decree, he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments.

On Sunday night, the designer celebrated the 25th anniversary of his fashion label with 25 limited-edition pieces inspired by American legends. \n\n\"It's been an amazing journey from where I started,\" Hilfiger told CNN as looks derived from classic style icons hit the runway. \n\n\"Grace Kelly--we have a halter dress inspired by her and a sleeveless trench, but with a modern twist,\" Hilfiger said. \n\nNext came a Steve McQueen-inspired navy pea coat, a James Dean-inspired leather motorcycle jacket and a Debbie Harry-inspired hooded sweater. \n\nHilfiger said music, film and pop culture have always helped spark his ideas.

By its fitful glimmer Yvonne could vaguely perceive the tall figure of her guide as he stepped out with noiseless yet firm tread, his shoulder brushing against the side of the nearest house as he kept closely within the shadow of its high wall. The sight of his broad back thrilled her. She had fallen to imagining whether this was not perchance that gallant and all-powerful Scarlet Pimpernel himself: the mysterious friend of whom her dear milor so often spoke with an admiration that was akin to worship. He too was probably tall and broad--for English gentlemen were usually built that way; and Yvonne's over-excited mind went galloping on the wings of fancy, and in her heart she felt that she was glad that she had suffered so much, and then lived through such a glorious moment as this. \n\nNow from the narrow unpaved yard in front of the house the guide turned sharply to the right. Yvonne could only distinguish outlines. The streets of Nantes were familiar to her, and she knew pretty well where she was. The lanthorn inside the clock tower of Le Bouffay guided her--it was now on her right--the house wherein she had been kept a prisoner these past three days was built against the walls of the great prison house. She knew that she was in the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie.

All four of them skip the actual Resurrection. That is, we never see Jesus waken. The first inkling of change comes when a few women close to him visit the tomb.

From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard.

They were completely different from my own family, yet I felt at home with them immediately. Jane White and I became friends at school, and her family welcomed me like a long-lost cousin. \n\nIn my family, it was always important to place blame when anything bad happened. \n\n\"Who did this? \"my mother would scream about a dirty kitchen. \n\n\"This is all your fault, Katharine, \"my father would insist when the cat got out or the dishwasher broke. \n\nFrom the time we were little, my sister, brothers and I told on each other. We set a place for blame at the dinner table. \n\nBut the Whites didn't worry about who had done what. They picked up the pieces and moved on with their lives. The beauty of this was driven home to me the summer Jane died. \n\nIn July, the White sisters and I decided to take a car trip from their home in Florida to New York. The two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, were college students, and the youngest, Amy, had recently turned sixteen. Proud of having a new driver's license ,Amy was excited about practicing her driving on the trip. She showed off her license to everyone she met. \n\nThe big sisters shared the driving of Sarah's new car during the first part of the trip, but when they reached less crowded areas, they let Amy take over. Somewhere in South Carolina, we pulled off the highway to eat. After lunch, Amy got behind the wheel. She came to a crossroads with a stop sign. Whether she was nervous or just didn't see the sign no one would ever know, but Amy continued into the crossroads without stopping. The driver of a large truck, unable to stop in time, ran into our car. \n\nJane was killed immediately. \n\nI was slightly injured. The most difficult thing that I've ever done was to call the Whites to tell them about the accident and that Jane had died. Painful as it was for me to lose a good friend, I knew that it was far worse for them to lose a child. \n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. White arrived at the hospital, they found their two daughters sharing a room. Sarah had a few cuts on the head; Amy's leg was broken. They hugged us all and cried tears of sadness and of joy at seeing their daughters. They wiped away the girls' tears and made a few jokes at Amy as she learned to use her crutches . \n\nTo both of their daughters, and especially to Amy, over and over they simply said, \"We're so glad that you're alive. \" \n\nI was astonished. No blame. No accusations. \n\nLater, I asked the Whites why they never talked about the fact that Amy was driving and had run a stop sign. \n\nMrs. White said, \"Jane's gone, and we miss her terribly. Nothing we say or do will ever bring her back. But Amy has her whole life ahead of her. How can she lead a full and happy life if she feels we blame her for her sister's death? \" \n\nThey were right. Amy graduated from the University of California and got married several years ago.

He would remain at Mr. Seely's, and then the waggonette should pick him up. This had been explained to Mrs. Bolton. 'John will remain in town, because he has so much to do with Mr. Seely,' Hester had said; 'and Richard will call here at about twelve.' All her plans had thus been made known, and Mrs. Bolton was aware at what hour the bolts must be drawn and the things removed. \n\nBut, as the time drew nearer, her dislike to a sudden commencement of absolute hostilities became stronger,--to hostilities which would seem to have no sanction from Mr. Bolton himself, because he would then be absent. And he too, though as he lay awake through the dreary hours of the long night he said no word about the plan, felt, and felt more strongly as the dawn was breaking, that it would be mean to leave his daughter with a farewell kiss, knowing as he would do that he was leaving her within prison-bars, leaving her to the charge of jailers.

Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million. Now, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%. Indeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall. In the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers. Back in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out. Some students were using their computers to visit unauthorized websites. But teachers have the ability to keep an eye on where students have been on the Web and to stop them. \"That is the worst when they disable you,\" says eighth-grade honors student Jamie Bassell. The habit is rubbing off on parents. \"I taught my mom to use e-mail,\" says another eighth-grader, Katherine Hypolite. \"And now she's taking computer classes.

From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30\u201360% of Europe's total population. In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350\u2013375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century. The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century. \n\nThe plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338\u201339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading.

Do you know what he was doing?\" The child looked at him with a kind of half attention, his eyes forward but not yet engaged. They were a paler blue than his father's as if they might have faded like the shirt; one of them listed, almost imperceptibly , toward the outer rim. \"He was in a path,\" Sheppard said, \"and he had his hand in a garbage can. He was trying to get something to eat out of it.\" He paused to let this soak in. \"He was hungry,\" he finished, and tried to pierce the child's conscience with his gaze.

It was hopeless. Almost any fault would have been preferable to selfishness--a violent temper, even a tendency to lie. The child turned the bottle of tomato sauce upside-down and began thumping sauce onto the cake. Sheppard's look of pain increased. \"You are ten and Rufus Johnson is fourteen,\" he said. \"Yet, I'm sure your shirts would fit Rufus.\" Rufus Johnson was a boy whom he had been trying to help at the reformatory for the past year. He had been released two months ago. \"When he was in the reformatory, he looked pretty good, but when I saw him yesterday, he was skin and bones. He hasn't been eating cake with peanut butter on it for breakfast.\" The child paused. \"It's not fresh,\" he said. \"That's why I have to put stuff on it.\" Sheppard turned his face to the window at the end of the bar. The side lawn, green and even, sloped fifty feet or so down to a small suburban wood. When his wife was living, they had often eaten outside, even breakfast on the grass. He had never noticed then that the child was selfish. ks5u \"Listen to me,\" he said, turning back to him, \"look at me and listen.\" The boy looked at him. At least his eyes were forward. \"I gave Rufus a key to the house when he left the reformatory---to show my confidence in him and so he would have a place he could come to and feel welcome any time. He didn't use it, but I think he'll use it now because he's seen me and he's hungry. And if he doesn't use it, I'm going out and find him and bring him here. I can't see a child eating out of garbage cans.\" The boy frowned. It was dawning upon him that something of his was threatened. Sheppard's mouth stretched in disgust. \"Rufus's father died before he was born,\" he said. \"His mother is in the state penitentiary . He was raised by his grandfather in a shack without water or electricity and the old man beat him every day. How would you like to belong to a family like that?\" \"I don't know\" the child said lamely. \"Well, you might think about it sometime,\" Sheppard said. Sheppard was City Recreational Director. On Saturday he worked at the reformatory as a counselor, receiving nothing for it but the satisfaction of knowing he was helping boys no one else cared about. Johnson was the most intelligent boy he had worked with.

In the southern part of the state, in a region known as Aridoamerica, Chichimeca people survived by hunting, gathering, and farming between AD 300 and 1300. The Chichimeca are the ancestors of the Tepehuan people. \n\nDuring the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the \"Grito de Dolores\". Hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people. Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, Mexico City, but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from Guadalajara, Jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in return for Hidalgo's surrender. A short time later, he and his supporters were captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baj\u00e1n (Norias de Baj\u00e1n) on March 21, 1811 and taken to the city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on September 24, 1810.

He did not work on the new car. His organization studies trends and changes in the auto industry. It took 44 hours to print the new car at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. Over the next few days, the car's designers installed additional parts. These included the car's engine, brakes and tires. Then, early on September 13, Jay Rogers climbed into the car, started its engine and drove the vehicle onto the street. Rogers helped found Local Motors. It's the Arizona-based company behind the Strati. Two weeks later, his team printed a second Strati, and just as fast, at a fair in New York City. Justin Fishkin, a local Motors official, sees the Strati as a window into the future. Today, car buyers are limited in their choice of a vehicle. They can order only what car companies have already designed. But in the future, he says, you may be able to design your own car online and then get it printed to order. Manufacturing experts say 3-D printing has begun to revolutionize how they make things. The technology has been around for decades. But these machines used to be so expensive that only large companies could afford them. In the last few years, though, that has changed. Many of the machines are now inexpensive enough for small companies--or even individuals --to own. Some local libraries make them available to the public. High Schools are beginning to use them in classrooms. Wide access to these printers means people can now design and print a wide variety of new things. The car's printer is a one-of-a-kind device. The technology behind the 3-D printer used in Chicago is an example of additive manufacturing. This process builds solid objects, slice by slice, from the bottom up. (\"Strati\" means layers, in Italian.) A mechanical arm moves a _ from one side to another, back and forth. As it moves, the nozzle deposits a liquid--often melted plastic or metal (but it could be food, concrete or even cells) --that quickly hardens or bonds to become solid or semi-solid. This creates a single, thin layer. Once a layer is complete, the printer starts depositing the next one. \"There's a lot of interest in 3-D printing in the auto industry,\" says Schroeder. Right now, the technology is particularly useful for building models of cars or car parts. To compete with current auto manufacturers, the 3-D printer would have to increase in a hurry, Schroeder says. By contrast, he notes, a Ford F-150 pickup truck rolls off an assembly line at a rate of roughly one per minute. To print as many Stratis would require many more printers. Schroeder says he doesn't see 3-D printing soon taking over for such high-volume manufacturing. But, he adds, \"Who knows what will happen in the long term?\" Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee designed the 3-D printer used in Chicago. Lonnie Love, a research scientist at the lab, led the effort. Additive manufacturing often is slow and expensive. It also may produce materials that are unreliable, Love says. So for two years, his team searched for ways to make 3-D printing better. They built new machines and tested them over and over. All of that work paid off: their new machine is fast and uses less expensive material than earlier printers. In addition, it prints a plastic embedded with fibers of carbon to produce a stronger material. This helps ensure the material won't crack or break under pressure.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did the world get a glimpse of on Saturday?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does it roll on?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What parts were not factory built?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What's Shroeder's opinion about it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's his position?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where at?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What happened on September 13th?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did he help create?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where's the company based?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where will you be able to design a car in the future?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 46, "span_end": 88, "span_text": "the world got its first look at the Strati", "input_text": "the Strati", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 155, "span_end": 179, "span_text": "It rolls on four wheels,", "input_text": "wheels", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 183, "span_end": 231, "span_text": " its body and chassis weren't built in a factory", "input_text": "its body and chassis", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 411, "span_end": 470, "span_text": " the Strati definitely looks different,\" says Greg Schroede", "input_text": "the Strati definitely looks different", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 457, "span_end": 500, "span_text": "Greg Schroeder, a senior research engineer ", "input_text": "senior research engineer", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 503, "span_end": 537, "span_text": "the Center for Automotive Research", "input_text": "the Center for Automotive Research", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 940, "span_text": "Jay Rogers climbed into the car", "input_text": "Jay Rogers climbed into the car", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1000, "span_end": 1032, "span_text": "Rogers helped found Local Motors", "input_text": "Local Motors", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1033, "span_end": 1065, "span_text": " It's the Arizona-based company ", "input_text": "Arizona", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1417, "span_end": 1463, "span_text": "you may be able to design your own car online ", "input_text": "you may be able to design your own car online", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high13841.txt"}]
