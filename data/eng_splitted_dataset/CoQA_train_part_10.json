He said that encouraging visitors to set a value on museums and art galleries, which have been free since 2001, would work extremely well. Mr. Johnson held up New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art as a model. Although New York's museums are officially free, visitors are strongly encouraged to pay a recommended entry fee of $20. At the Met, entry is impossible without first going to the ticket desk. Mr. Johnson's spokesman later admitted that free admission was a \"huge draw\" for London, but he said, \"Having visited the Met last week, the mayor is impressed by how they maximize voluntary contributions and believes there are lessons to be learnt.\" Mark Jones, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told The Timesthat the museum already requested a PS3 donation but was not as forceful as New York's institutions. He said, \"I'm not in favor of anything that makes people feel they won't want to go because they feel like they will have to pay.\" When entrance fees to national museums were decided not to be charged here in 2001, there was a 70 percent increase in visitor numbers in the first year. Political parties have since been unwilling to suggest change, despite concerns about cost. Hugo Swire, the former Shadow Culture Secretary, was dismissed in 2007 for suggesting that \"museums and galleries should have the right to charge if they wish\". Some in the art community argue, however, that free entrance has done little to increase the breadth of visitors and has caused shortfalls in the budget for the museums. In response to it, Colin Tweedy, chief executive of Arts & Business, said that Britain was \"leading the world\" in allowing its treasures to be freely available. He said, \"To return to museum charging would be a return to the dark ages.\" Ben Bradshaw, the Culture Secretary, said, \"The mayor showed his true intention when he suggested those who could afford it should be encouraged to contribute to the arts. I believe _ is a disaster for the culture, arts and sport.\" He thinks that free museums and galleries have once been one of this Government's great successes.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Boris Johnson?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did he speak of the other day?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How long have museums been free there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is Ben Bradshaw?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Does he want voluntary admissions?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is Johnson basing his opinion on admissions on?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does this museum recommend?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What sort of donation is already asked for?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who is Mark Jones?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does he agree with admissions fee?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was the increase after museums went free/", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who was the former Shadow Culture Secretary?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When was he fired?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What for?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How does the art community feel about admissions fee?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who is Colin Tweedy?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What does he feel about Britain allowing free admissions?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 75, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "the mayor of London", "input_text": "the mayor of London", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 32, "span_end": 58, "span_text": "\"voluntary\" admission fees", "input_text": "\"voluntary\" admission fees", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 213, "span_end": 223, "span_text": "since 2001", "input_text": "since 2001", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1900, "span_end": 1917, "span_text": "Culture Secretary", "input_text": "Culture Secretary", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1816, "span_end": 1879, "span_text": "To return to museum charging would be a return to the dark ages", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 272, "span_end": 309, "span_text": "New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art", "input_text": "New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 424, "span_end": 441, "span_text": " entry fee of $20", "input_text": "entry fee of $20", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 871, "span_end": 875, "span_text": " PS3", "input_text": "PS3", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 777, "span_end": 820, "span_text": " director of the Victoria and Albert Museum", "input_text": "director of the Victoria and Albert Museum", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 949, "span_end": 966, "span_text": "m not in favor of", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1163, "span_end": 1184, "span_text": " 70 percent increase ", "input_text": "70 percent increase", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1314, "span_end": 1324, "span_text": "Hugo Swire", "input_text": "Hugo Swire", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1380, "span_end": 1384, "span_text": "2007", "input_text": "2007", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1386, "span_end": 1473, "span_text": "or suggesting that \"museums and galleries should have the right to charge if they wish\"", "input_text": "for suggesting that \"museums and galleries should have the right to charge if they wish\"", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1486, "span_end": 1506, "span_text": " art community argue", "input_text": "They agree", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1678, "span_end": 1712, "span_text": "chief executive of Arts & Business", "input_text": "chief executive of Arts & Business", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1713, "span_end": 1804, "span_text": " said that Britain was \"leading the world\" in allowing its treasures to be freely available", "input_text": "He likes it", "turn_id": 17}], "name": "high20858.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3azhrg4cu4ktme1zh7c2ro3pnv703z", "filename": "middle7386.txt", "story": "It is reported that in the near future robots and humans will probably work together to create jazz.

Previous robots had the ability to find common connections between things. But Chella suggests that a conscious robot should be able to go a step further and find new connections. The Telenoid is of this kind. \"This work raises interesting questions about the connection between consciousness and music creating.\" says Philippe Pasquier, a musician needs a physical body. Pasquer argues that the robot musician is faced with a big challenge. \"Its software has already been developed and it can imitate The Beatles, a famous band. However, what made The Beatles famous were not only their songs but their wonderful performance of the songs,\" he says. It is not clear how a robot would perform music a new way. But by imitating humans, the Telenoid robot could provide some useful information. What is important is that human musicians often listen to and compare music made by others for a long time before creating music of their own.

Initial speculation was that Gadhafi was in one of those groups, but on Thursday a second senior U.S. official said the United States now has a list of officials from Libya who were in both convoys. \n\nThere were \"no marquee names,\" or anyone who was named in U.N. Security Council resolutions, the second source said. The official would not say who was in the convoys but said Gadhafi's security chief was not among them, refuting reports that said he left in the convoy. \n\nThe Nigerien government is talking to the NTC about what the new Libyan leadership wants to do with those in the convoy but the NTC hasn't decided whether it's worth it to bring them back, the source said. \n\nLibyans are leading the search for Gadhafi. The Central Intelligence Agency has agents in the area, and the United Kingdom, France, Jordan and Qater have special forces in the country as well, NATO and U.S. defense officials tell CNN.

Many of the site's writers are postgraduates and some work for research institutions. Articles on the website are written in a less-formal tone than those in traditional journals. \n\n\"Ars Technica\" was privately owned until May 2008, when it was sold to Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital, the online division of Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications. Cond\u00e9 Nast purchased the site, along with two others, for $25 million and added it to the company's \"Wired\" Digital group, which also includes \"Wired\" and, formerly, Reddit. The staff mostly works from home and has offices in Boston, Chicago, London, New York City, and San Francisco. \n\nThe operations of \"Ars Technica\" are funded primarily by online advertising, and it has offered a paid subscription service since 2001. The website generated controversy in 2010, when it experimentally prevented readers who used advertisement-blocking software from viewing the site. \n\nKen Fisher and Jon Stokes created the \"Ars Technica\" website and limited liability company in 1998. Its purpose was to publish computer hardware- and software-related news articles and guides; in their words, \"the best multi-OS, PC hardware, and tech coverage possible while\u00a0... having fun, being productive, and being as informative and as accurate as possible\". \"Ars technica\" is a Latin phrase that translates to \"technological art\". The website published news, reviews, guides, and other content of interest to computer enthusiasts.

Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend \"Venite Ad Me Omnes\". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary. \n\nAs at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

These included not only bourgeois people but also working-class people accused of counter-revolutionary sympathies. \n\nStalinist industrialization was officially designed to accelerate the development towards communism, stressing that such rapid industrialization was needed because the country was previously economically backward in comparison with other countries; and that it was needed in order to face the challenges posed by internal and external enemies of communism. Rapid industrialization was accompanied with mass collectivization of agriculture and rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization converted many small villages into industrial cities. To accelerate the development of industrialization, Stalin pragmatically created joint venture contracts with major American private enterprises, such as Ford Motor Company, that under state supervision assisted in developing the basis of industry of the Soviet economy from the late 1920s to 1930s.

Adult daughters are often expected to caregiver for older parents. In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time. \n\n\"I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,\" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline.

It's the kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't cure,\" she said. \n\nAbout 6 million Americans provide care to elderly relatives or friends living outside of nursing homes. Laurel Kennedy, author of \"The Daughter Trap\" (Thomas Dunne Books, $25.95), says that women bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- about 70 percent of hands-on care giving such as bathing. \n\n\"I want to be clear: Women don't hate this,\" Kennedy said. \"What they hate is that everyone just assumes they'll do it.\" \n\nKennedy is calling for _ equal to the rise of affordable child care and day care: Employers should help working caregivers by offering accommodations. Men should step up more often.

He had never returned to his lodging, nor been seen anywhere, except in the stable, in which his horse had been put to stand--he had himself saddled his horse, and taken him from the stall, and from that moment nothing further could be learnt of him in Saumur. De Lescure and Henri made the most minute inquiries--but in vain; had he destroyed himself, or hid himself in the town, his horse would certainly have been found; it was surmised that he had started for Paris on some mad speculation; and though his friends deeply grieved at his misconduct, his absence, when they had so much to do and to think of was in itself, felt as a relief. \n\nAfter remaining about a week in Saumur, the army was disbanded--or rather disbanded itself, for every effort was made, to keep together as great a body of men as possible. An attempt was made to garrison the town; and for this purpose, the leaders undertook to pay about one thousand men, at a certain rate per day, for their services, while they remained under arms in Saumur, but the idea, after a very short time, was abandoned; the men would not stay away from their homes, and in spite of the comforts which were procured for them, and the pay which was promised, the garrison very quickly dissolved.

Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's subjective perception of a sound, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower. \n\nThis creates a linear pitch space in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69.

\n\n\"Better arm yourselves with clubs,\" suggested Nick Jasniff. \"Remember, we are only three to five.\" \n\n\"Maybe we had better--er--go away,\" returned the money-lender's son, hesitatingly. \n\n\"No, I am going to see the thing out,\" answered Jasniff. \n\n\"So am I,\" added Merwell. \"Don't go, Nat--they won't dare to fight--with the girls looking on.\" \n\n\"Whoa, there! Whoa!\" came a cry from behind the two touring cars, and looking back the boys and girls saw a man drive up on a buckboard drawn by a spirited horse. \n\n\"Why, if it isn't Jed Sully!\" cried Ben. \n\n\"Who is he?\" questioned Sam. \n\n\"Sort of a roadmaster in these parts. I suppose he is going around, inspecting the roads and bridges.\" \n\n\"Then he ought to be able to tell us about this road!\" put in Phil, quickly. \n\n\"Hello! What's the meaning of this?\" demanded Jed Sully, after alighting. And he strode forward and confronted the boys. \n\n\"How are you, Mr. Sully?\" said Dave, for he had met the roadmaster before. \n\n\"Oh, so it's you, Dave! Blocked up, eh?\" And the roadmaster looked first at Dave and his chums and then at those standing on the other side of the barrier. \"Who did this?\" \n\n\"They did,\" answered Roger, and pointed to the other crowd.

It is named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples: kilohertz (10 Hz, kHz), megahertz (10 Hz, MHz), gigahertz (10 Hz, GHz), and terahertz (10 Hz, THz). \n\nSome of the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. It is also used to describe the speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven. \n\nThe hertz is equivalent to cycles per second, i.e., \"1/second\" or formula_1. The International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second as \"the duration of 9\u00a0192\u00a0631\u00a0770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom\" and then adds the obvious conclusion: \"It follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium 133 atom is exactly 9\u00a0192\u00a0631\u00a0770 hertz, \u03bd(hfs Cs) = 9\u00a0192\u00a0631\u00a0770 Hz.\" \n\nIn English, \"hertz\" is also used as the plural form. As an SI unit, Hz can be prefixed; commonly used multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 10\u00a0Hz), MHz (megahertz, 10\u00a0Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 10\u00a0Hz) and THz (terahertz, 10\u00a0Hz). One hertz simply means \"one cycle per second\" (typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle); 100\u00a0Hz means \"one hundred cycles per second\", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event\u2014for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1\u00a0Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2\u00a0Hz. The occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second (1/s or s) in general or, in the specific case of radioactive decay, in becquerels. Whereas 1\u00a0Hz is 1 cycle per second, 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radionuclide event per second.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is a hertz?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does it measure?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Like what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How did it get its name?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who is he?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is it used only in English-speaking countries?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How do you know that?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What time span is used in defining the measurement?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long is a second?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who decided that?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 3, "span_end": 55, "span_text": " hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency", "input_text": "the derived unit of frequency", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 418, "span_end": 483, "span_text": "the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves ", "input_text": "sine waves", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 568, "span_end": 660, "span_text": "It is also used to describe the speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven.

Perhaps Herr Molk had not been so silent and discreet as would have been becoming in a man so highly placed, and perhaps Peter himself had let slip a word to some confidential friend who had betrayed him. Be this as it might, all Nuremberg knew of Peter's good fortune, and he soon found that he should have no peace till the thing was completed. \"She is quite well enough, I am sure,\" said Peter to Madame Staubach, \"and if there is anything amiss she can finish getting well afterwards.\" Madame Staubach was sufficiently eager herself that Linda should be married without delay; but, nevertheless, she was angry at being so pressed, and used rather sharp language in explaining to Peter that he would not be allowed to dictate on such a subject. \"Ah! well; if it isn't this year it won't be next,\" said Peter, on one occasion when he had determined to show his power.

It was now near the end of November, and though Linda still kept her room, her aunt could not see that she was suffering from any real illness.

MADONNA'S INGRATITUDE \n\nWe stayed in Fossombrone little more than a half-hour, and having made a hasty supper we resumed our way, giving out that we wished to reach Fano ere we slept. And so by the first hour of night Fossombrone was a league or so behind us, and we were advancing briskly towards the sea. Overhead a moon rode at the full in a clear sky, and its light was reflected by the snow, so that we were not discomforted by any darkness. We fell, presently, into a gentler pace, for, after all, there could be no advantage in reaching Pesaro before morning, and as we rode we talked, and I made bold to ask her the cause of her flight from Rome. \n\nShe told me then that she was Madonna Paola Sforza di Santafior, and that Pope Alexander, in his nepotism and his desire to make rich and powerful alliances for his family, had settled upon her as the wife for his nephew, Ignacio Borgia. He had been emboldened to this step by the fact that her only protector was her brother, Filippo di Santafior, whom they had sought to coerce.

The city served as the coronation site and legislative center of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1536 to 1783, and has been home to many Slovak, Hungarian and German historical figures. \n\nBratislava is the political, cultural and economic centre of Slovakia. It is the seat of the Slovak president, the parliament and the Slovak Executive. It is home to several universities, museums, theatres, galleries and other important cultural and educational institutions. Many of Slovakia's large businesses and financial institutions also have headquarters there. \n\nThe capital of Slovakia is the eighth best city for freelancers to live in, mostly because of fast internet and the low taxes.

Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out. Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game. To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot. Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap. A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno. What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game. Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy. Billy sat down on the grass to wait. Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch. Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out. Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her. Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine. Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream. Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite. Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on. Juno immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her. Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds. Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat. The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again. Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream.

When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: \"I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,\" Hasnip said at the time. \"While I have nothing against the French.\" \n\nHasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. \n\nThe condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military.

Forbes reports that at least fifty rock stars have incomes between two million and six million dollars per year. \n\n\"It doesn't make sense,\" says Johnny Mathis, one of the older music millionaires, who made a million dollars a year when he was popular in 1950s. \"Performers aren't worth this kind of money. In fact, nobody is.\" \n\nBut the rock stars' admirers seem to disagree. Those who love rock music spend about two billion dollars a year for records. They pay 150 million to see rock stars in person. \n\nLuck is a key word for explaining the success of many. In 1972 one of the luckiest was Kon Mclean, who wrote and sang \"American Pie\". Mclean writes his own music, so he earns an additional two cents on every single record of the song. \n\nNeil Young who performs in torn blue jeans, sometimes sings to an audience of 10,000, each of whom has paid five dollars for a ticket. After paying expenses, Young leaves with about $ 18,000 in his blue jeans at the end of an evening. \n\nHow do the rock stars use their money? What do they do when the money starts pouring in like water? Most of the young stars simply show the money around. England's Elton John gave someone a $ 38,000 Rolls car and bought himself 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses, then lighted up and spelt :E-L-T-O-N. He also bought himself two cars, \"one for each foot\". \n\nMany rock stars live like Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane. Those performers return from a tour, pay their bills, and buy new toys. Then when they need money again, they do another tour. They save no money and live _ www.zxxk.com \n\nIn the end the rock stars' life is unrewarding. After two or three years riches and fame are gone. Left with his memories and his tax problems, the lonely star spends his remaining years trying to attract strangers.

Bourbaki had passed west only the week before, with all his army, upon his march to the relief of Belfort; and the railway was completely choked.

Of course you must know what you mean to tell him.\" Mary thought that she did know, but was not at the present moment disposed to make known her knowledge and therefore remained silent. \"You should remember how much this is to your papa and me and should speak out at once. Of course you need not tell Mr. Twentyman till the end of the time unless you like it.\" \n\n\"I thought I was to be left alone for two months.\" \n\n\"Mary, that is wicked.

Of course he will want to be prepared to give you what things will be necessary.\" Mrs. Masters had not as yet heard of Mr. Morton's cheque, and perhaps would not hear of it till her husband's bank book fell into her hands.

He had accomplished fully the great objects which had been the aim of his ambition. Darius was dead, and he was himself the undisputed master of all western Asia. His wealth was almost boundless. His power was supreme over what was, in his view, the whole known world. But, during the process of rising to this ascendency, his character was sadly changed. He lost the simplicity, the temperance, the moderation, and the sense of justice which characterized his early years. He adopted the dress and the luxurious manners of the Persians. He lived in the palaces of the Persian kings, imitating all their state and splendor. He became very fond of convivial entertainments and of wine, and often drank to excess. He provided himself a seraglio of three hundred and sixty young females, in whose company he spent his time, giving himself up to every form of effeminacy and dissipation. In a word, he was no longer the same man. The decision, the energy of character, the steady pursuit of great ends by prudence, forethought, patient effort, and self-denial, all disappeared; nothing now seemed to interest him but banquets, carousals, parties of pleasure, and whole days and nights spent in dissipation and vice.

He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot.

after he began working as an informant for immigration officials in the United States. \n\n\"The victim was concerned for his own well-being and the safety of his family,\" the documents said,

began to get suspicious, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said at a press conference. \n\nAllen said Gonzalez's exit from Mexico, combined with a raid on a cartel warehouse and the arrest of cartel lieutenant Pedro \"El Tigre\" Aranas Sanchez led cartel members to believe he might be working as an informant, Allen said. \n\nThen, a Mexican newspaper named Gonzalez as an informant in the arrest of the high-ranking cartel member, according to court documents. Police say Gonzales quickly became the target of his own cartel. \n\nPolice said Gonzalez knew if his fellow cartel members found him, he would likely be killed, police said. \n\nOn May 15, the cartel found him. \n\nHe was shot eight times outside his home in El Paso, Texas, police said. \n\nPfc.

Are the remains buried in a French castle really those of the master? Was the \"Mona Lisa\" a self-portrait in disguise ? \n\nA group of Italian scientists believe the key to solving those puzzles lies with the remains, and they say they are seeking permission to dig up the body to conduct carbon and DNA testing. \n\nIf the skull is undamaged, the scientists can go to the heart of a question that has fascinated scholars and the public for centuries: the identity of the \"Mona Lisa.\" Recreating a virtual and then physical reconstruction of Leonardo's face, they can compare it with the smiling face in the painting. \n\n\"We don't know what we'll find if the tomb is opened. We could even just find grains and dust,\" says Giorgio Gruppioni, an anthropologist who is participating in the project. \"But if the remains are well kept, they are a biological record of events in a person's life, and sometimes in their death.\" Silvano Vinceti, the leader of the group, said that _ in charge of the said burial site at Amboise Castle early next week. \n\nLeonardo moved to France at the invitation of King Francis I, who named him \"first painter to the king.\" He spent the last three years of his life there, and died in 1519 at age 67. The artist's original burial place, the palace church of Saint Florentine, was destroyed during the French Revolution and remains that are believed to be his were eventually reburied in the Saint-Hubert Chapel near the castle. \n\n\"The Amboise tomb is a symbolic tomb; it's a big question mark,\" said Alessandro Vezzosi, the director of a museum dedicated to Leonardo in his hometown of Vinci. Vezzosi said that investigating the tomb could help identify the artist's bones with certainty and solve other questions, such as the cause of his death. He said he asked to open the tomb in 2004 to study the remains, but the Amboise Castle turned him down. \n\nThe group of 100 experts involved in the project, called the National Committee for Historical and Artistic Heritage, was created in 2003 with the aim of \"solving the great mysteries of the past,\" said Vinceti, who has written books on art and literature. \n\nArguably the world's most famous painting, the \"Mona Lisa\" hangs in the Louvre in Paris, where it drew some 8.5 million visitors last year. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the painting's subject for centuries, with opinions ranging from the wife of a Florentine merchant to Leonardo's own mother. \n\nThat Leonardo intended the \"Mona Lisa\" as a self-portrait in disguise is a possibility that has interested and divided scholars. Theories have existed: Some think that Leonardo's taste for tricks and riddles might have led him to hide his own identity behind that puzzling smile; others have guessed that the painting hid an androgynous lover. \n\nIf granted access to the grave site, the Italian experts plan to use a tiny camera and radar to confirm the presence of bones. The scientists would then exhume the remains and attempt to date the bones with carbon testing. \n\nAt the heart of the proposed study is the effort to discover whether the remains are actually Leonardo's, including with DNA testing. \n\nVezzosi questions the DNA comparison, saying he is unaware of any direct descendants of Leonardo or of tombs that could be attributed with certainty to the artist's close relatives. \n\nGruppioni said that DNA from the bones could also eventually be compared to DNA found elsewhere. For example, Leonardo is thought to have rubbed colors on the canvas with his thumb, possibly using saliva , meaning DNA might be found on his paintings. \n\nEven in the absence of DNA testing, other tests could provide useful information, including whether the bones belonged to a man or a woman, and whether the person died young or old. \n\nEven within the committee, experts are divided over the identity of the \"Mona Lisa.\" \n\nVinceti believes that a tradition of considering the self-portrait to be not just a faithful imitation of one's features but a representation of one's spiritual identity may have resonated with Leonardo. \n\nVezzosi, the museum director, dismissed as \"baseless and senseless\" the idea that the \"Mona Lisa\" could be a self-portrait of Leonardo. He said most researchers believe the woman may have been either a wife of the artist's sponsor, the Florentine nobleman Giuliano de Medici, or Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The traditional view is that the name \"Mona Lisa\" comes from the silk merchant's wife, as well as its Italian name: \"La Gioconda.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Whose body do scientists want to dig up?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What testing do they want to do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "At what age did he die?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What happened to his original grave site?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "During which historical event?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was this original site?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where is he thought to be reburied?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Are they sure?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the world's most famous painting?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many people saw it last year?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is anyone certain who is depicted in the painting?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is one theory?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does Vezzosi think that the Mona Lisa is a self-portrait?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When did he first ask to study the remains?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Was he allowed?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What project was created in 2003?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "With how many experts involved?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What will carbon testing help scientists discover?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What tools do experts plan to use?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 6, "span_end": 388, "span_text": "The legend of Leonardo da Vinci is covered in mystery: How did he die?

After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off. Later that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it. Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away. She said to herself that it could not have done it. The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan. Nothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night. This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was. When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry. The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger. The dad got some glue and made the bunny's butt stuck on the carpet.

It was a very unconventional thing for her to do, no doubt; but Lady Hilda was certainly not the person to be deterred from doing anything she contemplated on the bare ground of its extreme unconventionally; and so far was she from objecting personally to her visit on this score, that before she rang the Berkeleys' bell she looked quietly at her little bijou watch, and said with a bland smile to the suspicious Mr. Jenkins, 'Let me see, Jenkins; it's one o'clock. I shall lunch with my friends here this morning; so you may take the carriage home now for my lady, and I shall cab it back, or come round by Metropolitan.' Jenkins was too much accustcmed to Lady Hilda's unaccountable vagaries to express any surprise at her wildest resolutions, even if she had proposed to go home on a costermonger's barrow; so he only touched his hat respectfully, in his marionette fashion, and drove away at once without further colloquy. \n\n'Is Mr. Berkeley at home?'

decisive and complete as the victory was on the part of the Greeks, produced, of course, a very profound sensation at Rome. Instead, however, of discouraging and disheartening the Roman senate and people, it only aroused them to fresh energy and determination. The victory was considered as wholly due to the extraordinary military energy and skill of Pyrrhus, and not to any superiority of the Greek troops over those of the Romans in courage, in discipline, or in efficiency in the field.

Now when I see the smiling faces of the kids I have helped, I deeply understand Lei Feng. Helping others makes me happy.\" Lei Feng (1940-1962) is one of the most famous soldiers in Chinese history. He lost his parents when he was very young. His neighbors brought him up. He died in an accident at 22. He did many good deeds in his short life. For example, he gave his own money to the parents of another soldier. And bought tickets for a woman he didn't know without telling her his name. On March 5, 1963, Chairman Mao called on people to \"Learn from Lei Feng\" and made the day \"Lei Feng Day\". Today almost 50 years has passed since Lei's death. Some people say that the spirit of Lei Feng is outdated . But many people think we need to promote that spirit again. There have been many reports about the coldness of people toward strangers. This has made many Chinese people think deeply about themselves. \"The most important thing is that we must be ready to help others and make it a habit.\" said Huang Tianze, a student from Jianlan High School in Zhejiang.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Zhang Kai?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did he do there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "with what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was special about March 5th?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he just learn this?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who was Lei Feng?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is he alive?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was he old?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "He was a nice person?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How do you know?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What did Chairman Mao do?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "HAs been a while since his death?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "how long?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What do people think of his spirit?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "and others?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 13, "span_end": 22, "span_text": "a student", "input_text": "a student", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 26, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power", "input_text": "North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 153, "span_text": "He has led a group of college student volunteers since last year", "input_text": "He has led a group of college student volunteers since last year", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 155, "span_end": 193, "span_text": "They help children at a primary school", "input_text": "They help children at a primary school", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 199, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "their studies and daily lives", "input_text": "their studies and daily lives", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 278, "span_end": 345, "span_text": "March 5 was a day for people to learn from Lei Feng and help others", "input_text": "It was a day for people to learn from Lei Feng and help others", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 350, "span_end": 407, "span_text": " I didn't know the real meaning of the spirit of Lei Feng", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 555, "span_end": 605, "span_text": "one of the most famous soldiers in Chinese history", "input_text": "one of the most famous soldiers in Chinese history", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 681, "span_end": 709, "span_text": "He died in an accident at 22", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 546, "span_end": 550, "span_text": "1962", "input_text": "1962", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 692, "span_end": 703, "span_text": "an accident", "input_text": "an accident", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 737, "span_end": 751, "span_text": "his short life", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 707, "span_end": 709, "span_text": "22", "input_text": "22", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 710, "span_end": 751, "span_text": " He did many good deeds in his short life", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 753, "span_end": 822, "span_text": "For example, he gave his own money to the parents of another soldier.", "input_text": "For example, he gave his own money to the parents of another soldier.", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 930, "span_end": 1003, "span_text": "called on people to \"Learn from Lei Feng\" and made the day \"Lei Feng Day\"", "input_text": "called on people to \"Learn from Lei Feng\" and made the day \"Lei Feng Day\"", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1011, "span_end": 1055, "span_text": "almost 50 years has passed since Lei's death", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1011, "span_end": 1026, "span_text": "almost 50 years", "input_text": "almost 50 years", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1057, "span_end": 1112, "span_text": "Some people say that the spirit of Lei Feng is outdated", "input_text": "Some people say that the spirit of Lei Feng is outdated", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1119, "span_end": 1173, "span_text": "many people think we need to promote that spirit again", "input_text": "many people think we need to promote that spirit again", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle4554.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "36pw28ko4zwsxpfeytqrzljzomiea1", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Zane Grey___The Spirit of the Border.txt/Chapter XX_51f9e87b12384e8fa2ac37d02e05222a5535a425c58d56349fe6c2e", "story": "Chapter XX. \n\nEarly on the following day Heckewelder, astride his horse, appeared at the door of Edwards' cabin. \n\n\"How is George?\" he inquired of Dave, when the latter had opened the door. \n\n\"He had a bad night, but is sleeping now.

Sometimes they have problems with their schoolwork, and sometimes with their friends. _ Some people think the worst thing is to do nothing. Laura Mills, a teenager from Washington, agrees. \"Problems and worries are normal in life,\" says Laura. \"But I think talking to someone helps a lot. If we don't talk to someone, we'll certainly feel worse.\" Laura once lost her purse, and worried for days. She was afraid to tell her parents shout it. She even walked three miles to school each day because she didn't have any money. She just kept thinking. \"If I tell my parents, they'll be angry!\" But in the end, she talked to her parents and they were really understanding. Her dad said he sometimes made careless mistakes himself. They got her a new purse and asked her to be more careful. \"I will always remember to share my problems in the future!\" Laura says. Robert Hunt advises students about common problems. He feels the same way as Laura. \"It is best not to avoid our problems.

The US standard for a DIN radio is 7\" x 2\" (although the actual 180 mm width converts to something like 7-3/32\" so most people use 7-1/8\" to allow for clearance) and the Double DIN sized radio is a 7\" x 4\". Some radios in Japanese Kei cars do not conform to the DIN standard however. \n\nFor removing the unit, a pair of U-shaped devices are often used. The devices are inserted in the two pairs of holes, at either end of the stereo fascia, the action releasing the unit from the mounting and providing a pair of handles to pull the unit free.

Her pony had jibbed on the way downhill, and the train was just on the point of moving off as she hurried upon the platform. Old Matthews, the stout and chubby-cheeked station-master, seized her most unceremoniously by the left arm, and bundled her into a carriage.

But Elma Clifford was a woman; and therefore she knew a more excellent way. HER habit was, rather to look things once fairly and squarely in the face, and then, with the unerring intuition of her sex, to make up her mind about them firmly, at once and for ever. That's one of the many glorious advantages of being born a woman. You don't need to learn in order to know. You know instinctively.

Like the planets, they go around the sun. But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \"snowball\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \"snowball,\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years.

Then he called personally. \n\n\"Carley, I've come to ask you to reconsider,\" he said, with a smile in his gray eyes. He was not a tall or handsome man, but he had what women called a nice strong face. \n\n\"Elbert, you embarrass me,\" she replied, trying to laugh it out. \"Indeed I feel honored, and I thank you. But I can't marry you.\" \n\n\"Why not?\" he asked, quietly. \n\n\"Because I don't love you,\" she replied. \n\n\"I did not expect you to,\" he said. \"I hoped in time you might come to care. I've known you a good many years, Carley. Forgive me if I tell you I see you are breaking--wearing yourself down. Maybe it is not a husband you need so much now, but you do need a home and children. You are wasting your life.\" \n\n\"All you say may be true, my friend,\" replied Carley, with a helpless little upflinging of hands. \"Yet it does not alter my feelings.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "who received a letter?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "from who?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "when?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "to where?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "during what month?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "was the it beginning of the month?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what part?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what was in the letter?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what kind?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what does he do for a living?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "was he young?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how is his age compared?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "is he wealthy?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "does he come from a good family?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what did Carley think about him?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did she want to marry him?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "how did she let him know?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "did he leave it at that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what did he do?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "how did that make her feel?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 96, "span_end": 118, "span_text": "she received by letter", "input_text": "Carley", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 108, "span_end": 171, "span_text": " by letter a formal proposal of marriage from Elbert Harrington", "input_text": "Elbert Harrington", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 73, "span_end": 118, "span_text": "Soon after her arrival she received by letter", "input_text": "Soon after her arrival", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 42, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "Carley returned to New York.", "input_text": "New York", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 13, "span_end": 41, "span_text": "The latter part of September", "input_text": "September", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 13, "span_end": 41, "span_text": "The latter part of September", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 13, "span_end": 41, "span_text": "The latter part of September", "input_text": "The latter", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 96, "span_end": 149, "span_text": "she received by letter a formal proposal of marriage ", "input_text": "a formal proposal", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 119, "span_end": 148, "span_text": "a formal proposal of marriage", "input_text": "of marriage", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 246, "span_end": 262, "span_text": "He was a lawyer ", "input_text": "a lawyer", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 278, "span_end": 292, "span_text": "somewhat older", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 278, "span_end": 317, "span_text": "somewhat older than most of her friends", "input_text": "somewhat older than most of her friends", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 323, "span_end": 337, "span_text": "a man of means", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 337, "span_end": 353, "span_text": " and fine family", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 446, "span_end": 487, "span_text": "she regarded as somewhat behind the times", "input_text": "as somewhat behind the times", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 524, "span_end": 551, "span_text": "But she could not marry him", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 553, "span_end": 612, "span_text": "and replied to his letter in as kindly a manner as possible", "input_text": "by replying to his letter", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 652, "span_end": 686, "span_text": "I've come to ask you to reconsider", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 652, "span_end": 686, "span_text": "I've come to ask you to reconsider", "input_text": "asked her to reconsider", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 824, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "you embarrass me", "input_text": "it embarrassed her", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "data/gutenberg/txt/Zane Grey___The Call of the Canyon.txt/CHAPTER IX_8b193c691b58fb592945dce94bb77cf6de34cab717263716f14909c"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3wz36bjev3gz5i23u2fiti3694ctb3", "filename": "high21407.txt", "story": "\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. \"It's so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress. \"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an injured sniff. \"We've got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth, contentedly.

He saw squirrels there running around looking for food. Third he went to the barn in the field. He saw a mommy cow. She was teaching her calf how to run.

Sometimes he used a lot of blue colours (his \"blue period\"). Later, he used more red and pink colours (his \"rose period\"). Many of his other paintings are called \"cubist \" because they are made of painted squares. After a long time, Picasso's paintings became more and more abstract. He painted people and things using strange shapes. His work was so original, many his fellow artists didn't understand it. Kindinsky, another famous artist, used lines, shapes, and patterns to paint his subjects. His paintings also used strong colours to express feelings. Other artists like the surrealists , they were interested in the subconscious . Painters like Breton and Magritte used many symbols in their work. The meaning or subject of their work wasn't always clear. Dai, another artist, painted pictures that looked like dreams. There are still many abstract artists around the world. It's often hard to say what their art is about. That's the way many artists like better.

All we can do is give her a strong will to live.\" \n\nHolding back her tears, Sue went to Joanna's room. Joanna lay with her face toward the window, eyes wide open. She was counting something backward. \"Twelve,\" she said, and a little later \"eleven\" until \"five,\" almost together. Sue looked out of the window. What was there to count? There was a wall covered with an old ivy vine growing half way up it. The cold breath of autumn has stricken the leaves from the vine until it was almost bare. \n\n\"Five what, dear?\" asked Sue. \n\n\"Leaves. On the ivy vine. When the last one falls I must go, too.\" \n\n\"Oh, Don't be silly.\" Said Sue, \"You will get better.\" \n\n\"There goes another one.

Don't try to move until I come back.\" \n\nOld Behrman was a poor painter who lived in the building. For years he had always been planning to paint a work of art, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Joanna and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf. \n\n\"What!\" Old Behrman was angered at such an idea. \"How silly!

Miller reviewed old documents from the initial investigation and saw that Guidroz's stories never seemed to add up. \n\nThere were \"several inconsistencies in Guidroz's account of the events from the day Wallace went missing,\" the release said. \n\nGuidroz resurfaced in Louisiana in March 2011 after reports that he had been charged in the killing of his wife, who is not the mother of Wallace.

It was clear that Tom Wheelock needed him, and he could, at least, look back a little, though this was an occupation to which he was not greatly addicted. He understood now how his father, who had perhaps never been a strong man, had slowly broken down under a load of debt that was too heavy for him, though the nature of the man who had with deliberate intent laid it on his shoulders was incomprehensible. Jimmy, in fact, could scarcely conceive the possibility of any man scheming and plotting to ruin a fellow-being for the value of two old schooners.

Mother bird told Robin how exciting it was to fly and see all the beautiful flowers and trees and told her she would help her learn like she did when she was a baby bird. She told her that she would meet lots of other bird friends, too. \n\nSo Robin tried not to be scared, even as she saw both of her brothers and sister fly off the nest and out into the world. They looked so happy. Then it was her turn. She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest. After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.

At first such institutions were created in the late 18th century in Bavaria and Strasbourg to serve children whose parents both worked out of the home. The term was coined by the German Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of educational institutions and learning spaces for children ranging from two to seven years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods. \n\nIn 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strasbourg an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day. At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in Bavaria.

Soon after this, most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire. \n\nUntil 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, ingathering of the exiles, and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and persecution that they experienced during their diaspora. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security. \n\nA religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state. A variety of Zionism, called cultural Zionism, founded and represented most prominently by Ahad Ha'am, fostered a secular vision of a Jewish \"spiritual center\" in Israel.

Windsurfing into the TARDIS \n\nThe plane that carried the Doctor and members of UNIT exploded, and the Doctor was sent flying out of it, about to crash to the ground. Was this how it would all end? \n\nInstead, the Doctor spotted the TARDIS and aimed himself to land right inside it. Wow! \n\nThe Master's AI interface assistant Seb was quite impressed by this, but the Master destroyed him as he squeed. \n\n3. Clara reunites with Danny \n\nAfter talking her way out of being killed by the Cybermen by impersonating the Doctor, Clara found herself in a graveyard, and discovered that an approaching Cyberman was her late boyfriend, Danny, who still had emotions, but was begging her to switch them off.

Their first big success was on Broadway in 1917. The Astaires -- as they were known --- became Broadway stars. However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing.

It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.\" In 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK] Fred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time.

As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry, infantry of the Norwegian Army. \n\nInfantry can enter and maneuver in terrain that is inaccessible to military vehicles and employ crew-served infantry weapons that provide greater and more sustained firepower. The transport and delivery techniques of modern infantrymen to engage in battle include marching, mechanised transport, aerial drop by parachute or by air assault from helicopter and amphibious landing from the sea. \n\nIn English, the 16th century term infantry (ca. 1570s) describes soldiers who walk to the battlefield, and there engage, fight, and defeat the enemy in direct combat, usually to take and occupy the terrain. As describing the branch of the combat arms, the term \"infantry\" derives from the French infanterie, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian fanteria and ultimately from the Latin infantera; the individual-soldier term infantryman (1837) was not coined until the 19th century.

The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology. \n\nThe Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era. In the ICS timescale, the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages, the Gelasian, Calabrian, Ionian and Tarantian. All of these stages were defined in southern Europe. In addition to this international subdivision, various regional subdivisions are often used. \n\nBefore a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences, the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present (BP), as opposed to the currently accepted 2.588 million years BP: publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period. \n\nCharles Lyell introduced the term \"pleistocene\" in 1839 to describe strata in Sicily that had at least 70% of their molluscan fauna still living today. This distinguished it from the older Pliocene Epoch, which Lyell had originally thought to be the youngest fossil rock layer. He constructed the name \"Pleistocene\" (\"Most New\" or \"Newest\") from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \"ple\u012bstos\", \"most\", and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, \"kain\u00f3s\" (latinized as \"c\u00e6nus\"), \"new\"; this contrasting with the immediately preceding Pliocene (\"More New\" or \"Newer\", from \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"ple\u00ed\u014dn\", \"more\", and \"kain\u00f3s\"; usual spelling: Pliocene), and the immediately subsequent Holocene (\"wholly new\" or \"entirely new\", from \u1f45\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \"h\u00f3los\", \"whole\", and \"kain\u00f3s\") epoch, which extends to the present time.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What time period is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is it more commonly called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How long ago did it start?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "And when did it end?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was the time before that called?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And the time period after?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many stages does the Pleistocene have?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is Ionian one of them?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "In what location did these names come from?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What organization decided on the time boundary between it and Pliocene?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When did they do that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When was the word first coined?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "By whom?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "To describe rock where?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does Pleistocene mean literally?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "And Pliocene?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "And Holocene?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Which epoch are we in how?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Have there been more glaciations since the Ice Age?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What are the names of the four stages?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 15, "span_text": "The Pleistocene", "input_text": "The Pleistocene.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 53, "span_end": 64, "span_text": "the Ice Age", "input_text": "The Ice Age.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 114, "span_end": 143, "span_text": "2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago", "input_text": "2,588,000 years ago.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 127, "span_end": 143, "span_text": "11,700 years ago", "input_text": "11,700 years ago.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 862, "span_end": 885, "span_text": "the preceding Pliocene ", "input_text": "The Pliocene.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1715, "span_end": 1724, "span_text": "Holocene ", "input_text": "Holocene.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 507, "span_end": 512, "span_text": "four ", "input_text": "Four .", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 553, "span_end": 560, "span_text": "Ionian ", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 611, "span_end": 628, "span_text": "southern Europe.

And another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said. But one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him.

Celina, who was standing near Joseph when he read the invitation, went out quickly to tell the others that the trick had worked. Everyone was pleased that Joseph thought that was true. But there was no camping trip. The whole thing was made up. At first, Celina thought it was fun. But later, when Joseph told her that he was going to buy a sleeping bag with his savings, Celina had a second idea. She knew that Joseph's family had little money, and she hated to see him spend his savings on something he would never use. Celina also hated to tell Joseph the truth.

The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). \n\nA tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly. \n\nThe problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \"hours\" of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time. As explained in the equation of time article, this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning that the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year), and the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit (the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic).", "questions": [{"input_text": "Solar time is based on what?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many kinds of it are there?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Can you name one of them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Please name one of them", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's another name for that one?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Please name the other kind of solar time?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Wjat's another name for that kind?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Does the sun take less time to get all the way around in September than in December?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many seconds more than 24 hours clock time can solar time be?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many less?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "This is because of what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Does that mean the Earth's orbit is a perfect circle?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does it mean?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is the Earh's axis perpendicular to the plane of its orbit?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is there another name for that?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "The shadow of a pole in sun points in how many possible directions?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Does it ever dissappear?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Does the author like sun dials?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 49, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "e based on the position of the Sun in the sky", "input_text": "the position of the Sun in the sky", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 143, "span_end": 165, "span_text": "Two types of solar tim", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 190, "span_text": "apparent solar time", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 190, "span_text": "apparent solar time", "input_text": "apparent solar time", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 192, "span_end": 204, "span_text": "sundial time", "input_text": "sundial time", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 226, "span_text": "mean solar time ", "input_text": "mean solar time", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 227, "span_end": 237, "span_text": "clock time", "input_text": "clock time", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 881, "span_end": 1064, "span_text": "The problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \"hours\" of solar time can be 21", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1077, "span_end": 1096, "span_text": " or 29 seconds more", "input_text": "up to 29 seconds", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1059, "span_end": 1078, "span_text": "be 21 seconds less ", "input_text": "up to 21 seconds less", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1171, "span_end": 1226, "span_text": " this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (", "input_text": "the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1228, "span_end": 1275, "span_text": "e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1288, "span_end": 1338, "span_text": " the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year", "input_text": "the distance between Earth and Sun varies throughout the year", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1359, "span_end": 1422, "span_text": "the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1438, "span_end": 1465, "span_text": "obliquity of the ecliptic).", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1438, "span_end": 1463, "span_text": "obliquity of the ecliptic", "input_text": "obliquity of the ecliptic", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 584, "span_end": 631, "span_text": "e Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc ", "input_text": "360", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 363, "span_end": 451, "span_text": " point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead)", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 454, "span_text": "when and if the Sun moves directly overhead).

But his songwriting skills -- some call him a rock and roll poet -- and his guitar work really set him apart. Early in his career he played mostly blues for black audiences in clubs in St. Louis, Missouri. But the most popular music in the area was country. So this musical scientist mixed country and blues. \n\nChuck Berry was born on October 18th, 1926, in St. Louis, where he still lives. His mother, Martha, was a high school principal. He was born the fourth of six children. He started singing in church when he was six years old. His interest in music stuck with him. \n\nA lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life, especially school. Chuck Berry and two friends were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car . He was released from prison four years later. But that would not be the last of his legal problems over the years. \n\nFilmmaker Taylor Hackford made a documentary called \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" named for a Chuck Berry song. It centered on the making of a concert to honor the musician on his sixtieth birthday in 1986. More than seventy-five artists and bands have done their own versions of Chuck Berry songs. Many have done several, including the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty and Bruce Springsteen. \n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, included Chuck Berry in its first year of honors in 1986.

The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer. \n\nIn general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species. According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what do pesticides do?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "is using them unusual?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "is it the same as plant protection?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "how many types are there?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "any negative effects?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what are the most dangerous kinds?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what do they protect plants from?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what are 2 targets?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what problems do microbes cause?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what class are pesticides?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what are some things that hurt plants?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "does pesticide always kill?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what else does it do?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what is another use for pesticide?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "esticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest", "input_text": "attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 316, "span_end": 436, "span_text": "This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 118, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "he most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 585, "span_end": 834, "span_text": " herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitiz", "input_text": "18", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1270, "span_end": 1294, "span_text": "some also have drawbacks", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1304, "span_end": 1351, "span_text": "potential toxicity to humans and other species.", "input_text": "potential toxicity to humans and other species.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1424, "span_end": 1514, "span_text": "9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides.", "input_text": "organochlorine pesticides.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1018, "span_end": 1025, "span_text": " pests.", "input_text": "pests.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1026, "span_end": 1075, "span_text": "Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens", "input_text": "insects and plant pathogens", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1144, "span_end": 1234, "span_text": "microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors.", "input_text": "destroy property", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 88, "span_end": 115, "span_text": "They are a class of biocide", "input_text": "biocide", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 261, "span_end": 314, "span_text": " damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects", "input_text": "weeds, fungi, or insects", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 958, "span_end": 992, "span_text": " that deters, incapacitates, kills", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 964, "span_end": 1024, "span_text": "deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests", "input_text": "deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 480, "span_end": 534, "span_text": "pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes", "input_text": "non-agricultural purposes", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "PesticidePesticide_22d75f4281afdda222c201c71761ebd480cf3805c8119cc6cf07ccff"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3oe22wjigio191jhdp2it3k7el4uqx", "filename": "cnn_f78a0688d47452613666b2dc1b3f1c9fc0910387.story", "story": "(CNN) -- The Rev.

If only he had even--say, a couple of thousands a year of his own--he might make a fight for it.

His Aunt Polly told him to paint the fence around the garden. It was ninety feet long and nine feet high. He felt very blue. Then he had a wonderful idea. He picked up his brush and started to work. Soon Ben came along the road. He was happily eating an apple. He stopped to look at Tom. Tom went on painting and pretended not to see Ben. \"I'm going swimming,\" said Ben. \"Do you want to go swimming, Tom? But I guess you can't. You have to stay and work, don't you?\" \"Work?\" Tom said. \"This isn't work. I'm enjoying myself. Does a boy get a chance to paint a fence like this every day?\" Ben thought about this. Tom continued painting carefully. Sometimes he stopped, stood back to look at the fence like an artist, and then added a bit more paint in just the right place. Ben was watching Tom paint with great interest. He was getting more and more eager to have a try himself. After a while, Ben asked Tom if he would let him paint a little. Tom thought about it, and said, \"No, Ben, I can't. You see. Aunt Polly wants it to be done well. Aunt Polly said that I must paint it with great care.\" \"Oh, please, Tom,\" begged Ben. \"I can do it. I'll be really careful. Just let me try. I'll give you half of my apple. Well, I'll give you all of it!\" \"Well, all right, Ben,\" said Tom. \"You must be very careful.\" He gave Ben his brush with worry on his face but joy in his heart. He sat down under the tree, and started to eat Ben's apple. All day, boys came to make fun of Tom, but they ended up staying to paint. When Ben got tired, Billy was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for a chance to paint. Then Johnny offered him a basketball, and so on. By late afternoon Tom had got all kinds of toys, and the fence had got three coats of paint.

Transylvania is part of modern-day Central European country Romania,and the country does indeed have a history of mythological vampires. \n\nHowever,Romanians are always puzzled by the description of the novel's central character, Count Dracula,a tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English. This is a world away from the images of vampires that they have grown up with. Romanian vampires are half-human creatures who live solitary lives in the forests,not aristocrats living in castles with well-stocked libraries. \n\nSo where did Stoke get the image for his Dracula? The answer becomes clearer when one learns of his relationship with a man called Henry Irving,the greatest British stage actor of his time. \n\nStoker was working as a civil servant in his home city of Dublin when he first met Irving. Bored with his tedious life and work, Stoker took every opportunity to visit the theatre and for a while was the drama critic for the Dublin Evening Mail. One of the reviews he wrote was of a performance of Shakespeare's play Hamlet,with Irving in the lead role. \n\nIrving was so pleased with Stoker's review of his performance that he asked to meet him. Stoker couldn't believe his luck when one night,he was invited to a dinner party where Irving was the guest of honour. Irving entertained the assembled dinner guests with some renditions of famous poems and speeches from Shakespeare. \n\nStoker was already writing the first chapters of Dracula and began to base the central character on Irving,in the vain hope that if it ever became a stage play, Irving would play the central character. Sadly,Irving never did,but the two men became close friends,and in 1878 Stoker left the civil service and became Irving's manager in London.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who wrote Dracula?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was it about?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where did it take place?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was it a typical vampire to others that were written about?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did Bram base the character off of someone he knew?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who was that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did they work together?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How did they become acquainted?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How did they start talking to each other?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where did they meet?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did they see each other after that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When was that?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 102, "span_end": 112, "span_text": "Bram Stoke", "input_text": "Bram Stoker", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 121, "span_end": 174, "span_text": "story of a vampire ,someone who lives on human blood.", "input_text": "story of a vampire ,someone who lives on human blood.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 272, "span_end": 284, "span_text": "Transylvania", "input_text": "Transylvania", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 697, "span_end": 792, "span_text": ",a tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English.", "input_text": "No, he wasa tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1019, "span_end": 1209, "span_text": "So where did Stoke get the image for his Dracula?

In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation \"gamma rays\". Rutherford had previously discovered two other types of radioactive decay, which he named alpha and beta rays. \n\nGamma rays are able to ionize atoms (ionizing radiation), and are thus biologically hazardous. The decay of an atomic nucleus from a high energy state to a lower energy state, a process called \"gamma decay\", produces gamma radiation. \n\nNatural sources of gamma rays on Earth are observed in the gamma decay of radionuclides and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin. Additionally, gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft.

TAPPITT IN HIS COUNTING-HOUSE. \n\nLuke Rowan, when he left the cottage, walked quickly back across the green towards Baslehurst. He had sauntered out slowly on his road from the brewery to Bragg's End, being in doubt as to what he would do when he reached his destination; but there was no longer room for doubt now; he had said that to Rachel's mother which made any further doubt impossible, and he was resolved that he would ask Rachel to be his wife. He had spoken to Mrs. Ray of his intention in that respect as though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be rejected, and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth; but he was eager, sanguine, and self-confident by nature, and though he was by no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom any young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved, he did not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with despair. He walked quickly home along the dusty road, picturing to himself a happy prosperous future in Baslehurst, with Rachel as his wife, and the Tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income paid to old Tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery. That was his present solution of the brewery difficulty. Tappitt was growing old, and it might be quite as well not only for himself, but for the cause of humanity in Devonshire, that he should pass the remainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement from business affords. He did not desire Tappitt for a partner any more than Tappitt desired him. Nevertheless he was determined to brew beer, and was anxious to do so if possible on the spot where his great-uncle Bungall had commenced operations in that line.

His bail was set at $5,750 (Canadian), said Neil MacKenzie, communications counsel with the province's criminal justice branch. \n\nOrders was instructed to turn over his passport and to not operate a hang glider or paraglider, he said. \n\nLenami Godinez-Avila had just started a tandem hang-gliding flight with the instructor, when she fell from the glider, plunging hundreds of feet to her death Saturday in a heavily wooded part of western Canada, authorities say. \n\nInvestigators say the instructor tried to hide what might be a key piece of evidence about what went wrong -- a possible onboard video recording of the flight -- in his digestive tract. \n\nThe recording has since passed and is now in police custody, MacKenzie said. He declined comment on whether anything retrievable could be taken from the card. \n\nCalls on Thursday and Friday seeking comment from Orders' attorney, Laird Cruickshank, were not immediately returned. \n\nThe fall happened near Mount Woodside, from which Orders and the 27-year-old Godinez-Avila took off, more than 50 miles east of Vancouver. \n\nA witness, Nicole McLearn, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that when the glider was in the air, Godinez-Avila appeared to be wearing her harness, but it wasn't attached to the glider.

Die-hard fans are still trying to work out the secrets behind many of the tricks he performed. \n\nBut Liu, 32, when asked, laughed off the idea that there might be an \"answer\" to his magic. \"The most fascinating things about magic is the puzzling process. People enjoy how magicians make the impossible come true,\" said Liu. \n\nFew people today believe in the possibility of real magic. They also often fail to consider magicians' devotion to their art. It can take a magician years' of practice to perfect a trick before he performs it on stage. \n\nPart of Liu's star appeal is his astonishing skill. However, when he began in the industry, he was embarrassingly clumsy. \"I could practice thousands of times for one single act. It wasn't much fun,\" he said. \n\nNo magician's supernatural powers on stage extend to their life off stage. Liu says his life was no easier or funnier because he was a magician. \n\nHe developed an interest in magic at a young age, but didn't consider making a living out of it until he graduated from university. He had studied Japanese language and found himself unable to find a job. \"My parents never considered being a magician as a proper job.

A SAD HOME-COMING \n\nMr. Lowrie and Auctherlonnie, the Dumfries bo'sun, both of whom would have died for the captain, assured me of the truth of MacMuir's story, and shook their heads gravely as to the probable outcome. The peculiar water-mark of greatness that is woven into some men is often enough to set their own community bitter against them. Sandie, the plodding peasant, finds it a hard matter to forgive Jamie, who is taken from the plough next to his, and ends in Parliament. The affair of Mungo Maxwell, altered to suit, had already made its way on more than one vessel to Scotland. For according to Lowrie, there was scarce a man or woman in Kirkcudbrightshire who did not know that John Paul was master of the John, and (in their hearts) that he would be master of more in days to come. Human nature is such that they resented it, and cried out aloud against his cruelty. \n\nOn the voyage I had many sober thoughts of my own to occupy me of the terrible fate, from which, by Divine inter position, I had been rescued; of the home I had left behind. I was all that remained to Mr. Carvel in the world, and I was sure that he had given me up for dead. How had he sustained the shock? I saw him heavily mounting the stairs upon Scipicks arm when first the news was brought to him. Next Grafton would come hurrying in from Kent to Marlboro Street, disavowing all knowledge of the messenger from New York, and intent only upon comforting his father.

Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. \n\nOne Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. \n\nThe article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \n\n\" We have so much. And these poor people now have nothing,\" I said.\"We'll share what we have with them.\" \n\nI brought three large boxes down from the room upstairs and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously, as the boys and I filled one of the boxes with canned goods and foods. \n\nWhile I sorted through our clothes, I encouraged the boys to go through their toys and donate some of their less favorite things. Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \n\n\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\" I said. \n\nThe boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest. She paused in front of the box that held the toys, pressed her round little face into Lucy's flat, painted-on-face, gave her a final kiss, then laid her gently on top of the other toys. \n\n\"Oh, Honey,\" I said.\"You don't have to give Lucy. You love her so much.\" \n\nMeghan nodded seriously, eyes glistening with held-back tears. '\"Lucy makes me happy, Mommy. Maybe she'll make that other little girl happy, too.\" \n\n_ , I stared at Meghan for a long moment, wondering how I could teach the boys the lesson she had just taught me. For I suddenly realized that anyone can give their cast-offs away. True generosity is giving that which you value most. \n\nHonest benevolence is a three-year-old offering a valuable, though shabby, doll to a little girl she doesn't know with the hope that it will bring this child as much pleasure as it brought her. I, who had wanted to teach, had been taught. \n\nThe boys had watched, open-mouthed, as their baby sister placed her favorite doll in the box. Without a word, Brad rose and went to his room. He came back carrying one of his favorite action figures. He hesitated briefly, clutching the toy, then looked over at Meghan and placed it in the box next to Lucy. \n\nA slow smile spread across Brett's face. Then he jumped up, eyes twinkling as he ran to fetch some of his prized Matchbox cars. \n\nAstonished, I realized that the boys had also recognized what little Meghan's gesture meant. Swallowing back tears, I pulled all three of them into my arms. \n\nTaking the cue from my little one, I removed my old jacket from the box of clothes. I replaced it with the new hunter green jacket that I had found on sale last week. I hoped the young woman in the picture would love it as much as I did. \n\nIt's easy to give that which we don't want any more, but harder to let go of things we cherish, isn't it?

She sat on thorns all breakfast time, devoured what her grandpapa called a sparrow's allowance, swallowed her tea scalding, and thereby gained nothing but leisure to fret at the deliberation with which Henrietta cut her bread into little square dice, and spread her butter on them as if each piece was to serve as a model for future generations. \n\nThe subject of conversation was not precisely calculated to soothe her spirits.

After Mr. Haswell had been carried to his room, some of the guests, among them Sir Robert Aylward, went to bed, remarking that they could do no good by sitting up, while others, more concerned, waited to hear the verdict of the doctor, who must drive from six miles away. He came, and half an hour later Barbara entered the billiard room and told Alan, who was sitting there smoking, that her uncle had recovered from his faint, and that the doctor, who was to stay all night, said that he was in no danger, only suffering from a heart attack brought on apparently by over-work or excitement. \n\nWhen Alan woke next morning the first thing that he heard through his open window was the sound of the doctor's departing dogcart. Then Jeekie appeared and told him that Mr. Haswell was all right again, but that all night he had shaken \"like one jelly.\" Alan asked what had been the matter with him, but Jeekie only shrugged his shoulders and said that he did not know--\"perhaps Yellow God touch him up.\" \n\nAt breakfast, as in her note she had said she would, Barbara appeared wearing a short skirt.

Over time, the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry (even if financial firms are not physically located there), or New York-based financial interests. \n\nAnchored by Wall Street, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, and the former American Stock Exchange. \n\nThere are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named \"de Waalstraat\" got its name. A generally accepted version is that the name of the street was derived from a wall (actually a wooden palisade) on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement, built to protect against Native Americans, pirates, and the British. A conflicting explanation is that Wall Street was named after \"Walloons\"\u2014 the Dutch name for a \"Walloon\" is \"Waal\".

In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. \n\nOne of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. \n\nAnd as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do.

The two had grown close when Tomaselli was the teen's summer camp counselor. \n\nSeven of those charges were dropped, Leary said, and Tomaselli pleaded guilty to gross sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact and two counts of visual sexual aggression towards a minor. \n\nTomaselli, 23, had told CNN earlier this month that he planned to plead guilty. \n\n\"I take complete responsibility for what I did,\" he said by phone from Lewiston, Maine. \n\nTomaselli, who is currently out on bail, is the third man to say publicly that Fine molested him.

Thomas Gordon was surprisingly well read and could floor Eric any time in argument, once he became sufficiently warmed up to attain fluency of words. Eric hardly recognized him the first time he saw him thus animated. His bent form straightened, his sunken eyes flashed, his face flushed, his voice rang like a trumpet, and he poured out a flood of eloquence which swept Eric's smart, up-to-date arguments away like straws in the rush of a mountain torrent. Eric enjoyed his own defeat enormously, but Thomas Gordon was ashamed of being thus drawn out of himself, and for a week afterwards confined his remarks to \"Yes\" and \"No,\" or, at the outside, to a brief statement that a change in the weather was brewing. \n\nJanet never talked on matters of church and state; such she plainly considered to be far beyond a woman's province.

And as it turned out, I love it! I love books about life and being a kid. And Alice in Laceis just that kind. It's a humorous book about being thirteen and the problems kids might face. Alice and her friends get a strange assignment from their totally cool teacher, Mr. Everett. It was like playing the game of \"Life,\" but you had to act it out. \n\nSo Pamela is pregnant, Elizabeth buys a car and Alice gets married. Well, of course, Pamela wasn't really pregnant, but she walked around with a pillow under her shirt to get people's reactions. Elizabeth didn't really buy a car, but she went to the car lot and made the sales guy think she was. The whole class got assignments like these! I would love to do something like that for school. \n\nIn the book Alice has a lot to think about. \"Getting married is hard!\" Alice says. She has to plan the ceremony, the honeymoon, find a place to live, pay for furniture and two months' rent and food. Maybe she and her \"husband\" could work it out -- if they were getting on fine! \n\nAlthough this book was funny, it really made me think about how problems like these could really mess up your life. Take teenage pregnancy for example. How could you have a baby and stay in school? You couldn't find a babysitter every day to stay with your kid. A child really consumes your life. I understand what the teacher was trying to do. He was trying to discourage the class from getting into these problems by giving them a glimpse of life. As someone about to become a teenager myself, I can say sometimes a story makes you think about what's up ahead. \n\nOverall, I would say this book is wonderful. My favorite part of the book is discovering that if I like it, there are seven other Alice books I can check out at my local library.

Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage. She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar. She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention. \n\nAfter two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.

Their parents had passed away long ago. Jim took care of Joy by himself. One day, Jim woke up at 3 in the morning as usual. When Joy was sleeping alone, Jim left their little house to deliver newspapers. As he did so, he found something unusual. One man was sitting in front of Jim's house. Jim was so surprised that he stopped to look at him closely. It was an icy morning and he looked very old. The poor old man didn't have anything to cover himself with. Jim went into his house to get the old man a blanket . However, there were no extra blankets, so Jim thought hard and took his father's coat. It was the only thing of his father's that he had left. Jim wrote a short note. \"Sir, I found you sleeping in front of my house. This is my father's coat. I hope it fits you well.\" He put the note in a pocket of the coat, and covered the old man with the coat. Then he went to work. When he came back three hours later, both the man and the coat were gone. Jim thought that it was the best thing he could have done with his father's coat. That afternoon, Jim hurried home after school because Joy was at home alone.

The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles for others to pick up. Each of the clothes had a tag that read, \"I am not lost. If you are caught in the cold, please take me to keep warm. \" According to Tara, the experience helped the children better understand the difficult situation of homeless people, who have to brave the cold winter on the streets. \"When we got back in the car after an hour on the street, they were all freezing cold and crying for the heater to be on because they were cold , \" she said. By next morning, all the jackets, gloves, and scarves on the poles were gone. Photos of the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook, and have got over10,000 likes. Tara, who did something similar in Toronto in December last year, says she's already planning next year's coat drive. She hopes that the meaningful thing can spread around the world, and she also wants to add $5 fast food gift card so that the homeless people can also enjoy a hot meal. \"We've got help from others

presidential election. \n\nDuvalier, wearing a dark suit and tie, greeted supporters at the busy Port-au-Prince airport.

He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier. \n\nThe younger Duvalier held onto power for 15 years before a revolt forced him to flee the country. Widely accused of corruption, Duvalier has been living in France. \n\nUpon arriving in Haiti, the former dictator and his wife went to the Karibe Hotel, according to Ryan Flaherty, head of security for Project Medishare.

According to Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, \"planned obsolescence\" is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry. \n\nThe New York Times cited Norman last month, saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically, both for hardware and software, so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version. \n\n\"This is an old-time trick- they're not inventing anything new,\" he said. \n\nThomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the \"planned obsolescence\" of companies, as recently reported by UK-based The Guardian. \n\nWensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because \"they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one\". \n\nBut the new psychology of consumers is part of this system, as Wensma said to the newspaper: \"We now want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing.\" \n\n_ \n\n\"It's to the damage of the consumer and the environment,\" as the New York Times quoted Norman. \"But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder.\" \n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, Apple's profit margin was more than 21 percent, reported the Los Angeles Times. At Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC manufacturer, it was only 7 percent. \n\n\"Steven Jobs pushed the principle of 'planned obsolescence' to new heights,\" the newspaper commented on the company's profits and marketing strategy. \"Apple's annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year's MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version, even when the changes are incremental.\" \n\nPeer pressure \n\nAs to Li Jijia, the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates. When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices, he worries about feeling left out. \n\n\"Some apps and games require better hardware to run,\" said Li. \"If you don't join in, you lose part of the connection to your friends.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the author of the book?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Name of the book?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What trick he talked about?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What culture it represents?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Of whom?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did anyone oppose the idea?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's his nationality?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "and profession?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who reported about him?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "From which country?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "going back - who reported about Norman?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What upgraded he talked about?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did it give wrong feeling to the customers?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "about what?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did Wensma think it's wasteful?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who did he blame?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What they released?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What timeline usually they target?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What Wensma thing is part of the system?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "To him what we now want?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 46, "span_end": 118, "span_text": "Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things", "input_text": "Donald Norman", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 80, "span_end": 118, "span_text": "the book The Design of Everyday Things", "input_text": "The Design of Everyday Things", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 119, "span_end": 155, "span_text": " \"planned obsolescence\" is the trick", "input_text": "\"planned obsolescence\"", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 163, "span_end": 226, "span_text": "the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry.", "input_text": "upgrading culture", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 167, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry. \n", "input_text": "today's consumer electronics industry.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 543, "span_end": 611, "span_text": "Thomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the \"planned obsolescence\"", "input_text": "Thomas Wensma", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 543, "span_end": 565, "span_text": "Thomas Wensma, a Dutch", "input_text": "Dutch", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 557, "span_end": 574, "span_text": " a Dutch designer", "input_text": "designer", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 629, "span_end": 672, "span_text": "recently reported by UK-based The Guardian.", "input_text": "The Guardian.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 650, "span_end": 673, "span_text": "UK-based The Guardian.

WORDSWORTH. \n\nHarry's last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see full justice done to Norman, and enjoying the scene for him. It was indeed a painful ordeal to Norman himself, who could, at the moment, scarcely feel pleasure in his restoration, excepting for the sake of his father, Harry, and his sisters. To find the head-master making apologies to him was positively painful and embarrassing, and his countenance would have been fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture.

Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, while the Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. In 2011, the city had a population of 4.5\u00a0million, while the population of the city and its suburbs was 14.1\u00a0million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area's economy have ranged from $60 to $150 billion (GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India, after Mumbai and Delhi. Kolkata ( is also known as Calcutta , the official name until 2001). \n\nIn the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi.

The lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance. Initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the FA was given an official coat of arms by the College of Arms; this introduced ten Tudor roses, one for each of the regional branches of the FA. Since 2003, England top their logo with a star to recognise their World Cup win in 1966; this was first embroidered onto the left sleeve of the home kit, and a year later was moved to its current position, first on the away shirt. \n\nAlthough England's first away kits were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against Germany in the semi-final of Euro 96 but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced.
