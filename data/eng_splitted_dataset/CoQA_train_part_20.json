Spielberg based his film on parts ofTeam of Rivals, a book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. He makes Abraham Lincoln relevant today by presenting a cunning political mind trying to overcome Washington's all too familiar political divisions. \n\nIn previous movies, Lincoln was shown as a simple yet almost perfect man. But Spielberg's Lincolnis different. \"I was determined to make a movie about a working president dealing with real problems. Not some angel,\" Spielberg said. \n\nWe watch the president first ending slavery and then the war. \n\nThe film's adviser, historian Eric Martin, explains how Lincoln's thinking evolved. \n\n\"His main objective when the war began was not the freeing of the slaves but to keep the country united. Lincoln realizes that in order to keep the country together, the question of slavery will have to be addressed,\" Martin said. \n\nThe film focuses on the last four months of his presidency. \n\nIn the movie, the arguments among political enemies seem very similar to the problems we see in Washington today. The disagreements were bitter. \n\nThe film turns to Lincoln's relationships with his wife and kids, his beliefs and constant self-examination. Daniel Day-Lewis, the actor who plays Lincoln, offers an Oscar-worthy performance as the 16th President. Not only is his physical similarity to the president incredible, he is able to capture many of Lincoln's mannerisms and his high-pitched, almost lady-like voice. \n\n\"I found it very easy to play the role of Lincoln because the real man himself was so open. When I was researching his history to prepare for the part, one of the most surprising things I found was just how accessible he was. Even in war-time, when he was in great danger, he was always willing to meet with others and share his ideas,\" Day-Lewis said. \n\nSpielberg's Lincolnwill head to the Oscars.

It also will clear the Ivory Coast's debt accumulated through the European Investment Bank. \n\nTop military brass pledged their support to Ouattara in a ceremony Tuesday at a hotel in Abdijan. Gen.

But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. \n\nZahra was reported missing October 9. But no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. \n\nElisa Baker was arrested on October 10, initially on several charged unrelated charges, including writing worthless checks.

Jack was born on May 18, 1975 in Hawaii. Being the son of a famous surfer, Jack naturally has an interest in surfing. Most of his life lessons were learned in the water. At the age of 17, Jack entered the finals of the Pineline Masters---the world's most famous surfing competition. Everyone thought Jack would become a professional surfer like his father. Unluckily, one month later, he had a deadly accident while surfing and was seriously hurt. Life is like a revolving door. When it closes, it also opens. Jack started to practice playing the guitar and write songs when he was staying in hospital. At first, his father thought Jack only did it for fun, but soon he was surprised at the great progress his son had made. When studying in the university, Jack didn't stop practicing his guitar skills. He played the guitar for school parties. He wrote songs and sang for his teachers and friends. They liked his songs. His first music album Brushfire Fairytalescame out in 2001. It was a great success. His second album,On and On, was much like his first one. They were filled with sweet, easy-going songs that everybody liked listening to. Later, Jack had lots of concerts in and out of America. He became popular all over the world. Jack had five albums by 2010 and more than 15 million copies of them were sold. His music doesn't fit into any of the popular music styles like pop, rock, R&B or hip-hop. It is more like fold music, played with a guitar and beautiful voice. When listening to his songs, you feel like lying on the beach enjoying the warm sunshine. Jack is a talent, though he himself says he is only a surfer who loves music. In his songs we can find his secret of success: Whatever happens in our lives, we have to accept it and do the best we can.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did Jack's dad do for a living?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did he surf also?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did he do it competitively?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What competition did he enter?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "At waht age?", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "What did he practice in college?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he play for others?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Were his pieces liked?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "By who?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is college where he first started playing?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Where did he start?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why was he there?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did he do anything else while there?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When was his first album released?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was its title?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What type of music does he play?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does he think of himself as?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is his secret?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Where is it found?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 390, "span_end": 427, "span_text": " a professional surfer like his fathe", "input_text": "professional surfer", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 148, "span_end": 189, "span_text": "Jack naturally has an interest in surfing", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 261, "span_end": 308, "span_text": "Jack entered the finals of the Pineline Masters", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 274, "span_end": 308, "span_text": "the finals of the Pineline Masters", "input_text": "the Pineline Masters", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 243, "span_end": 259, "span_text": "At the age of 17", "input_text": "17", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 797, "span_end": 875, "span_text": "When studying in the university, Jack didn't stop practicing his guitar skills", "input_text": "guitar", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 876, "span_end": 916, "span_text": " He played the guitar for school parties", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 972, "span_end": 992, "span_text": "They liked his songs", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 972, "span_end": 992, "span_text": "They liked his songs", "input_text": "his teachers and friends", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 643, "span_end": 674, "span_text": "when he was staying in hospital", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 642, "span_end": 674, "span_text": " when he was staying in hospital", "input_text": "in the hospital", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 458, "span_end": 482, "span_text": "he had a deadly accident", "input_text": "he had a accident", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 631, "span_end": 673, "span_text": "write songs when he was staying in hospita", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 631, "span_end": 642, "span_text": "write songs", "input_text": "he wrote songs", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 994, "span_end": 1052, "span_text": "His first music album Brushfire Fairytalescame out in 2001", "input_text": "2001", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 998, "span_end": 1036, "span_text": "first music album Brushfire Fairytales", "input_text": "Brushfire Fairytales", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1487, "span_end": 1507, "span_text": "more like fold music", "input_text": "fold music", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1665, "span_end": 1717, "span_text": " he himself says he is only a surfer who loves music", "input_text": "a surfer who loves music", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1798, "span_end": 1841, "span_text": "we have to accept it and do the best we can", "input_text": "accepting whatever happens and doing the best we can", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1718, "span_end": 1765, "span_text": " In his songs we can find his secret of success", "input_text": "In his songs", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle268.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3k772s5np8b77cns4z0jg76301veh2", "filename": "middle3183.txt", "story": "Betty and I are best friends.

The ritual began after breakfast when Dad always announced: \"Go ahead everyone. I'll take care of the dishes!\" With that my mother disappeared into the folds of the Sunday paper. Off came the suit coat he had worn to church that morning. Up went the shirtsleeves. On went that apron. For the next hour Dad did the dishes, singing ballads like \"I Had a Hat When I Came In\" and \"Who Put the Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?\" \n\nI suppose it was strange for a boy's father to wear an apron - even one with race cars - but I never thought much of it until the day that Dad broke with tradition. It was the last Sunday in August. My father seemed in an expansive mood as we walked home from church together. \n\n\"Tommy,\" he said letting my name roll off his tongue. My mind raced ahead of his words: The birds and the bees? A new bike? A part-time job? \n\n\"There comes a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities.\" This was important. I might even get to back the car out of the driveway. \n\n\"Responsibilities?\" I asked. \n\n\"Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household.\" Power tools? Boss my baby brother? \n\n\"Starting today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can work the crossword puzzle together.\" \n\n\"The dishes!?\" \n\n\"Anything wrong with taking over the dishes, son?\" \n\nI started to say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my protests would fall on deaf ears. \n\nI didn't taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the radio last night. \n\n\"Mickey Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall,\" he said. \"Just a straight line climb in right out of the stadium.\" He looked out the window as if trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey Mantle wearing an apron. \n\nSuddenly, everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced: \"Let's go read the paper, Hon.\" \n\n\"Aren't you doing the dishes?\" my mother asked in puzzlement. \n\n\"Your oldest son has generously offered to fill the position.\" \n\nMy brother and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to ride the roller coaster - backward. These things I would do. But I could never do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse. \n\nPeople often say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt - ready to relax. In his right hand was the old apron. \n\n\"I want you to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet.\" And before I could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. \"Thanks, Son. Your mother and I appreciate this.\" \n\nWith that he disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. The dark angel flew off. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. The words came out of nowhere.

Though the establishment was new it had already achieved its unwritten code of customs, and the sanctity of Herr von Kwarl's specially reserved table had acquired the authority of a tradition. A set of chessmen, a copy of the Kreuz Zeitung and the Times, and a slim- necked bottle of Rhenish wine, ice-cool from the cellar, were always to be found there early in the forenoon, and the honoured guest for whom these preparations were made usually arrived on the scene shortly after eleven o'clock. For an hour or so he would read and silently digest the contents of his two newspapers, and then at the first sign of flagging interest on his part, another of the cafe's regular customers would march across the floor, exchange a word or two on the affairs of the day, and be bidden with a wave of the hand into the opposite seat. A waiter would instantly place the chessboard with its marshalled ranks of combatants in the required position, and the contest would begin. \n\nHerr von Kwarl was a heavily built man of mature middle-age, of the blond North-German type, with a facial aspect that suggested stupidity and brutality. The stupidity of his mien masked an ability and shrewdness that was distinctly above the average, and the suggestion of brutality was belied by the fact that von Kwarl was as kind-hearted a man as one could meet with in a day's journey. Early in life, almost before he was in his teens, Fritz von Kwarl had made up his mind to accept the world as it was, and to that philosophical resolution, steadfastly adhered to, he attributed his excellent digestion and his unruffled happiness. Perhaps he confused cause and effect; the excellent digestion may have been responsible for at least some of the philosophical serenity.

It's a friend who wants to tell you his or her latest health problems. You hate to be impolite and cut your friend off, but what can you do? Stephanie Winston, author of Stephanie Winston's Best Organizing Tips, offers his advice: Don't ask questions like \"What's new?\" They give the information that you have time to talk. After \"hello\", get right to the heart of the matter. Time your calls wisely. If you make a call right before lunch or dinner, or at the end of the workday, people chat less. Set a time limit. Start with, \"Hi, I've only got a few minutes, but I wanted to talk to you about....\" Or, \"Gee, I'd love to talk more, but I only have a couple of minutes before I have to leave.\" Jump on a pause. Even the most talkative caller has to pause now and then. Quickly say, \"It has been great talking with you.\" Then end the conversation. Forget niceties. Some people just don't take a hint. Cut your caller off and say, \"I'd like to talk to you longer, but I'm afraid I have no enough time. Good bye.\" Then hang up. Find \"a partner in crime\". If nothing else works, ask someone in your home to help you. For example, one woman gives a sign to her husband, who shouts, \"Jane, I think the roast chicken is burning.\" Avoid the phone completely. Use an answering machine to screen calls. If you have an important message for a chatterbox, leave the message when he or she isn't in.", "questions": [{"input_text": "at what times of day do people chat less?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what other time?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what should you use to screen calls?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who called in the story?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "did they want to talk about sports?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what did they want to talk about?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is Stephanie's profession?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what did she write?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how should you go about setting a time limit for calls?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what do even the most talkative callers have to do every now and again?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how should you hurry them off the phone?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what if they don't get the hint?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "and then just hang up?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "can a partner help you with calls?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "should you use an elaborate system with hand signals?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "who yelled about chicken?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "whose husband?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what is another way to avoid phone calls?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "can you avoid the phone completely?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what rang at the beginning of the story?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 470, "span_end": 496, "span_text": "at the end of the workday,", "input_text": "at the end of the workday,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 443, "span_end": 455, "span_text": "before lunch", "input_text": "before lunch", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1273, "span_end": 1293, "span_text": "an answering machine", "input_text": "an answering machine", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 22, "span_end": 31, "span_text": "a friend ", "input_text": "a friend", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 64, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "latest health problems", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 60, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "her latest health problems", "input_text": "her latest health problems", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 177, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "author ", "input_text": "author", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 187, "span_end": 227, "span_text": "Stephanie Winston's Best Organizing Tips", "input_text": "Stephanie Winston's Best Organizing Tips", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 533, "span_end": 577, "span_text": "Start with, \"Hi, I've only got a few minutes", "input_text": "Start with, \"Hi, I've only got a few minutes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 767, "span_end": 773, "span_text": "pause ", "input_text": "pause", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 787, "span_end": 837, "span_text": "Quickly say, \"It has been great talking with you.\"", "input_text": "Quickly say, \"It has been great talking with you.\"", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 865, "span_end": 880, "span_text": "Forget niceties", "input_text": "Forget niceties", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1029, "span_end": 1042, "span_text": "Then hang up.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1043, "span_end": 1068, "span_text": "Find \"a partner in crime\"", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1154, "span_end": 1167, "span_text": "gives a sign ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1169, "span_end": 1181, "span_text": " her husband", "input_text": "her husband", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1196, "span_end": 1200, "span_text": "Jane", "input_text": "Jane", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1362, "span_end": 1403, "span_text": "leave the message when he or she isn't in", "input_text": "leave the message when he or she isn't in", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1241, "span_end": 1267, "span_text": "Avoid the phone completely", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 9, "span_text": "The phone", "input_text": "The phone", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle2796.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3uj1cz6izhpw128f4sjfgr7sxvrs53", "filename": "Hong_Kong.txt", "story": "Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory south to Mainland China and east to Macao in East Asia.

Last week, she and Miranda Lambert sang this song at the Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, and Meghan kicks off a headlining North American tour next February in Vancouver, Canada.

Drawing inspiration from elements of punk rock while departing from its musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations, post-punk music was marked by varied, experimentalist sensibilities and its \"conceptual assault\" on rock tradition. Artists embraced electronic music, black dance styles and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory, cinema, performance art and modernist literature. Accompanying these musical developments were subcultures that produced visual art, multimedia performances, independent record labels and fanzines in conjunction with the music. \n\nThe term \"post-punk\" was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas. Many of these artists, initially inspired by punk's DIY ethic and energy, ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement, feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody. They repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity, instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition, subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences. Artists moved beyonds punk's focus on the concerns of a largely white, male, working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes, such as three-chord progressions and Chuck Berry-based guitar riffs. These artists instead defined punk as \"an imperative to constant change\", believing that \"radical content demands radical form\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was the term \"post punk\" first used?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who first used it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What type of music is it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is it classical or jazz?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What genre is it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where did the inspiration come from?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was it conventional?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was it marked by?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was seen during this movement?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did the artist's embrace?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What kind of subcultures developed?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 918, "span_end": 930, "span_text": " late 1970s ", "input_text": "late 1970s", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 892, "span_end": 912, "span_text": "used by journalists ", "input_text": "journalists", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 933, "span_end": 1005, "span_text": "describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas", "input_text": "describe groups beyond punk's sonic template", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 15, "span_end": 47, "span_text": "heterogeneous type of rock music", "input_text": "heterogeneous", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 347, "span_end": 423, "span_text": ".

Three elements, together with the legacy of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian language, and Kosovo Myth. When the Principality of Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining the national identity, instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs (Croats and Bosniaks).

Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The boys were terrified and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control. Tim knew that it would soon be swallowed by the waves. \"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls. \"I'm trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\" Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to shout to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\" \"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said. Once they were in the water, Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces. \"Are we almost there?\" they asked again and again. \"Yes,\" Tim told them each time.

He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact, but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van. \"I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch.\" At the bottom, rocks cut a fuel tank, which caught fire. A tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire. Steve dashed to Ronnie, who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had used his pocket knife to cut himself free from the driver's side seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to free him. He tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150 gallon fuel tanks exploded. Both Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts on both of his legs. Steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns, and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke a tooth. In February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver. Steve insists Ronnie is the real hero: \"If he hadn't gone into the ditch, he would have hit that van. It was his decision to drive off the road.\" \"I feel pretty good about it,\" says Ronnie. \"A lot of people could have been hurt.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "what cut the fuel tank?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "did the truck explode?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who had been driving?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what time of day was it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "was it dawn or was it dusk?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who was in the back of the van?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "did Ronnie want to crush them?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "who found Ronnie?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what state were they going through?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what broke the windshield?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how old is Ronnie?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "did his legs catch on fire?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who pulled Ronnie from the fire?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "how long was he in the hospital?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "did he need surgery?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what did Steve lose?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "where had Ronnie driven into?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "who received an award?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who did they think the real hero was?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "was he happy about the ultimate outcome?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 760, "span_end": 765, "span_text": "rocks", "input_text": "rocks", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1474, "span_end": 1504, "span_text": "150 gallon fuel tanks exploded", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1288, "span_end": 1294, "span_text": "Ronnie", "input_text": "Ronnie", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 7, "span_end": 16, "span_text": "near dusk", "input_text": "near dusk", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 494, "span_end": 502, "span_text": "children", "input_text": "children there were kids inside", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 664, "span_end": 743, "span_text": "I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch.", "input_text": "I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch./ no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 22, "span_end": 55, "span_text": "Kim Cooper and her husband, Steve", "input_text": "Kim Cooper and her husband, Steve", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 78, "span_end": 96, "span_text": " northern Kentucky", "input_text": "northern Kentucky", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 802, "span_end": 815, "span_text": "A tree branch", "input_text": "A tree branch", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 271, "span_end": 273, "span_text": "38", "input_text": "38", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 873, "span_end": 960, "span_text": "He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire", "input_text": "He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire/ yes", "turn_id": 12, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1168, "span_end": 1173, "span_text": "Steve", "input_text": "Steve", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1593, "span_end": 1603, "span_text": "two months", "input_text": "two months", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1611, "span_end": 1644, "span_text": "hospital and received skin grafts", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1762, "span_end": 1769, "span_text": "a tooth", "input_text": "a tooth", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1962, "span_end": 1967, "span_text": "ditch", "input_text": "a ditch", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1784, "span_end": 1795, "span_text": "the Coopers", "input_text": "the Coopers", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1909, "span_end": 1915, "span_text": "Ronnie", "input_text": "Ronnie", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 2044, "span_end": 2069, "span_text": "feel pretty good about it", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high23985.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3dhe4r9ocwb1c0g1r9n0t6ldoz6g2j", "filename": "cnn_4ab712d16cbee8f2eae1d61efc77a93c036d4c6c.story", "story": "(EW.com) -- Rebel Wilson will emcee the 2013 MTV Movie Awards, the network announced Thursday in a \"first look\" trailer that aired during the \"Jersey Shore\" finale. \n\nSet to air on April 14, this is the \"Pitch Perfect\" star's first time hosting, and the first time a woman has hosted since Sarah Silverman's stint in 2007. \n\nOn top of the delightful news that Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are hosting the Golden Globes this year, we're hoping the female comedian-as-host trend continues. \n\nTake a look at the trailer, featuring Wilson herself, here. \n\nAfter her over-the-top roles in \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Pitch Perfect,\" we can't wait to see her signature comedy style on the annual awards show. \n\nIn the show's 20 year history, the hosts have been inconsistent.

However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South. Usually, the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States. The region is known for its culture and history, having developed its own customs, musical styles, and cuisines, which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States.

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany.

The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his creation on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city. \n\nChokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them. \n\nThe app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes.

Still, the flight was considered a success. \n\nThen, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. \n\nProfessor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded.

Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled \"The Book\" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. \n\nThe oil painting titled \"The Book\" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. \n\nA different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. \n\nThe painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. \n\nThe 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. \n\nThe painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. \n\nThe painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns.

Also in 2016, Edmonton had a metropolitan population of 1,321,426, making it the sixth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is North America's northernmost city with a metropolitan population over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an \"Edmontonian\". \n\nEdmonton's historic growth has been facilitated through the absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) and a series of annexations ending in 1982.

It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China. These findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier. On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year. The report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents. \"Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever.\" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America. \"We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.\" Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy-two thousand students. Why do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. \"The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students. Foreign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education. And from Learning English, that's the VOA Special English Education Report.

Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford, but Harold defeated and killed him at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement. \n\nAlthough William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the leader?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did he have a nickname?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was his dad?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did he have a dad-like figure?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When did Ed die?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did the leader fight with one of Ed's  relatives?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How was he related?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When did they fight?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was the leader totally safe on his seat of power?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How did he get things in order?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did he greatly increase the number of slaves?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What became the most exclusive type of speech?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did the form of the governing party become a lot different?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 136, "span_end": 171, "span_text": " led by Duke William II of Normandy", "input_text": "Duke William II of Normandy", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 173, "span_end": 210, "span_text": "later styled as William the Conqueror", "input_text": "William the Conqueror", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 269, "span_end": 333, "span_text": "familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward", "input_text": "he had a familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 403, "span_end": 433, "span_text": ".

Traditional heroes are no longer sought after anymore. Today, it's unconventional leading figure -like Francis J.

And it has caught the attention of real politicians, including US President Barack Obama. \n\nKevin Spacey plays Francis J. Underwood, a cold-blooded Democrat who moves his way up the political ladder by any means necessary. He often uses his under-exposure in media to carry out misdeeds that will later benefit him. \n\nThe revenge theme plays a heavy role throughout the storyline, Underwood, who had high hopes for an appointment as Secretary of State in the first season, was betrayed by the US President and his former colleagues. He and his wife then conducted a plan of revenge and swore to unseat those who turned their backs against him. Through their plan, Underwood's own hunger for power grew and empowered him to get rid of whoever stood in his Way. \n\nThe release of the trailer of the second season excited millions of viewers around the world, including US President Barack Obama, who has been a loyal fan since the series debuted. Obama expressed his admiration for Underwood. \"This guy's getting a lot of stuff done,\" he said. Although the President is anxious to watch the story unfold, he'd like to do it at his own pace. After the release of the second season on February 14, 2014, Obama sent words on his Twitter account, \"Tomorrow: @HouseOfCards. No spoilers , please.\" \n\nThe second season has promised to be darker, with more unexpected turnouts, and is to include more Chinese elements. \"Perhaps the team, including myself, has realized that in the next decade, Asia will be an extensively important region, and China will play an active role in its transition and change,\" says Spacey.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What kind of characteristics are in this plot?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What party does the main character belong to?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is a common undertone in this show?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Anybody famous view this show?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who is it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does he have contempt for the main character?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who is the main character?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is he warm and fuzzy?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How long has this show been on?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "On what social media site has this show been mentioned?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 100, "span_end": 135, "span_text": "Chinese elements in its storyline.

And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. \n\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' \n\nMary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses. \n\nSee all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes \n\n\"Dynasty\" \n\nOkay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers.

There was a latent unwillingness in Mrs. Egremont's mind to discuss the subject with either aunt or daughter; and when the post brought no letter, Ursula, after a moment's sense of flatness, was relieved, and returned to her eager desire to hurry after the water-soldier. It was feasible that very afternoon. Mary Nugent came in with the intelligence. \n\n'And can Gerard come? or we shall only look at it.' \n\n'Yes, Gerard can come, and so will Mr. Dutton,' said Mary, who, standing about half-way between Mrs. Egremont and her daughter, did not think herself quite a sufficient chaperon. \n\n'He will look on like a hen at her ducklings,' said Nuttie. 'It is cruel to take him, poor man!' \n\n'Meantime, Nuttie, do you like an hour of \"Marie Stuart?\"' \n\n'Oh, thank you!' But she whispered, 'Aunt Ursel, may I tell her?' \n\n'Ask your mother, my dear.' \n\nLeave was given, half reluctantly, and with a prohibition against mentioning the subject to any one else, but both mother and aunt had confidence in Mary Nugent's wisdom and discretion, so the two friends sat on the wall together, and Ursula poured out her heart.

Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: spacetime, physical energies and forces, dark matter, and so on. Thus the term \"physicalism\" is preferred over \"materialism\" by some, while others use the terms as if they are synonymous. \n\nMaterialism belongs to the class of monist ontology.

Rick Santorum -- a favorite of social conservatives whose first pressing problem is convincing people he has a shot at powerhouse Team Obama. \n\nAnd the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain, a conservative radio host.

Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while a few others were under some rule by the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century. In the 19th century, it was colonized as Portuguese Guinea. Upon independence, declared in 1973 and recognised in 1974, the name of its capital, Bissau, was added to the country's name to prevent confusion with Guinea (formerly French Guinea). Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability since independence, and no elected president has successfully served a full five-year term. \n\nOnly 14% of the population speaks Portuguese, established as the official language in the colonial period. Almost half the population (44%) speaks Crioulo, a Portuguese-based creole language, and the remainder speak a variety of native African languages.

The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a centre of commerce between China and other parts of the world (predominantly Western countries), and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined.

He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \"coffee headache\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache.

was a global war that began as a conflict between Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies, which declared independence as the United States of America. \n\nAfter 1765, growing philosophical and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Following the Stamp Act, Patriot protests against taxation without representation escalated into boycotts, which culminated in the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts colony. Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power. \n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at Concord in April 1775 led to open combat. Militia forces then besieged Boston, forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army. Concurrently, an American attempt to invade Quebec and raise rebellion against the British decisively failed. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its declaration on July\u00a04. Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive, capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at Trenton and Princeton restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an invasion from Quebec under John Burgoyne, intending to isolate New England. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate campaign against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at Saratoga in October 1777.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Did someone try to take away someone else's arms?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did someone try to take away someone else's arms?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was trying to do the taking?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "From whom?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When was this?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did the militants do after that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who then became a commander?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Of what force?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who was in charge of a Britain retaliation?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did he gain anything?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was this overall grand conflict called?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did it have an alternate name?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What dates was it fought?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who was it between?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What legislative action was the catalyst?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What was ruined in water?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who did that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Where at?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1042, "span_text": "British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1043, "span_text": "British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1042, "span_text": "British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia", "input_text": "the British", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1043, "span_text": "British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia ", "input_text": "the Massachusetts militia", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1067, "span_text": "British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at Concord in April 1775", "input_text": "April 1775", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1088, "span_end": 1123, "span_text": "Militia forces then besieged Boston", "input_text": "besieged Boston", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1173, "span_end": 1241, "span_text": "Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army", "input_text": "George Washington", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1173, "span_end": 1241, "span_text": "Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army", "input_text": "the Continental Army", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1454, "span_end": 1507, "span_text": "Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive", "input_text": "Sir William Howe", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1454, "span_end": 1532, "span_text": "Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive, capturing New York City", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1454, "span_end": 1532, "span_text": "Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive, capturing New York City", "input_text": "New York City", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also known as the American War of Independence, was a global war that began as a conflict between Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies", "input_text": "The American Revolutionary War", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 43, "span_end": 89, "span_text": "also known as the American War of Independence", "input_text": "the American War of Independence", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "The American Revolutionary War (17751783),", "input_text": "1775-1783", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 122, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "a conflict between Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies", "input_text": "Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 371, "span_end": 452, "span_text": "Following the Stamp Act, Patriot protests against taxation without representation", "input_text": "the Stamp Act", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 498, "span_end": 563, "span_text": "the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor", "input_text": "a shipment of tea", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 484, "span_end": 563, "span_text": "culminated in the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor", "input_text": "the Sons of Liberty", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 484, "span_end": 563, "span_text": "culminated in the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor", "input_text": "in Boston Harbor", "turn_id": 19}], "name": "American_Revolutionary_War.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3a1cohj8njvqybd1rwejoxahp6m8h2", "filename": "mc500.train.40", "story": "David bought a new house and wanted to start a garden in his backyard.

Spielberg based his film on parts ofTeam of Rivals, a book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. He makes Abraham Lincoln relevant today by presenting a cunning political mind trying to overcome Washington's all too familiar political divisions. \n\nIn previous movies, Lincoln was shown as a simple yet almost perfect man. But Spielberg's Lincolnis different. \"I was determined to make a movie about a working president dealing with real problems. Not some angel,\" Spielberg said. \n\nWe watch the president first ending slavery and then the war. \n\nThe film's adviser, historian Eric Martin, explains how Lincoln's thinking evolved. \n\n\"His main objective when the war began was not the freeing of the slaves but to keep the country united. Lincoln realizes that in order to keep the country together, the question of slavery will have to be addressed,\" Martin said. \n\nThe film focuses on the last four months of his presidency. \n\nIn the movie, the arguments among political enemies seem very similar to the problems we see in Washington today. The disagreements were bitter. \n\nThe film turns to Lincoln's relationships with his wife and kids, his beliefs and constant self-examination. Daniel Day-Lewis, the actor who plays Lincoln, offers an Oscar-worthy performance as the 16th President. Not only is his physical similarity to the president incredible, he is able to capture many of Lincoln's mannerisms and his high-pitched, almost lady-like voice. \n\n\"I found it very easy to play the role of Lincoln because the real man himself was so open. When I was researching his history to prepare for the part, one of the most surprising things I found was just how accessible he was. Even in war-time, when he was in great danger, he was always willing to meet with others and share his ideas,\" Day-Lewis said. \n\nSpielberg's Lincolnwill head to the Oscars.

Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission. \n\nThe Northwest Territories, a portion of the old North-West Territory, entered the Canadian Confederation on July 15, 1870, but the current borders were formed on April 1, 1999, when the territory was subdivided to create Nunavut to the east, via the \"Nunavut Act\" and the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\".

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Alsace was united with the other Alemanni east of the Rhine into the stem duchy of Swabia.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the region a part of?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "WHat was known as Stadtrepublk?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What happened to it in January 1793?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "when?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who had control over it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "at the same time?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "then how?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "of what?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "6 times?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how many?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "in how long?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What happened during the decline of the roman empire?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What type of people lived there?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What happened to their language?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who were Lothar's brothers?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How was his realm divided?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What was given to his son?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 33, "span_text": "The region, as part of Lorraine, ", "input_text": "Lorraine,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 180, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse", "input_text": "The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 239, "span_end": 334, "span_text": "Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798", "input_text": "became a part of Alsace", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 293, "span_end": 334, "span_text": " a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798", "input_text": "a vote", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 288, "span_end": 334, "span_text": "after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798", "input_text": "its citizens", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 319, "span_end": 333, "span_text": " 4 January 179", "input_text": "4 January 179", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 606, "span_end": 707, "span_text": "France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years.

Supporters say that makes the road safer for everyone, including pedestrians, by slowing down cars and taking bikes off the sidewalk. But some longtime residents disagree. Lois Carswell is president of a group called Seniors for Safety. She says the two-way bike lane is dangerous to older residents who are used to one-way traffic. \n\nLois: We wanted a lane -- the right kind of lane that would keep everybody safe, that would keep the bikers safe.

Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken. \n\nMcAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week. \n\nMcAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democrats -- his own party -- consider him \"honest and trustworthy.\" \n\nBut Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli's favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably. \n\nEnter Robert Sarvis. \n\nAs public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll. \n\nThat's not nearly enough to win in November -- with just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits \"we have to get a lot higher\" -- but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli.

I think I want to live without money because I hate it. I HATE MONEY.\" We were all touched by Maria's words as they reminded us of the spiritual burdens that money managing can bring to us. After class I offered to help Maria deal with her financial problems. She hesitated to accept my offer, and I could see from the expression on her face that she was afraid of what it might involve. I quickly promised her that I wouldn't make her do more than she was able to. I told her frankly that I didn't enjoy managing my money any more than she did hers and wouldn't burden her with guilt, judgments, or impossible tasks. All I would ask her to do was to let me help her look at her fears and try to make some sense of them. \n\nMaria still resisted my offer, and I can remember the excuses she gave me as they were the repeated complaints I had heard from so many people. \"I'11 never understand money,\" she said. \"My facts are meaningless.\" \"I don't deserve to have money.\" \"I never have enough,\" \"I have too little to manage.\" \"My financial position isn't worth looking at.\" and the most _ one of all, \"I just can't do it.\" \n\nGoing home that day, I couldn't get Maria out of my mind: Her attitude conveyed the same negativity and fear that I believed annoyed many people. I was sure it was this attitude that prevented people from managing their money effectively.

She also worked to bolster her own appeal with racial minorities by pointing out Tillis' enactment of a strict voter identification law. \n\nNeither candidate has enjoyed much popularity in the state according to an NBC News/Marist poll from last week showing Hagan's disapproval rating at 48 percent and Tillis' at 44 percent.

These facts are not in dispute.\" \n\nThe comments, through the intermediary, break a silence from the offensive lineman who walked out after an incident in the team's cafeteria and hasn't been back since, according to Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin. \n\nDays later, Miami suspended Richie Incognito, 30, for conduct detrimental to the team. Rumors and news stories flew quickly in the days to come, including a well-publicized voice mail in which Incognito reportedly calls Martin a racial epithet and threatens his life. \n\nRichie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future \n\nSome also questioned the toughness of Martin, a Stanford University graduate who was in his second NFL season, especially as it came out that he might be seeking help for emotional issues. \n\nBut Cornwell stressed: \"Jonathan Martin's toughness is not an issue.\" \n\n\"Jonathan started every game with the Miami Dolphins since he was drafted in 2012,\" he said of the second-round draft pick. \"At Stanford, he was the anchor for Jim Harbaugh's 'smash mouth' brand of football and he protected (then-Stanford, now Indianapolis Colts quarterback) Andrew Luck's blind side.

Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. \n\nBillie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. \n\nDuring her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. \n\nShe co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. \n\nHer early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. \n\nHer voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly voice was soon to become very famous and influential. \n\nShe was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. \n\nIn early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off. \n\nOn May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life. She experienced many violent relationships. She also became increasingly dependent on various drugs which contributed to her early death in 1959, aged just 44.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How old was Billie Holliday when she passed away?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 3538, "span_end": 3542, "span_text": "1959", "input_text": "1959", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "high19314.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "336kav9kyqs1yr11lf9606shu602yu", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Stratemeyer___Dave Porter and His Rivals.txt/CHAPTER XV_62e8f7764c12ff2607b9edb5ca913eeb1e2c2d8e915df4592fb8716", "story": "CHAPTER XV \n\nA RUNAWAY MOTOR-BOAT \n\n\"What do you make of that?\" \n\n\"The motor-boat must have run away from Nat!\" \n\n\"Either that or Nat has fallen overboard!\" \n\n\"Maybe Nat has been drowned!\" \n\nThese and other remarks were made, as the boys on the highway gazed down at the craft that was speeding along in such an erratic fashion over the surface of the river.

San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \"Summertime Blues\", from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including \"Born to Be Wild\", which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider (1969). Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound. \n\nFrom outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974\u201375 (Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Mot\u00f6rhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.", "questions": [{"input_text": "how many Groups that emerged ?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what did blue cheer release ?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "of what ?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "whats is the name ?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "was in in 1970 ?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is the year ?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is the ablum name ?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what did he release in the same month ?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who released it ?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what movie was it in ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "in 1970 ?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "in what year ?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what was 17 mins long ?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "in what year ?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what did it prefigured ?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "how many alubums did the Canadian trio Rush put out ?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who gain international attention from 1976 ?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what was released in 1979 ?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who abandoned blues ?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "when did lizzy form ?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 85, "span_end": 164, "span_text": "Iron Butterfly, MC5, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.

In the week's hard work during the preparation for sea at Portsmouth, he had learned as much of the names of the ropes, and the various parts of the ship, as he would have done in a couple of months at sea, and had become acquainted with his new ship-mates. So great had been the pressure of work, that he had escaped much of the practical joking to which a new-comer on board ship, as at school, is generally subject. \n\nHe had for comrades four midshipmen; one of these, Simmons, had already nearly served his time, and was looking forward to the war as giving him a sure promotion; two others, Delafield and Hawtry, had already served for two or three years at sea, although only a year or so older than Jack, while the fourth, Herbert Coveney, was a year younger, and was, like Jack, a new hand. There were also in the berth two master's mates, young men of from twenty to two-and-twenty. With all of these Jack, with his high spirits, good-tempered face, merry laugh, soon became a favorite. \n\nDuring the first two days at sea he had suffered the usual agonies from sea-sickness.

A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills. \n\nThe Vietnam War is often regarded as a low point for the U.S. Army due to the use of drafted personnel, the unpopularity of the war with the American public, and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by American political leaders. While American forces had been stationed in the Republic of Vietnam since 1959, in intelligence & advising/training roles, they did not deploy in large numbers until 1965, after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. American forces effectively established and maintained control of the \"traditional\" battlefield, however they struggled to counter the guerrilla hit and run tactics of the communist Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army.

Diaz is a \"cable racer\", and every morning he faces the difficult task of taking the local teacher to her school. To do this, he first walks for an hour up to a place the locals call Los Pinos, right at the edge of the 400-foot deep gorge of the Negro valley. Here, one end of a thick metal cable has been fixed to a wooden post. The cable stretches right across the deep valley to the other side, a kilometer away. \n\nA metal hook is fixed to the cable, with leather straps hanging from it. Diaz fastens the straps around his shoulders and waist, does a quick safety check and then, without hesitating, throws himself off the edge of the mountain. Attached to the cable by only the metal hook, he rapidly picks up speed and soon he is racing through the air. Crossing the valley by wire takes him 30 seconds, instead of the two hours it would take him to walk down through the rain forest and climb up the steep muddy slopes on the other side. \n\nAs Diaz begins his trip, Diana Rios, a 23-year-old elementary teacher, is waiting on the other side of the gorge for the moment when he will come racing through the mist towards her at 100 mph. She will then return with him, hanging on to him as he goes back along the cable. Diana had no idea when she took the teaching job that just getting to work in the village school would be dangerous. \"At first I wanted to cry,\" she says, clutching her hook as the metal cable starts to rattle violently at Diaz's approach. \"But I soon got used to it.\" She still prefers to go with Diaz, though, rather than making the frightening and dangerous crossing on her own. \n\nFor the inhabitants of Los Pinos, the wire cable is a lifeline. For more than 50 years, it has served the community as a form of transport to and from the rest of the world. Everything that comes arrives via the cable----bricks and wood for building, sacks of rice and corn. Pregnant mothers, who must get to the nearest clinic, cross the wire during the darkness of the night, returning with their newborn babies. It is dangerous, but they have no choice. \n\nThis time Robinson Diaz makes a perfect landing on Diana's side of the gorge. For him, the dangers of this daily journey are insignificant. \"What I'm really scared of are snakes,\" he says. \"This is nothing in comparison.\" Then Dianna straps herself into her harness and hooks herself up to the wire behind Diaz, holding on to him tightly. He turns, flashes her a smile, releases the brake and kicks away.

She volunteered as part of a project which was set up in 2009 to help homeowners in South Land Park pick oranges and other fruits out of their backyards. Before, the fruit would rot on the ground or get eaten by animals. Now the fruit is donated to those who need it. \"It is good for many people\", said Randy Stannard, who works for the project. \"The homeowner gets fruit picked and more people can have healthy food.\" \"Two harvests ( ) were organized in 2009 and volunteers picked 3,000 pounds (1,360kg) of fruit\", Stannard said. In 2010, the number was 20,000. This year, Soil Born Farms hopes to get 40,000 pounds. They will harvest every weekend from January to April. Shannon Galloway, Christopher's science teacher, brought her students into the project this year. \"You're making use of a _ that might be wasted,\" she said. \"I think it's meaningful to everyone.\" Donato Frazier, 15, always climbs up a ladder and gets on the top of the tree. \"Standing on the treetop is pretty cool,\" Frazier said. \"I can see clearly that many baskets are filled up, and even see that many people are eating healthy fruit because of our volunteer work.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Did Kelly pick apples?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Has she done it before?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where did students volunteer?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many volunteered?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many pounds were harvested in 2009?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What about 2010?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Will they harvest in September this year?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When will they?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Does Donato get on top of a house?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What can he see from there?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are they trying to harvest 30,000 pounds this year?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How many pounds are they thinking of?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How did the students learn about the project?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does Donato think the treetop is frightening?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does he think about it?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who gets the fruit after it is harvested?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What school do the students attend?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where is that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What happens to fruit on the ground?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is Shannon Galloway?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 105, "span_end": 159, "span_text": " she used a pole to pick oranges off trees and collect", "input_text": "she used a pole to pick oranges off trees and collect", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 177, "span_end": 242, "span_text": "It's the first time in her 15 years she's picked fruit from trees", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 416, "span_end": 458, "span_text": "30 student volunteers at Soil Born Farms.

looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. \n\nThe painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. \n\nIn a separate story,

She owned and published The Washington Post. Under her leadership, it became one of the most important newspapers in the country. \n\nKatharine Meyer was born in New York City in 1917. Her father was a successful investment banker and became an important financial official. Her family was very rich. Katharine grew up in large houses in New York and Washington. Her parents were often away from home, traveling and working, Katharine was often lonely. Katherine Meyer graduated from the University of Chicago in Illinois in 1938. In 1933, her father bought a failing newspaper, The Washington Post. It was the least successful one of five newspapers in Washington. \n\nKatharine Graham returned to Washington and got a job editing letters to the editor of her father's newspaper. She married Philip Graham. He was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter but soon accepted a job at his wife's father's newspaper. Mr. Graham improved The Washington Post. He bought Newsweek and several television stations. He also established close ties with important political leaders. However, Mr. Graham treated his wife badly. He had an affair with a young reporter. For many years, Mr. Graham suffered from mental illness. He killed himself in 1963. \n\nKatharine Graham had four children to raise and a newspaper to operate. At first, she was only concerned about finding a way to keep control of The Washington Post until her sons were old enough. She did not think she had the ability to do an important job. She had no training in business or experience in operating a large company. In those days, it was unusual for a woman to be the head of a business. Women were expected to look after their homes and children. \n\nKatharine Graham met with officials of The Washington Post. She was elected president of The Washington Post Company.

These rumours had been abroad since May, and, if not arising out of, they were certainly stimulated by, an edict published by Valentinois concerning the papal chamberlain, Francesco Troche.

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. \n\nIn 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". \n\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did heavy metal develop?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it sometimes just called metal?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where did it originate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What are the lyrics associated with?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "anything else?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In 1968, what was a popular band?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "And who else?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did they perform for small groups?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did Judas Priest move away from, which genre?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did Motorhead add?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did it change the tempo, too?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "At the end of the 70's what were the fans called?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "or?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Which group became popular in  the 80s?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "and?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who is a thrash metal band?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 104, "span_text": "Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s,", "input_text": "in the late 1960s and early 1970s,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 29, "span_text": "Heavy metal (or simply metal)", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 104, "span_end": 135, "span_text": " largely in the United Kingdom.", "input_text": "in the United Kingdom.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 364, "span_end": 459, "span_text": "Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo", "input_text": "aggression", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 446, "span_end": 459, "span_text": " and machismo", "input_text": "and machismo", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 520, "span_text": "In 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin", "input_text": "Led Zeppelin", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 577, "span_text": "In 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences", "input_text": "Black Sabbath", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 536, "span_end": 577, "span_text": "and Deep Purple attracted large audiences", "input_text": "Deep Purple", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 551, "span_end": 578, "span_text": " attracted large audiences,", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 645, "span_end": 733, "span_text": "udas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence;", "input_text": "its blues influence;", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 734, "span_end": 778, "span_text": "Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility", "input_text": "punk rock sensibility", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 780, "span_end": 815, "span_text": "nd an increasing emphasis on speed.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 978, "span_end": 1023, "span_text": "heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\"", "input_text": "metalheads", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1023, "span_end": 1042, "span_text": " or \"headbangers\".

Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. \n\nPete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. \n\nProfessor Walker: \"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. \n\nProfessor Walker: \"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\" \n\nProfessor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. \n\nDavid Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. \n\nTo build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas about straw houses continue, including stories about the threat of fire. Mr. Lanfear says straw bale houses have done well when tested for fire resistance. And he says his builders use the same building methods as traditional builders to keep out rain. \n\nDavid Lanfear: \"We use what we call good shoes and a good hat, and that would be a solid foundation and a really good roof.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Pete Walker?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "At what school?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did he make?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "With what materials?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did he work alone?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who helped?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are they planning to study the house?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What about it?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Is straw expensive?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Does it damage the environment?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who owns Bale on Bale Construction?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How did he feel about building with straw at first?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Has he accepted the building material?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many houses has he used it in?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Are they a fire hazard?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What kind of frame does the house have?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What are the straw walls coated with?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Does Walker feel these houses make the cost of operating a home less?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 356, "span_end": 368, "span_text": " a professor", "input_text": "a professor", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 376, "span_end": 394, "span_text": "University of Bath", "input_text": "University of Bath", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 398, "span_end": 405, "span_text": "Britain", "input_text": "Britain", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 453, "span_end": 460, "span_text": "a house", "input_text": "a house", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 473, "span_end": 503, "span_text": "straw bales and hemp material.", "input_text": "straw bales and hemp material.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 406, "span_end": 436, "span_text": " He and a team of researchers ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 414, "span_end": 435, "span_text": "a team of researchers", "input_text": "a team of researchers", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 504, "span_end": 591, "span_text": "During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 554, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "the effectiveness of these materials", "input_text": "the effectiveness of these materials", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 520, "span_end": 533, "span_text": "twelve months", "input_text": "twelve months", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 719, "span_end": 768, "span_text": " it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 899, "span_end": 966, "span_text": "So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment.

So, in 1915, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allies in World War I because the western allies promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria-Hungary) for participation that was more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality.

It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3\u00a0million. \n\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area.

He explained that he must be paid whether he won or lost the case. \"Whatever you decide,\" he declared to the judges, \" I must be paid. For if you decide in my fovor , then I win the case, and so I must be paid . But If you decide against me, then Evalthus has won his first case in the court; according to our agreement, he must pay his lessons. Therefore I shall get my money whatever happens.\" \n\nThe Athenian judges found no fault in it, so they asked Evalthus to reply. \n\n\"No, it's quite clear,\" said Evalthus, \" that I need not pay.

The crop was heavy and because the barn was small it had been their business during the afternoon to spread and trample down the grass Jake flung up to them. They had been working at high pressure at one task or another since soon after daylight that morning, and now the confined space was very hot, though the sun was low. Its slanting rays smote the cedar shingles above their bent heads, and the dust that rose from the grass floated about them in a cloud and clung to their dripping faces. Frank felt that the veins on his forehead were swollen when they paused a moment for breath, leaning on their forks. \n\n\"I suppose we could get a couple more loads in, and there can't be more than that,\" said Harry dubiously. \"I wouldn't mind a great deal if the next jumperful upset.\" \n\nFrank devoutly wished it would, for he felt that he must get out into the open air, but a few moments later they heard the plodding oxen's feet and the groaning of the clumsy sled. The sounds ceased abruptly and Jake's voice reached them. \n\n\"Tramp it down good!\" he called. \"You've got to squeeze in this lot and another.\" \n\nFrank choked down the answer which rose to his lips. But the hay must be got in, and the boys fell with their forks upon the first of the crackling grass Jake flung up to them.

Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. \n\nThe planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.",

It was co-founded in 1935 by Sir Allen Lane, his brothers Richard and John, as a line of the publishers The Bodley Head, only becoming a separate company the following year. Penguin revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks, sold through Woolworths and other high street stores for sixpence, bringing high-quality paperback fiction and non-fiction to the mass market. Penguin's success demonstrated that large audiences existed for serious books. Penguin also had a significant impact on public debate in Britain, through its books on British culture, politics, the arts, and science. \n\nPenguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House, an emerging conglomerate which was formed in 2013 by the merger of the two publishers. Formerly, Penguin Group was wholly owned by Pearson PLC, the global media company which also owned the \"Financial Times\", but it now retains only a minority holding of 47% of the stock against Random House owner Bertelsmann which controls the majority stake. It is one of the largest English-language publishers, formerly known as the \"Big Six\", now the \"Big Five\". \n\nThe first Penguin paperbacks were published in 1935, but at first only as an imprint of The Bodley Head (of Vigo Street) with the books originally distributed from the crypt of Holy Trinity Church Marylebone. Only paperback editions were published until the \"King Penguin\" series debuted in 1939, and latterly the \"Pelican History of Art\" was undertaken: these were unsuitable as paperbacks because of the length and copious illustrations on art paper so cloth bindings were chosen instead.

August 11th, Neipperg, provoked by the grievous news just come from Breslau, pushes suddenly forward on Schweidnitz, by way of consolation; Schweidnitz, not so strong as it might be made, where the Prussians have a principal Magazine: \"One might at least seize that?\" thinks Neipperg, in his vexed humor. But here too Friedrich was beforehand with him; broke out, rapidly enough, to Reichenbach, westward, which bars the Neipperg road to Schweidnitz: upon which,--or even before which (on rumor of it coming, which was not YET true),--Neipperg, half done with his first day's march, called halt; prudently turned back, and hastened, Baumgarten way, to his strong Camp at Frankenstein again. His hope in the Schweidnitz direction had lasted only a few hours; a hope springing on the mere spur of pique, soon recognizable by him as futile; and now anxieties for self-preservation had succeeded it on Neipperg's part. For now Friedrich actually advances on him, in a menacing manner, hardly hoping Neipperg will fight; but determined to have done with the Neisse business, in spite of strong camps and cunctations, if it be possible. [Orlich, i. 137, 138.] \n\nIt was August 16th, when Friedrich stirred out of Strehlen; August 21st, when he encamped at Reichenbach. Till September 7th, he kept manoeuvring upon Neipperg, who counter-manoeuvred with vigilance, good judgment, and would not come to action: September 7th, Friedrich, weary of these hagglings, dashed off for Neisse itself, hoped to be across Neisse River, and be between Neisse Town and Neipperg, before Neipperg could get up. There would then be no method of preventing the Siege of Neisse, except by a Battle: so Friedrich had hoped; but Neipperg again proved vigilant.

A bombed-out building remains as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of Gadhafi's daughters, along with a statue of a Libyan fist crushing an American jet. \n\nAnd Tuesday evening, after rebel fighters who have battled Gadhafi's forces for six months punched into the compound, it was wreathed in smoke. Rebels posed around the statue and fired hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air in celebration, spurring the occasional rebuke from senior fighters. \n\nThe rebels picked through the compound in search of Libya's longtime strongman, but one fighter told CNN that neither Gadhafi nor any members of his family had been found.

Still, the official independent review deals a heavy blow to those who love college football and idolize Paterno. \n\nPenn State trustee Kenneth Frazier, head of the committee addressing the Sandusky scandal, said it was clear that Paterno and other key university leaders exhibited \"inexcusable failures\" when it came to protecting children. \n\nBut, Frazier said, figuring the coach's legacy will be a bit more complicated. \n\nPaterno defended Penn State in letter before his death \n\n\"There is a lot about his life that's worth emulating,\" he said. \"You have to measure every human by the good they've done, the bad they've done. I don't think any of us wants to be measured by the worst things we've ever been done in our life.\" \n\nFollowing the report's release Thursday, many people took to social media to condemn the aura of support that has long surrounded Paterno -- and the students who rioted in November after he was fired.

Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly a billion). \n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, with 70 percent of Chinese speakers and a huge area stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast. This is attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas. \n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four tones. The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final glottal stop. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain retroflex initial consonants, which have been lost in southern dialect groups. \n\nThe capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century. In the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan and one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is used as one of the working languages of the United Nations.

I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \n\n\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free. \n\n\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there.

Her French maid, Josephine, used to come in at seven, and wash and dress her quietly, for if there were any noise Aunt Barbara would knock and be displeased. Aunt Barbara rose long before that time, but she feared lest Aunt Jane should be disturbed in her morning's sleep; and Kate thought she had the ears of a dragon for the least sound of voice or laugh. \n\nAt half-past seven, Kate met Mrs. Lacy in the school-room, read the Psalms and Second Lesson, and learnt some answers to questions on the Catechism, to be repeated to Lady Barbara on a Sunday. For so far from playing at cards in a bird-of-paradise turban all Sunday, the aunts were quite as particular about these things as Mr. Wardour-- more inconveniently so, the countess thought; for he always let her answer his examinations out of her own head, and never gave her answers to learn by heart; \"Answers that I know before quite well,\" said Kate, \"only not made tiresome with fine words.\" \n\n\"That is not a right way of talking, Lady Caergwent,\" gravely said Mrs. Lacy; and Kate gave herself an ill-tempered wriggle, and felt cross and rebellious. \n\nIt was a trial; but if Kate had taken it humbly, she would have found that even the stiff hard words and set phrases gave accuracy to her ideas; and the learning of the texts quoted would have been clear gain, if she had been in a meeker spirit.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. \n\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "how is it defined?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what must it do to work correctly?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "are they also called something else?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "is the worm helpful?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "do pathogens change?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "slowly?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "how are brains protected?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "are they solid?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what are they composed of?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 17, "span_text": "The immune system", "input_text": "The immune system", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 59, "span_text": "The immune system is a system of many biological structures", "input_text": "system of many biological structures", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 124, "span_end": 199, "span_text": "To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents", "input_text": "detect a wide variety of agents", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 193, "span_end": 219, "span_text": "agents, known as pathogens", "input_text": "pathogens", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 146, "span_end": 252, "span_text": "an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 702, "span_end": 730, "span_text": "Pathogens can rapidly evolve", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 702, "span_end": 740, "span_text": "Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 504, "span_end": 700, "span_text": "In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.

It was developed by ISO Technical Committee 37, Subcommittee 2, and first published on May 15, 2008. It is part of the ISO 639 series of standards. \n\nISO 639-5 defines \"alpha-3\" (3-letter) codes, called \"collective codes,\" that identify language families and groups. As of August 29, 2008 update to ISO 639-5, the standard defined 114 collective codes. The United States Library of Congress maintains the list of Alpha-3 codes that comprise ISO 639-5. \n\nThe standard does not cover all language families used by linguists. The languages covered by a group code need not be linguistically related, but may have a geographic relation, or category relation (such as \"Creoles\"). \n\nSome of the codes in ISO 639-5 codes are also found in the ISO 639-2 \"Alpha-3 code\" standard. ISO 639-2 contains codes for some individual languages, some ISO 639 macrolanguage codes, and some collective codes; any code found in ISO 639-2 is also found in either ISO 639-3 or ISO 639-5. \n\nLanguages, families, or group codes in ISO 639-2 can be of type \"group\" (\"g\") or \"remainder group\" (\"r\"). A \"group\" consists of several related languages; a \"remainder group\" is a group of several related languages from which some specific languages have been excluded. However, in ISO 639-5, the \"remainder groups\" do \"not\" exclude any languages.

Recent cases included the tragic case of a 15-year-old girl whose family moved from Ireland. She hanged herself in Massachusetts following months of bullying. Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her. Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers. \n\nJudy Kuczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA. Her daughter Tina was also the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota. She said,\"Our daughter was a very outgoing child. She was involved in all kinds of things and had lots of friends. And over a period of time her grades fell completely. She started having health issues. She couldn't sleep. She wasn't eating. She had terrible stomach pains and didn't want to go to school.\" \n\nBullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence, or it can be verbal--for example, insults or threats. Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying. \n\nAnd now there is cyber-bullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages. It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time. \n\nThe first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s. The latest government study in the United States was released last year. It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school. \n\nSusan Swearer is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network. She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need.

Richard Nixon. Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew. He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment, and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office. Before his appointment to the vice presidency, Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader. \n\nAs President, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, marking a move toward d\u00e9tente in the Cold War.

Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure. One of his most controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President. In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination.

We already know that National Security Agency can dip into your Facebook page and Google searches. And it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and ZIP code as part of any deal. \n\nSo when Edward Snowden -- now cooling his heels in Russia -- revealed the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans, collecting data on phone calls we make, it's not as if we should have been surprised. We live in a world that George Orwell predicted in 1984. And that realization has caused sales of the 1949, dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000% increase at one point on Amazon. com. \n\nComparisons between Orwell's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the everywhere-present Big Brother and today are, in fact, quite similar. Here are a few of the most obvious ones. \n\nTelescreens -- in the novel, nearly all public and private places have large TV screens that broadcast government propaganda , news and approved entertainment. But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens, private lives. Today websites like Facebook track our likes and dislikes, and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know. Then there are the ever-present monitoring cameras that spy on the ordinary people as they go about their daily routine. \n\nThe endless war -- In Orwell's book, there's global war that has been going on seemingly forever, and as the book's hero, Winston Smith, realizes the enemy keeps changing. One week we're at war with Eastasia and friends with Eurasia. The next week, it's just the opposite. There seems little to distinguish the two opponents, and they are used primarily to keep the people of Oceania, where Smith lives, in a constant state of fear, thereby making disagreement unthinkable -- or punishable. Today we have the so-called war on terror, with no end in sight, a generalized societal fear, suspensionof certain civil liberties, and an ill-defined enemy who could be anywhere, and anything. \n\nNewspeak -- the fictional, stripped-down English language, used to limit free thought. OMG (Oh my God), RU (Are you) serious? That's so FUBAR (Fucked Beyond Ail Recognition). LMAO (Laugh My Ass Off). \n\nMemory hole -- this is the machine used in the book to change or disappear embarrassing documents. Paper shredders had been invented, but were hardly used when Orwell wrote his book, and the concept of wiping out a hard drive was years in the future. But the memory hole foretold both technologies. \n\nSo what's it all meant? In 1984, Winston Smith, after an intense round of \"behavioral modification\" -- read: torture-- learns to love Big Brother, and the difficult world he was born into. Jump forward to today, it seems we've willingly given up all sorts of freedoms, and much of our right to privacy. Fears of terrorism have a lot to do with this, but dizzying advances in technology, and the ubiquity of social media, play a big part. \n\nThere are those who say that if you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of. But the fact is, when a government agency can monitor everyone's phone calls, we have all become suspects. This is one of the most frightening aspects of our modem society. _ Unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin, totally off the grid, there is simply no way the government won't have information about you stored away somewhere. \n\nWhat this means, unfortunately, is that we are all Winston Smith. And Big Brother is the modem surveillance state.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who is in Russia?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is Orwell a writer?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what type of a novel is it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what do stores want?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "who can see your face book?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "can telescreens spy?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is memory hole?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what is an example?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what technology did the hole talk about?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what is used to limit free thinking?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what is it called?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "is there a way for you to stop the government from getting your info?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who is the books hero?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "where does he live?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what does he realize?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "who are they at war with?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what is Big Brother?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What do people fear?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Were Paper shredders there when Orwell wrote the book?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "who hacks into our computers?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 361, "span_end": 376, "span_text": " Edward Snowden", "input_text": "Edward Snowden", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 776, "span_end": 811, "span_text": "Comparisons between Orwell's novel ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 669, "span_end": 685, "span_text": " dystopian novel", "input_text": "dystopian novel", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 300, "span_end": 330, "span_text": "home phone number and ZIP code", "input_text": "home phone number and ZIP code", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 151, "span_end": 176, "span_text": " National Security Agency", "input_text": "National Security Agency", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1144, "span_end": 1216, "span_text": "But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens, private lives.

You never run out of things to say when it comes to talking about the different types of people you work with, what you love, what you hate and how you deal with it all. \n\nWe thought we'd do a little research into some of the best co-workers out there. Not just the different personality types, but real people, who do real good things. \n\nWhat we found found is that many workers out there are generous, kind people who put their colleagues' lives before their own without hesitation. \n\nHere are 5 of the most heroic co-workers people encountered this year. \n\nThe heroes \n\n1. Co-worker helps to save a fellow employee's life \n\nClaude Marlowe, a diabetic, went to work one morning like any other day. When he went to shake a colleague's hand, he had a heart attack and dropped dead -- literally. \n\nThat's when Debi Coffman and another co-worker, Larry Garrett, realized that this wasn't a diabetic episode; Marlowe had no pulse. The two performed CPR and chest compressions and revived Marlowe three times before emergency crews arrived. He suffered five heart attacks and was brain dead for at least two hours. He would not be alive had his co-workers not known what to do. (Nascar.com) \n\n2. Chandler worker helps colleague get new artificial leg \n\nFor 30 years, Gregory Lewis, a retail maintenance worker, walked with the same prosthetic device on his left leg. As the years wore on, so did his artificial leg. One day, he lifted his foot off the ground to get into his car, and the artificial leg fell off.

We've found the right place for you, a school near Salisbury in England.\" \n\nHis heart filled with a terrible fear, all Bertie could think of was his white lion. \"But the lion,\" he cried, \"What about the lion?\" \n\n\"I'm afraid there's something else I have to tell you,\" his father said. Looking across at Bertie's mother, he took a deep breath. Then he told Bertie he had met a circus owner from France, who was over in Africa looking for lions to buy. He would come to their farm in a few days. \n\n\"No! You can't send him to a circus!\" said Bertie. \"People will come to see him. He'll be shut up behind bars. I promised him he never would be. And _ will laugh at him. He'd rather die. Any animal would! \" But as he looked across the table at them, he knew their minds were quite made up. \n\nBertie felt completely betrayed. He waited until he heard his father's deep breathing next door. With his white lion at his heels, he crept downstairs in his pyjamas, took down his father's rifle from the rack and stepped out into the night. He ran and ran till his legs could run no more. As the sun came up over the grassland, he climbed to the top of a hill and sat down, his arms round the lion's neck. The time had come. \n\n\"Be wild now,\" he whispered. \"You've got to be wild. Don't ever come home. All my life I'll think of you. I promise I will.\" He buried his head in the lion's neck. Then, Bertie clambered down the hill and walked away. \n\nWhen he looked back, the lion was still sitting there watching him; but then he stood up, yawned, stretched, and sprang down after him.

He taught Tom how to sing, dance, act, and tell jokes. When he felt Tom was ready to perform on stage, he made up ads. To stir up great interest, he said that Tom was eleven years old and had come from England. Tom's act was very popular and brought in a lot of money. By the time Tom was an adult, he had grown very rich. He had become a billionaire at the age of twenty-five.

Crowds filled the street of New York to have a look at their tiny wedding carriage.

Their wedding, which took place during the Civil War, provided a welcome escape from the sad problems of war.

And this ain't a piker's proposition. The cost of such a chronometer would have been divided between the three of us. I stand for its total cost.

He included them in his suicide note. They mark an ignoble end to a noble life, the leave taking of a truly great man. The same words could now be said for the company he left behind. Actually, the Eastman Kodak Company is through. It has been mismanaged financially, technologically and competitively. For 20 years, its leaders have foolishly spent down the patrimony of a century's prosperity. One of America's bedrock brands is about to disappear, the Kodak moment has passed. \n\nBut George Eastman is not how he died, and the Eastman Kodak Company is not how it is being killed. Though the ends be needless and premature, they must not be allowed to overshadow the greatness that came before. Few companies have done so much good for so many people, or defined and lifted so profoundly the spirit of a nation and perhaps the world. It is impossible to understand the 20th Century without recognizing the role of the Eastman Kodak Company. \n\nKodak served mankind through entertainment, science, national defense and the stockpiling of family memories. Kodak took us to the top of Mount Suribachi and to the Sea of Tranquility. It introduced us to the merry old Land of Oz and to stars from Charlie Chaplin to John Wayne, and Elizabeth Taylor to Tom Hanks. It showed us the shot that killed President Kennedy, and his brother bleeding out on a kitchen floor, and a fallen Martin Luther King Jr. on the hard balcony of a Memphis motel. When that sailor kissed the nurse, and when the spy planes saw missiles in Cuba, Kodak was the eyes of a nation. From the deck of the Missouri to the grandeur of Monument Valley, Kodak took us there. Virtually every significant image of the 20th Century is a gift to posterity from the Eastman Kodak Company. \n\nIn an era of easy digital photography, when we can take a picture of anything at any time, we cannot imagine what life was like before George Eastman brought photography to people. Yes, there were photographers, and for relatively large sums of money they would take stilted pictures in studios and formal settings. But most people couldn't afford photographs, and so all they had to remember distant loved ones, or earlier times of their lives, was memory. Children could not know what their parents had looked like as young people, grandparents far away might never learn what their grandchildren looked like. Eastman Kodak allowed memory to move from the uncertainty of recollection, to the permanence of a photograph. But it wasn't just people whose features were savable; it was events, the sacred and precious times that families cherish. The Kodak moment, was humanity's moment. \n\nAnd it wasn't just people whose features were savable; it was events, the precious times that familes cherish. Kodak let the fleeting moments of birthdays and weddings, picnics and parties, be preserved and saved. It allowed for the creation of the most egalitarian art form. Lovers could take one another's pictures, children were photographed walking out the door on the first day of school, \n\ndecided what was worth recording, and hundreds of millions of such decisions were made. And for centuries to come, those long dead will smile and dance and communicate to their unborn progeny. Family history will be not only names on paper, but smiles on faces. \n\nThe cash flow not just provided thousands of people with job, but also allowed the company's founder to engage in some of the most generous philanthropy in America's history. Not just in Kodak's home city of Rochester, New York, but in Tuskegee and London, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He bankrolled two historically black colleges, fixed the teeth of Europe's poor, and quietly did good wherever he could. While doing good, Kodak did very well. Over all the years, all the Kodakers over all the years are essential parts of that monumental legacy. They prospered a great company, but they - with that company - blessed the world. \n\nThat is what we should remember about the Eastman Kodak Company. \n\nLike its founder, we should remember how it lived, not how it died. \n\nHistory will forget the small men who have scuttled this company. \n\nBut history will never forget Kodak.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What company did he start?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did Kodak's leaders mismanage the company?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did Eastman do good for a lot of people?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "According to the article, will history ever forget Kodak?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does the author think it is important how Eastman died?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did Eastman engage in generous philanthropy?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was Kodak's home city?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did Eastman bankroll?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What replaced print photography?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 47, "span_end": 61, "span_text": "George Eastman", "input_text": "George Eastman", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 257, "span_end": 282, "span_text": "the Eastman Kodak Company", "input_text": "the Eastman Kodak Company", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 317, "span_text": " It has been mismanaged", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 759, "span_end": 814, "span_text": "Few companies have done so much good for so many people", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 4217, "span_end": 4253, "span_text": "But history will never forget Kodak.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 545, "span_end": 583, "span_text": "But George Eastman is not how he died,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 3472, "span_end": 3532, "span_text": "some of the most generous philanthropy in America's history.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 3566, "span_end": 3575, "span_text": "Rochester", "input_text": "Rochester", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 3679, "span_end": 3710, "span_text": "two historically black colleges", "input_text": "two historically black colleges", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1828, "span_end": 1847, "span_text": "digital photography", "input_text": "digital photography", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high15577.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3nkqq8o39y57ksfc83wyt4d8v9qdus", "filename": "Semiotics.txt", "story": "Semiotics (also called semiotic studies); is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication.

As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. \n\nSemiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication. Some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the life sciences\u2014such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). In general, semiotic theories take \"signs\" or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics (including zoosemiotics). \n\nThe term derives from the Greek \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \"s\u0113mei\u014dtikos\", \"observant of signs\", (from \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \"s\u0113meion\", \"a sign, a mark\",) and it was first used in English prior to 1676 by Henry Stubbes (spelt \"semeiotics\") in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs. John Locke used the term \"sem(e)iotike\" in book four, chapter 21 of \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690). Here he explains how science may be divided into three parts:", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the other name of Semiotics?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does it study?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Does it get mixed up with a tradition?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "With what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What tradition it belongs to?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does it fall under some other category?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "of what?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does it explore?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it same as linguistics?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do they have anything in common?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How the term came about?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does it mean?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "In what language?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is the root word?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What does it mean?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who first used it in English?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How did he spell it?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Which year?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who else used it around that time?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 23, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "semiotic studies", "input_text": "semiotic studies", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 58, "span_end": 72, "span_text": "meaning-making", "input_text": "meaning-making", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 157, "span_end": 170, "span_text": "confused with", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 203, "span_end": 212, "span_text": "semiology", "input_text": "semiology", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 175, "span_end": 185, "span_text": "Saussurean", "input_text": "Saussurean", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 224, "span_end": 231, "span_text": "subset ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 234, "span_end": 243, "span_text": "semiotics", "input_text": "semiotics", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 454, "span_end": 521, "span_text": "study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications.", "input_text": "study of signs and symbols", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 525, "span_end": 534, "span_text": "different", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 572, "span_end": 585, "span_text": "also studies ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 585, "span_end": 612, "span_text": "non-linguistic sign systems", "input_text": "non-linguistic sign systems", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1306, "span_end": 1317, "span_text": "s\u0113mei\u014dtikos", "input_text": "from s\u0113mei\u014dtikos", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1321, "span_end": 1339, "span_text": "observant of signs", "input_text": "observant of signs", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1287, "span_end": 1292, "span_text": "Greek", "input_text": "Greek", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1357, "span_end": 1364, "span_text": "s\u0113meion", "input_text": "s\u0113meion", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1368, "span_end": 1382, "span_text": "a sign, a mark", "input_text": "a sign, a mark", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1436, "span_end": 1449, "span_text": "Henry Stubbes", "input_text": "Henry Stubbes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1458, "span_end": 1468, "span_text": "semeiotics", "input_text": "semeiotics", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1419, "span_end": 1432, "span_text": "prior to 1676", "input_text": "prior to 1676", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1576, "span_end": 1586, "span_text": "John Locke", "input_text": "John Locke", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Semiotics.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3ifs6q0hjij8dq3ubc2950bx2hzis5", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Jacob Abbott___Caleb in the Country.txt/CHAPTER II_134ae88ffdcae089debfb8a362b4cec6a3d8f19b8db477609f57b3a", "story": "CHAPTER II. \n\nTROUBLE. \n\nAs Caleb walked along by the side of Raymond, and came upon the bridge, he was seen both by his grandmother, who happened to be standing at the door, and also at the same instant, by the two boys, Dwight and David, who were just then coming home from school.

But then, pretty soon, he was sorry, for it had been winter a long time, and he was impatient for the spring. \n\nAfter breakfast, he and Nathan read and studied for two hours, under their mother's direction. When they were released from these duties, Rollo proposed to Nathan that they should go out into the shed, and see how the storm came on. There was a large door in the shed, opening towards the street, where they could stand, protected from the wind, and see the drifts of snow. \n\nThey accordingly put on their caps, and went.

MoMA's collection offers an overview of modern and contemporary art, including works of architecture and design, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated books and artist's books, film, and electronic media. \n\nThe MoMA Library includes approximately 300,000 books and exhibition catalogs, over 1,000 periodical titles, and over 40,000 files of ephemera about individual artists and groups. The archives holds primary source material related to the history of modern and contemporary art. \n\nThe idea for The Museum of Modern Art was developed in 1929 primarily by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.) and two of her friends, Lillie P. Bliss and Mary Quinn Sullivan. They became known variously as \"the Ladies\", \"the daring ladies\" and \"the adamantine ladies\". They rented modest quarters for the new museum in the Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue (corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street) in Manhattan, and it opened to the public on November 7, 1929, nine days after the Wall Street Crash.

It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China. These findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier. On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year. The report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents. \"Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever.\" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America. \"We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.\" Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy-two thousand students. Why do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. \"The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students. Foreign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education. And from Learning English, that's the VOA Special English Education Report.

The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio.

The institution had done useful work in promoting good fellowship by means of healthful amusements, but recently its management had fallen into the hands of the younger men, and the founders contented themselves with an occasional visit to see that all was going well. Some, however, were not quite satisfied, and Mowbray entertained suspicions about the Club. He was an autocrat, but he shrank from spying, or attempting to coerce a member into betraying his comrades. Some allowance must be made for young blood; and, after all, nothing that really needed his interference could go on, he felt, without his learning about it. Nevertheless, he had a disturbing feeling that an undesirable influence was at work. \n\nCarlyon's room was unusually well furnished, and several fine London guns occupied a rack on the matchboarded wall. The cost of one would have purchased a dozen of the Massachusetts-made weapons which the prairie farmers used. The photograph of a horseman in English hunting dress with M.F.H. appended to the autograph was equally suggestive, and it was known that Carlyon's people had sent him to Canada with money enough to make a fair start. Unfortunately, he had not realized that success in farming demands care and strenuous work. \n\nHe sat with a flushed, excited face at a rosewood table, upon which the cigar ends, bottles, and glasses scarcely left room for the cards he was eagerly scanning.

Hilaire was 34. \n\nMore than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\nA few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, officially offering him medical insurance under the World Trade Center Health Program. About 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program, a representative told CNN. \n\nThese are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago. \n\nIn September 2012, federal health authorities added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. \n\nDr. John Howard, administrator of the WTC Health Program, had said the year before that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund. At the time, he said there was inadequate \"published scientific and medical findings\" to link 9/11 exposures to cancer.

He was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn the early 20th century, Russell led the British \"revolt against idealism\". He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote \"Principia Mathematica\", an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system), and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. \n\nRussell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed, and \"welcomed with enthusiasm\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, he concluded war against Adolf Hitler was a necessary \"lesser of two evils\". He criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.

But prosecutors said Young worked with Gouker to beat Zwicker as the teen suffocated in the mud of a ditch behind a Kentucky high school. \n\n\"Trey Zwicker was brutally murdered at age 14 ... because Josh Gouker is a control freak and because Josh Young wanted to impress him,\" prosecutor Elizabeth Brown told the jury in Jefferson County Circuit Court during Friday's closing arguments. She said Gouker was upset with Zwicker's mother after she aborted Gouker's unborn child, and he wanted revenge. \n\nJurors could have found Young guilty of murder whether they believed he acted alone or with someone else. The tampering with evidence charge accused Young of throwing away clothes and a bloody bat after the murder. \n\nBefore deliberations began, Brown told jurors not to feel sorry for the defendant because he's young or because he had a bad father or a bad life. \n\n\"You cannot let sympathy add reasonable doubt,\" Brown said. \"He was not coerced into doing this. He bragged about it, laughed about it.\" \n\nLeslie Smith, delivering the closing argument Friday for the defense, turned the spotlight on Gouker. She called him a \"jerk\" without a conscience and described him as a master manipulator who killed Zwicker alone.
