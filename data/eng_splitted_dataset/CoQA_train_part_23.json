Voting was underway Tuesday afternoon with several Republicans already voting for people other than Boehner. \n\nBad weather and the funeral proceedings for former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, however, made conservatives' challenge tougher as the two incidents combined ensured some lawmakers wouldn't make the vote. With fewer lawmakers voting, conservatives will need more Boehner opponents to force the vote to a second ballot. \n\nConservative call for Boehner coup grows louder \n\nStill, Monday morning conservatives were optimistic as more prominent members in their ranks came out opposed to the Speaker. Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while \"Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership.\" \n\nIncoming Rep. Curt Clawson, via tweet; South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan, via Facebook; and Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, via tweet, also joined the 10 lawmakers that announced their opposition to Boehner over the weekend and into Monday. Conservatives say they've locked down at least a dozen and as many as 15 certain no-votes, with more expected when the vote happens Tuesday afternoon. \n\nFlorida Rep. Ted Yoho, who is just starting his second term in the House, is one of the conservatives collaborating to spark a second round of voting, and has offered him up as an alternative to the Ohio Republican, along with Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert.

John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. \n\nJohn used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his messianic movement. Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus. Some scholars believe Jesus was a follower or disciple of John. This idea is strongly controverted, however, by John the Baptist's own words in scripture, although several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus' early followers had previously been followers of John. John the Baptist is also mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus. Some scholars maintain that John was influenced by the semi-ascetic Essenes, who expected an apocalypse and practiced rituals corresponding strongly with baptism, although no direct evidence substantiates this. \n\nAccording to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself.

By a process which had often perplexed her, and which she could never succeed in analysing, there had arisen in her mind, without any ostensible agency on the part of her mother which she could distinctly recall, a conviction that this was a topic on which she was never to speak. This idea had once haunted her, and she had seldom found herself alone without almost unconsciously musing over it. Notwithstanding the unvarying kindness of Lady Annabel, she exercised over her child a complete and unquestioned control. Venetia was brought up with strictness, which was only not felt to be severe, because the system was founded on the most entire affection, but, fervent as her love was for her mother, it was equalled by her profound respect, which every word and action of Lady Annabel tended to maintain. \n\nIn all the confidential effusions with Plantagenet, Venetia had never dwelt upon this mysterious subject; indeed, in these conversations, when they treated of their real and not ideal life, Venetia was a mere recipient: all that she could communicate, Plantagenet could observe; he it was who avenged himself at these moments for his habitual silence before third persons; it was to Venetia that he poured forth all his soul, and she was never weary of hearing his stories about Morpeth, and all his sorrows, disgusts, and afflictions. There was scarcely an individual in that little town with whom, from his lively narratives, she was not familiar; and it was to her sympathising heart that he confided all his future hopes and prospects, and confessed the strong pride he experienced in being a Cadurcis, which from all others was studiously concealed.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. \n\nIn ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. \n\nA Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \"sun-cure\". \n\nThere were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. \n\nIn winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. \n\nAlthough they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is attacking the lungs, unwise sunbathing may do great harm. \n\nToday there is not just one school in the sun. There are several in Switzerland, and since Switzerland is not the only country which has the right conditions, there are similar schools in other places.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who started an outdoor school in Switzerland?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How did they reach their destination in winter?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did they take their own desks and chairs with them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was one factor is choosing where to set up their desks?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Weren't the students cold?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Were they wearing a lot of clothing?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Then why weren't they freezing?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is there a condition in which sunlight can be dangerous?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What is that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where in Switzerland is Rollier's school?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is it the only one in the country?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Which rays have the greatest effect?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does fog do to ultra violet rays?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Are they stronger near big cities?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What things did Dr. Rollier believe helped fix many diseases?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Any others?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What do people from Northern Europe spend a lot of time on during the winter?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What ancient civilization was aware of the sun's powers?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 712, "span_end": 727, "span_text": "Auguste Rollier", "input_text": "Auguste Rollier", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1499, "span_end": 1512, "span_text": "on their skis", "input_text": "on skis", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1551, "span_end": 1587, "span_text": " They carried small desks and chairs", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1588, "span_end": 1617, "span_text": "as well as their school books", "input_text": "school books", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1706, "span_end": 1731, "span_text": " was free from cold winds", "input_text": "was free from cold winds", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1689, "span_end": 1702, "span_text": "faced the sun", "input_text": "faced the sun", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1835, "span_end": 1873, "span_text": "Roller's pupils were very seldom cold.", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1796, "span_end": 1834, "span_text": "Although they wore hardly any clothes,", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1873, "span_end": 1951, "span_text": " That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun", "input_text": "their bodies were full of energy", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2009, "span_end": 2101, "span_text": " If, for example, tuberculosis is attacking the lungs, unwise sunbathing may do great harm.

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004\u201309) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was their band earlier?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Now what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When did Mercury start with them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was his real name?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who suggested the new name?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the name?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who joined them next?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was their first chart in UK?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which year was that?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was their first international success?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "In which year?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was there a specific track mentionable?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What was its success?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did they do well in any other format?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Are there any examples?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was their achievement in the 80s?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Any example?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How it is ranked?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What happened to Mercury?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How about Deacon?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 90, "span_text": "Before forming Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile", "input_text": "Smile", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 91, "span_text": "Before forming Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile.", "input_text": "Queen", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 273, "span_end": 304, "span_text": "Mercury joined the band in 1970", "input_text": "1970", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 92, "span_end": 166, "span_text": "Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara", "input_text": "Farrokh Bulsara", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 273, "span_end": 342, "span_text": "Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name", "input_text": "Mercury", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 306, "span_end": 342, "span_text": "suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name", "input_text": "Queen", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 381, "span_end": 461, "span_text": "John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973", "input_text": "John Deacon", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 527, "span_text": "Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II,", "input_text": "Queen II", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 535, "span_text": "Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974", "input_text": "1974", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 602, "span_end": 673, "span_text": "A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success.

Sailing on, with open eyes, we slept the wakeful sleep of those, who to the body only give repose, while the spirit still toils on, threading her mountain passes. \n\nKing Media's slumbers were like the helmed sentry's in the saddle. From them, he started like an antlered deer, bursting from out a copse. Some said he never slept; that deep within himself he but intensified the hour; or, leaving his crowned brow in marble quiet, unseen, departed to far-off councils of the gods. Howbeit, his lids never closed; in the noonday sun, those crystal eyes, like diamonds, sparkled with a fixed light. \n\nAs motionless we thus reclined, Media turned and muttered:--\"Brother gods, and demi-gods, it is not well. These mortals should have less or more. Among my subjects is a man, whose genius scorns the common theories of things; but whose still mortal mind can not fathom the ocean at his feet. His soul's a hollow, wherein he raves.\" \n\n\"List, list,\" whispered Yoomy--\"our lord is dreaming; and what a royal dream.\" \n\n\"A very royal and imperial dream,\" said Babbalanja--\"he is arraigning me before high heaven;--ay, ay; in dreams, at least, he deems himself a demi-god.\" \n\n\"Hist,\" said Mohi--\"he speaks again.\" \n\n\"Gods and demi-gods!

He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. \n\nBorn and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager; his first band, the Quarrymen, was named the Silver Beatles, and finally evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a sporadic solo career that produced albums including \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"Imagine\", and songs such as \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Working Class Hero\", and \"Imagine\". After he married Yoko Ono in 1969, he added \"Ono\" as one of his middle names. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album \"Double Fantasy\". He was shot and killed in front of his Manhattan apartment three weeks after its release. \n\nLennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved from London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was Lennon born?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What year?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was his birth name?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where was he born?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was he raised there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was popular when he was a teen?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he have a band?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was his first band?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was it renamed?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was it in 1960?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How long did that last", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many years was that?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was it a popular group?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 52, "span_end": 62, "span_text": "9 October ", "input_text": "9 October", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 77, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "1980", "input_text": "1980", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 30, "span_end": 50, "span_text": " John Winston Lennon", "input_text": "John Winston Lennon", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 373, "span_end": 382, "span_text": "Liverpool", "input_text": "Liverpool", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 354, "span_end": 382, "span_text": "Born and raised in Liverpool", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 413, "span_end": 428, "span_text": " skiffle craze ", "input_text": "skiffle craze", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 442, "span_end": 457, "span_text": " his first band", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 472, "span_text": "Quarrymen", "input_text": "Quarrymen", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 474, "span_end": 503, "span_text": "was named the Silver Beatles,", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 488, "span_end": 502, "span_text": "Silver Beatles", "input_text": "Silver Beatles", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 533, "span_end": 541, "span_text": "Beatles ", "input_text": "Beatles", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 565, "span_end": 582, "span_text": "disbanded in 1970", "input_text": "1960 to 1970", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 565, "span_end": 582, "span_text": "disbanded in 1970", "input_text": "10 years", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 532, "span_end": 549, "span_text": " Beatles in 1960.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "John_Lennon.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "33ppungg385i71srwrqqfl9rbihrz1", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Thomas Carlyle___History of Friedrich II of Prussia, Volume 13.txt/Chapter XI_ca705dd86305c96678136ebec5de9729b82eeaee2c641068f83c693", "story": "Chapter XI. --NUSSLER IN NEISSE, WITH THE OLD DESSAUER AND WALRAVE. \n\nThe Old Dessauer with part of his 20,000,--aided by Boy Dietrich (KNABE, \"Knave Dietrich,\" as one might fondly call him) and the Moravian Meal-wagons,--accomplished his Troppau-Jablunka Problem perfectly well; cleaning the Mountains, and keeping them clean, of that Pandour rabble, as he was the man to do.

Huqi's team decided to sell educational books in front of the Children Activity Centre. They thought parents would like to buy books for their children. But unfortunately , they came across urban management officers . The officers asked them to leave. \"We played hide-and-seek with the officers for the whole morning,\" said Hu. \"Finally we gave up and moved to other place. Wang Yongyi and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying the money was to help the \"Project Hope\" for country kids. It worked. More people came to their stall. A foreigner even gave them 100 yuan. Meng Zhaoxiang and his team were luckier. They sold all their cakes in four hours, spending 39.5 yuan and getting back 80 yuan. \"It was not easy to make the money,\" said Meng. \"Some people just looked. Others just tasted but didn't buy. Now I know how hard it is for our parents to earn the money we need to lead happy lives.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Whose team sold books?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many teams were there?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many pupils made up these groups?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "From what level classes?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What educational institution participates in this?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was the sale named \"Yard Sale\"?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was it named?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How many items were for sale?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did the shopkeepers ask them to stop?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did they name the charity on the sign?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who donated a large sum?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How much was it?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was it hard to get the cash?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How long did it take?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did they spend more than they made?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What sort of game did they play with the cops?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What sort of cops were they?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Were they rural cops?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 415, "span_end": 421, "span_text": "Huqi's", "input_text": "Huqi's", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 219, "span_text": "112 teams", "input_text": "112 teams", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 151, "span_end": 160, "span_text": "About 800", "input_text": "About 800", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 161, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "Junior 1 and Junior 2", "input_text": "Junior 1 and Junior 2", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 45, "span_end": 75, "span_text": "Hangzhou Yongjin Middle School", "input_text": "Hangzhou Yongjin Middle School", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 123, "span_end": 140, "span_text": "\"making a living\"", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 123, "span_end": 140, "span_text": "\"making a living\"", "input_text": "\"making a living\"", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 298, "span_end": 501, "span_text": "Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets.

Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. \n\nInternet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, and colocation. \n\nThe Internet was developed as a network between government research laboratories and participating departments of universities. By the late 1980s, a process was set in place towards public, commercial use of the Internet. The remaining restrictions were removed by 1995, 4 years after the introduction of the World Wide Web. \n\nIn 1989, the first ISPs were established in Australia and the United States. In Brookline, Massachusetts, The World became the first commercial ISP in the US. Its first customer was served in November 1989. \n\nOn 23 April 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position. A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, in the form of a U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (\"with some caveats\") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure net neutrality. The FCC is expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote, according to the New York Times.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is an ISP?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does ISP stand for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was the first one started in the US?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was it called?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the internet?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When was it becoming available to the general population?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What things does an ISP generally provide?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When was the government thinking about letting them offer fast and slow packages?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who is Susan Crawford?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was her answer to threats to net neutrality?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What would happen if broadband was called a telecommunications service?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did Obama want to do about it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "who wanted to prevent more rules on ISPs?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is the upcoming vote going to support net neutrality?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 41, "span_end": 111, "span_text": "organization that provides services for accessing, using, the Internet", "input_text": "organization that provides services for accessing, using, the Internet", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 2, "span_end": 28, "span_text": " Internet service provider", "input_text": "Internet service provider", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 744, "span_end": 820, "span_text": "In 1989, the first ISPs were established in Australia and the United States.", "input_text": "In 1989", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 821, "span_end": 848, "span_text": "In Brookline, Massachusetts", "input_text": "In Brookline, Massachusetts", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 850, "span_end": 901, "span_text": "The World became the first commercial ISP in the US", "input_text": "The World", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 433, "span_end": 497, "span_text": " developed as a network between government research laboratories", "input_text": "developed as a network between government research laboratories", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 903, "span_end": 950, "span_text": "Its first customer was served in November 1989.", "input_text": "November 1989.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 265, "span_end": 415, "span_text": "services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, and colocation.

However, she felt very lucky, no other girl had so many friends at school and in the neighborhood. But everything changed on National Friendship Day.

Foreseeing the need for a computerized resource that can be used for biological interpretation of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. It is a collection of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing experimental knowledge on metabolism and various other functions of the cell and the organism. Each pathway map contains a network of molecular interactions and reactions and is designed to link genes in the genome to gene products (mostly proteins) in the pathway. This has enabled the analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content in the genome is compared with the KEGG PATHWAY database to examine which pathways and associated functions are likely to be encoded in the genome. \n\nAccording to the developers, KEGG is a \"computer representation\" of the biological system. It integrates building blocks and wiring diagrams of the system \u2014 more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes and proteins, chemical building blocks of small molecules and reactions, and wiring diagrams of molecular interaction and reaction networks.

They fell at speeds reaching 140mph, past the highest ridges of the snow-covering Himalayas, before each released a parachute . The jumpers wore oxygen masks to keep their lungs working as they fell. Wearing neoprene underwear was compulsory -- to prevent them from being frozen to death. \n\nThe adventure, advertised by its organizers as \"a feast for those who seek to stimulate all their senses to the full\", appeared to have lived up to its billing. \"I had never seen so many mountains before,\" Ms Smith said. \"To be on top of the world was simply stunning .\" \n\nThe expedition also offered a way by which to celebrate her 30th birthday later this month, she said. Besides, her jump raised funds for charities in Britain and Nepal, including more than PS10,000 for the Hampshire Autistic Society. \n\nIn the next few days the feat will be repeated by about 30 others, weather permitting.

The king's brother, Nigel Bruce, was carried to Berwick, and was there hanged and beheaded.

people as we possibly can,\" he said. \"We do have a few leads coming in.\" An autopsy is to be carried out Monday morning. \n\nBiven described the track's backside as \"like a mini city,\" with 48

He was unconscious when emergency responders found him, but he died later at the hospital, police said. \n\nAn autopsy on Homer is complete, but authorities are not releasing details, citing pending toxicology results, Tami Sedivy-Schroder, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said Tuesday. Results can take up to eight weeks, she said. \n\nHomer's mother, Connie Homer, told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was a big Braves fan who was attending the game with a friend. \n\n\"I'm just sick,\" she said. \"We're a very close family.

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show. \n\nIn 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of \"SNL\"s cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera.

He was a big, reserved, fair-haired man, with a fleshy face that was redeemed from heaviness by his eyes, which were restless and keen. Though supposed to be an Austrian, little was known about him or his antecedents except that he owned the next half-section of land to Jernyngham's and farmed it successfully. It was, however, believed that he was of an unusually grasping nature, and his neighbors took precautions when they made a deal with him. He had reached the shadow of a poplar bluff when he heard hurried footsteps and a man with a hot face came into sight. \n\n\"I'm going across your place to save time; I want my horse,\" he explained hastily. \"Curtis, the policeman, has ridden in to the settlement and told me to go up and search a muskeg near the north trail with Stanton. Somebody's killed Jernyngham and hidden him there.\" \n\n\"So!\" exclaimed Wandle. \"Jernyngham murdered! You tell me that?\" \n\n\"Sure thing!\" the other replied. \"The police have figured out how it all happened and I'm going to look for the body while Curtis reports to his bosses. A blamed pity! I liked Jernyngham. Well, I must get to the muskeg soon as I can!\" \n\nHe ran on, and Wandle led his horses to the pool and stood thinking hard while they drank. He was well versed in Jernyngham's affairs and knew that he had once bought a cheap quarter-section of land in an arid belt some distance off. A railroad had since entered the district, irrigation work had been begun, and the holding must have risen in value. Now, it seemed, Jernyngham was dead, which was unfortunate, because Wandle had found their joint operations profitable, and it was very probable that Ellice and himself were the only persons who knew about the land. Wandle mounted one of the horses and set out for Jernyngham's homestead at its fastest pace.

So Mr. Rossi wrote a letter to the school, which has been shared by thousands of parents online. Dear Mrs. Marbyry, While I am thankful for your concern for our children and the best education our kids receive from you, I can promise you they've learned as much in the three days we were in Boston as they would in a whole year in school. Although they missed an important test, they learned about something more important for them, especially for their future. They experienced first -hand the love and support form thousands of other people with a common goal. At the marathon , which is known as the most difficult one in the world, they watched runners with disabilities work together to collect money for children in poor areas. In addition, our children walked the Freedom Trail, visited the site of the Boston Tea Party and the graves of several great pioneers of America. These are thing they WILL learn in school a year or more from now. We truly love our school and teachers. But I wouldn't hesitate to pull them out of school again for an experience like the one they had this time. Thank you for your time.

On the second day after his recognition of Eva, he had held that conversation with Fakredeen which had determined the young Emir not to lose a moment in making the effort to induce Amalek to forego his ransom, the result of which he had communicated to Eva on their subsequent interview. On the third day, Tancred rose from his couch, and would even have quitted the tent, had not Baroni dissuaded him. He was the more induced to do so, for on this day he missed his amusing companion, the Emir. It appeared from the account of Baroni, that his highness had departed at dawn, on his dromedary, and without an attendant. According to Baroni, nothing was yet settled either as to the ransom or the release of Tancred. It seemed that the great Sheikh had been impatient to return to his chief encampment, and nothing but the illness of Tancred would probably have induced him to remain in the Stony Arabia as long as he had done.

He survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which was damaged by the attackers. \n\nWhen the officers arrived, the attackers were running out of the ticket hall, attacking people with long knives. \n\nXie and his colleagues tried to stop the attack, which is when Xie was injured. In addition to the deep cuts, his skull was fractured, and at the time of writing he was awaiting further surgery. \n\n\"A wave of fierce anger rose up in my mind, and we all forgot to think about the possible danger to us,\" said Hu Zhe, 23, a police officer trainee at the Beijinglu Police Station. \n\nHaving no firearm, he fought the terrorists with a wooden baton, but it got broken in the fighting.

"(CNN) -- Money talks -- that's hardly a revelation, but the overriding feeling towards Saturday's David Haye versus Dereck Chisora \"circus fight\" in London is shock and outrage that it could even take place. \n\nWith neither fighter holding a British boxing license, promoter Frank Warren had to resort to asking the little-known Luxembourg federation to sanction the bout. \n\nIt has since been expelled from the European Boxing Union for agreeing to give legitimacy to an event that no-one else would touch. \n\nChisora was banned by the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control following his bust-up with Haye in Munich in February, while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired. \n\nTheir ugly scuffle at a press conference after Chisora's defeat by Vitali Klitschko, which Haye attended, has set the scene for a showdown straight from the pages of the professional wrestling handbook. \n\nTheir pantomime behavior has only served to rack up the ticket sales to close to 30,000 and secure airtime in 60 countries worldwide. \n\nChisora threatens to shoot Haye \n\n\"Chisora's not a nice guy, the fact he bites people in the ring, spits water in peoples' faces, slaps people at weigh-ins, kisses people at weigh-ins. What's to like?\" Haye said this week. \n\nBoxing commentator Steve Bunce has compared Haye and Chisora's Munich brawl to Lennox Lewis' pre-fight rumble with Mike Tyson a decade ago. Lewis punched Tyson, and in exchange the American bit his leg. This was heralded at the time as the biggest fight ever.

There was about it none of the garishness, the almost resplendent brilliancy associated with the abodes of many of our neighbours. Although her masseuse confidently assured her that she looked twenty-eight, Mrs. Hastings preferred not to put the matter to the test. She received her carefully selected dinner guests in a great library with cedarwood walls, furnished with almost Victorian sobriety, and illuminated by myriads of hidden lights. Pamela, being a relative, received the special consideration of an affectionately bestowed embrace. \n\n\"Pamela, my child, wasn't it splendid I heard that you were in New York!\" she exclaimed. \"Quite by accident, too. I think you treat your relatives shamefully.\" \n\nHer niece laughed. \n\n\"Well, anyhow, you're the first of them I've seen at all, and directly Jim told me he was coming to you, I made him ring up in case you had room for me.\" \n\n\"Jimmy was a dear,\" Mrs. Hastings declared, \"and, of course, there couldn't be a time when there wouldn't be room for you. Even now, at the last moment, though, I haven't quite made up my mind where to put you. Choose, dear.

Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480 (2013), it is the least densely populated country in the world. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements. \n\nGreenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada. Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, and Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th\u00a0century. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it \"Terra do Lavrador\" (later applied to Labrador in Canada).

Then there were two letters which had to be laid side by side and compared before she could make out the truth of their story, and even when she knew the facts she could not decide what to make of them; and finally she had to reflect upon a great many pages from a cousin who found himself in financial difficulties, which forced him to the uncongenial occupation of teaching the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin. \n\nBut the two letters which each told the same story differently were the chief source of her perplexity.

This state of things had been discovered by Mrs. Milvain, her aunt Celia, a zealous inquirer into such matters, whose letter was also under consideration.

They want to fly, or to become a dinosaur, or to learn how to act like Spiderman. Luka Tavcar, 12, has muscular dystrophy and is totally dependent on his wheelchair. Nevertheless, late last year, he had an inspired plan: to be photographed walking around and having fun. He approached Matej Peljhan, an amateur photographer and a psychologist at CIRIUS rehabilitation center near Ljubljana, Slovenia, where Luka is a patient. At first, Peljhan was perplexed. How could he photograph a boy who can not move or act in motion? \"Luka wanted to see himself playing and having fun, but it seemed impossible,\" he says. Then Peljhan had a brainstorm: Luka could lie down on a piece of cloth and, with the help of an assistant, Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard, and playing basketball. Then Peljhan would shoot these images from above. The photos took about a month to produce; all were shot early this year. Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child, says his own disabilities motivated him to make the photographs. \"I understand people with limitations,\" he says. He named the series \"The Little Prince\" after the French story by Antoine de Saint-Exupery in which a boy teaches a man about trust, hope, and friendship. Luka loves the photos. Matej himself understands what it is like to live with limitations--he lost his right arm and left eye as a child.\"Luka wants to stay positive and his imagination helps him forget his physical limitation,\" says Peljhan. \"He's fragile, but he can see the world differently.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is Luka's impairment?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How does he get around?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did he want to do last year?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who would take the pictures?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did he work?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where is that located?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did Peljhan think this was a normal request?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Luka lie down on?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And what did Peljhan do with him?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long did it take to make all the photos?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was Peljhan's disability?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What did he call the photo series?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was Luka satisfied with the pictures?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 198, "span_end": 216, "span_text": "muscular dystrophy", "input_text": "muscular dystrophy", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 259, "span_text": "his wheelchair", "input_text": "his wheelchair", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 315, "span_end": 364, "span_text": " to be photographed walking around and having fun", "input_text": "to be photographed walking around and having fun", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 380, "span_end": 393, "span_text": "Matej Peljhan", "input_text": "Matej Peljhan", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 441, "span_end": 469, "span_text": "CIRIUS rehabilitation center", "input_text": "CIRIUS rehabilitation center", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 475, "span_end": 494, "span_text": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "input_text": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 552, "span_text": "Peljhan was perplexed", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 761, "span_end": 777, "span_text": "a piece of cloth", "input_text": "a piece of cloth", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 814, "span_end": 912, "span_text": "Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard", "input_text": "Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1010, "span_end": 1017, "span_text": "a month", "input_text": "a month", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1061, "span_end": 1116, "span_text": "Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child", "input_text": "he lost his right arm and left eye", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1253, "span_end": 1270, "span_text": "The Little Prince", "input_text": "The Little Prince", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1387, "span_end": 1408, "span_text": "Luka loves the photos", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "high19297.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bor509d", "filename": "United_States_dollarUnited_States_dollar_91ffb035d938bf91165a8d959c9b5f561dc71abc7841ad578ea2e1ac", "story": "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is the US dollar on a decimal system?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What country's dollar is not?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is a mill?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "And a cent?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And the dime?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What's the symbol for a mill?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "And that for cent?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How much is an eagle?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What are these coins made of?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was making $100 as a union proposed?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Were union coins made?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Were there patterns for it?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What about for the half union?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When are mills used in regular life?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When else?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How are values less than a dollar given out?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Are there one dollar coins?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Are they common?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was occasionally issued for values under a dollar?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How much is a double eagle?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 37, "span_end": 92, "span_text": "U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values.

Its principal aims include accelerating economic growth, social progress, and sociocultural evolution among its members, alongside the protection of regional stability and the provision of a mechanism for member countries to resolve differences peacefully. ASEAN is an official United Nations Observer. Communication by members across nations takes place in English. \n\nASEAN covers a land area of 4.4\u00a0million square kilometres, 3% of the total land area of Earth. ASEAN territorial waters cover an area about three times larger than its land counterpart. Member countries have a combined population of approximately 625 million people, 8.8% of the world's population. In 2015, the organisation's combined nominal GDP had grown to more than US$2.8\u00a0trillion.

That would help him receive another wish: Getting reelected as president of the United States. \n\nUnfortunately for Obama, and tragically for the people in Syria, history has brought the American presidential campaign and the Syrian revolution to the same pages of the calendar. That means Obama will do whatever he can, for as long as he can, to keep the carnage in Syria from interfering with his reelection plan. \n\nThat means the killings in Syria could go on longer than if the uprising had erupted during a nonelection year. \n\nAnyone who doubts that electoral considerations have become a major factor in U.S. foreign policy should look to Obama's own words from a few months ago. Obama did not realize his microphone was on during a meeting in Seoul with then-Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, so he leaned in close and whispered, \"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\" In this instance, Obama was referring to the contentious issue of missile defense. \n\nIt's not uncommon for presidents to worry about reelection while charting foreign policy. In Robert Caro's new biography of President Lyndon B. Johnson, \"The Passage of Power,\" he describes how Johnson made decisions about Vietnam with an eye towards the elections.

This is achieved through the use of a turntable , which usually moves the food in a circle when it is pushed by those at the table. In this way, the food never has to be picked up and passed around the table. Instead, it remains in place on the lazy Susan. \n\nA lazy Susan may also be a part of a kitchen cabinet . In this sense, the lazy Susan is a type of shelving unit within the cabinet that is able to turn around its axis . One may turn the lazy Susan in order to find certain goods in storage. From the outside, a lazy Susan appears to be two cabinets that are located at a right angle to each another. When one of these cabinets is pushed, however, both doors move and the lazy Susan is revealed inside. \n\nIt is believed that Thomas Jefferson invented the lazy Susan in the 18th century, though it was called \"dumbwaiter\" at that time. It is said that Jefferson invented the lazy Susan because his daughter complained she was always served last at table and, as a result, never found herself full when leaving the table. Others believe that Thomas Edison was the inventor, as he is believed to have invented the turntable for his phonograph . The turntable may have developed into the lazy Susan later. \n\nRegardless of who invented it, it wasn't until 1917 that the term \"lazy Susan\" was used in an advertisement for the invention. In Britain, however, the term \"dumbwaiter\" is still used rather than \"lazy Susan\". The reason for the naming of it is still a mystery.

Until the mid-19th century, the term \"Kashmir\" denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (subdivided into Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh divisions), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract. \n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir Shaivism arose. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the \"Salatin-i-Kashmir\" or Shah Mir dynasty. Kashmir was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751, and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir.

At one o'clock in the morning Leigh rose and, with his three followers, started for the village. It was but twenty minutes' walk. Not a soul was stirring, not a light visible in any window. \n\nThey found that three or four boats were lying by the bank. Leigh chose the smallest of these and, loosening the head rope from the post to which it was fastened, took his place in her with the others. Accustomed as he was to rowing, from his childhood, he soon reached the opposite bank. Here he fastened the boat up, and struck across country until he reached the road. Then he sent one of his followers westward. \n\n\"You will follow the road,\" he said, \"until within a mile of Tours; then you will conceal yourself, and watch who passes along. If you see a large body of troops coming, you will at once strike across country and make your way down to the village above that at which we crossed. You heard the instructions that I gave to Pierre. If you find him and the others there with the boat, you will report what you have seen. He will send another messenger on with the news to Cathelineau, and you will remain with him until I arrive. \n\n\"If he is not there, you will follow the bank of the river down to the other village. You will give a shout as you pass the spot where we halted. If no answer comes, you will probably find Pierre and the boat somewhere below.

Jesuits work in education (founding schools, colleges, universities, and seminaries), intellectual research, and cultural pursuits. Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, sponsor direct social ministries, and promote ecumenical dialogue. \n\nIgnatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman from the Pyrenees area of northern Spain, founded the society after discerning his spiritual vocation while recovering from a wound sustained in the Battle of Pamplona. He composed the \"Spiritual Exercises\" to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. In 1534, Ignatius and six other young men, including Francis Xavier and Peter Faber, gathered and professed vows of poverty, chastity, and later obedience, including a special vow of obedience to the Pope in matters of mission direction and assignment. Ignatius's plan of the order's organization was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540 by a bull containing the \"Formula of the Institute\". \n\nIgnatius was a nobleman who had a military background, and the members of the society were supposed to accept orders anywhere in the world, where they might be required to live in extreme conditions. Accordingly, the opening lines of the founding document declared that the society was founded for \"whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God to strive especially for the defence and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine.\" Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as \"God's soldiers\", \"God's marines\", or \"the Company\", which evolved from references to Ignatius' history as a soldier and the society's commitment to accepting orders anywhere and to endure any conditions.

He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. \n\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species\", overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life. \n\nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College) encouraged his passion for natural science.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins.

The history of geodesy began in antiquity and blossomed during the Age of Enlightenment. \n\nEarly ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see flat Earth), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that Polaris is seen lower in the sky as one travels South. \n\nThe early Greeks, in their speculation and theorizing, ranged from the flat disc advocated by Homer to the spherical body postulated by Pythagoras. Pythagoras's idea was supported later by Aristotle. Pythagoras was a mathematician and to him the most perfect figure was a sphere. He reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure and therefore the Earth was created to be spherical in shape. Anaximenes, an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was rectangular in shape. \n\nSince the spherical shape was the most widely supported during the Greek Era, efforts to determine its size followed. Plato determined the circumference of the Earth (which is slightly over 40,000\u00a0km) to be 400,000 stadia (between 62,800 and 74,000\u00a0km or 46,250 and 39,250\u00a0mi) while Archimedes estimated 300,000 stadia (48,300\u00a0km or 30,000\u00a0mi), using the Hellenic stadion which scholars generally take to be 185 meters or of a geographical mile.

A news agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire, or news service. \n\nAlthough there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information. All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. Jonathan Fenby explains the philosophy: \n\nTo achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises \u2013 or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality. \n\nOnly a few large newspapers could afford bureaus outside their home city. They relied instead on news agencies, especially Havas (founded 1835) in France and the Associated Press (founded 1846) in the United States. Former Havas employees founded Reuters in 1851 in Britain and Wolff in 1849 in Germany; Havas is now Agence France-Presse (AFP). For international news, the agencies pooled their resources, so that Havas, for example, covered the French Empire, South America and the Balkans and shared the news with the other national agencies. In France the typical contract with Havas provided a provincial newspaper with 1800 lines of telegraphed text daily, for an annual subscription rate of 10,000 francs.

It is the most wonderful experience in the world.\" \n\n\"You will find our new times full of wonderful experiences,\" said Lincoln. \"I do not know what you will care to do now.

The country is expected to hold a referendum on July 29, when Romanians will have to vote whether they want Basescu to remain in office. \n\nDuring the suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the president of the Senate, will assume the interim presidency.

This position allows him to assume the president's attributions, in case the latter is suspended, according to the Constitution. \n\nCrin Antonescu said on Friday he is ready to step out of politics if Basescu wins the referendum. \n\nDuring his speech in parliament, before the vote, Basescu accused the ruling coalition of taking control of the country's judicial system and public institutions. \n\nHe also expressed concern about the country's state of law and said this political turmoil will have long-term negative impacts on Romania. \n\n\"Take care of the country!\" Basescu said at the end of his speech. It is the second time Basescu has faced suspension since he took the power, eight years ago. The first time was in 2007, after which he won a referendum and returned to office. \n\nEarlier on Friday, Romania's Constitutional Court gave an ambiguous statement regarding the constitutional status of this impeachment motion. The judges approved some of the points from the motion, but they didn't make it clear whether Basescu has violated the Constitution or not. In any case, the Court played an advisory role this time, leaving the final word to the Parliament.

The conference and proceedings that resulted sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other. Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity (biodiversity) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy. The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, conservation behavior and conservation physiology.

An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. \n\nPython features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation. \n\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system Amoeba. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL).", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was thought of in the eighties?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What year was it implemented?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And the month?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "By whom?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where at?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was it replacing?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did they initially release it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Does it only cater to an elite few?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did it primarily focus on?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did it emphasize?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "An example of this?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Does it take more to create less than other applications?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What alternative applications does it outdo in that aspect?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does it only work in little projects?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many program archetypes does it support?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "An example?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Any others?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Does it only work on one certain OS?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Is the library big or little?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who manages the communal version?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1185, "span_end": 1223, "span_text": "Python was conceived in the late 1980s", "input_text": "Python", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1228, "span_end": 1271, "span_text": " its implementation began in December 1989 ", "input_text": "1989", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1228, "span_end": 1270, "span_text": " its implementation began in December 1989", "input_text": "December", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1229, "span_end": 1290, "span_text": "its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum", "input_text": "Guido van Rossum", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1271, "span_end": 1326, "span_text": "by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (", "input_text": "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1350, "span_end": 1384, "span_text": "as a successor to the ABC language", "input_text": "the ABC language", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 144, "span_text": "created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.", "input_text": "1991", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 35, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "programming language for general-purpose programming", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 170, "span_end": 233, "span_text": "Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability", "input_text": "code readability", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 216, "span_end": 334, "span_text": " code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords)", "input_text": "using whitespace indentation", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 372, "span_end": 467, "span_text": " to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java", "input_text": "fewer", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 392, "span_end": 467, "span_text": " in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java", "input_text": "C++ and Java", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 521, "span_end": 575, "span_text": "writing clear programs on both a small and large scale", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 653, "span_end": 692, "span_text": "supports multiple programming paradigms", "input_text": "multiple", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 780, "span_text": " including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles.

They were busy counting wild birds on Mount Vernon's wetlands, south of Washington, D.C. They began in the middle of December and worked until the beginning of January, 2015. \n\nThe birdwatchers were among 70,000 volunteers who collected information for the National Audubon Society, a U.S. conservation group. They counted birds in more than 2,400 areas in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean Sea and other parts of the Americas. \n\nThe Audubon Society's first \"Christmas Bird Count\" took place 115 years ago in 1900. At that time, a man named Frank Chapman suggested a new Christmas tradition that people count birds instead of shooting them around the holiday. \n\nHarry Glasgow has taken part in the Christmas Bird Count for the past 10 years. This year, he was one of the volunteer birdwatchers at Mount Vernon. \n\n\"I think it's a tremendous use of a lot of unofficial talent around the nation to keep track of birds. Birds are one of the surest indicators of the health of ecology.\" \n\nLast year, the bird count recorded over 66 million birds of 2,403 different species. \n\nGary Langham is chief scientist with the National Audubon Society. \n\n\"The Audubon climate report says that half the birds in North America -- 314 out of 588 species -- are seriously threatened by climate change. The impacts sort of cut across all birds, all sizes, all kinds, all places.\" \n\nInformation from the bird counts has shown that birds are staying farther north during the winter months because of warmer weather. Birdwatcher Jaime Reidy has noted the difference close to Washington, in the state of Virginia. \n\n\"You get to see them at odd times of the year, a little earlier, staying a little later.\" \n\nGary Langham says other conditions are affecting bird populations. \n\n\"You can imagine the birds that live along the beach or along the rocky shore line as sea levels are rising around the world. That is impacting them, you know.\" \n\nDavid Yarnold is president of the Audubon Society. In his words, \"Christmas Bird Count data is becoming important not only in documenting current climate change, but in predicting the future effects of climate change on North American bird populations.

Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson used it on their way to their weddings, along with three other brides: Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who married the future King George VI in 1923; Princess Alexandra in 1963; and Princess Anne in 1973. \n\nThe wedding procession will take in some of central London's most famous sights.

authoritative scripture. The English word \"canon\" comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, meaning \"rule\" or \"measuring stick\". Christians became the first to use the term in reference to scripture, but Eugene Ulrich regards the idea as Jewish. \n\nMost of the canons listed below are considered \"closed\" (i.e., books cannot be added or removed), reflecting a belief that public revelation has ended and thus some person or persons can gather approved inspired texts into a complete and authoritative canon, which scholar Bruce Metzger defines as \"an authoritative collection of books\". In contrast, an \"open canon\", which permits the addition of books through the process of continuous revelation, Metzger defines as \"a collection of authoritative books\". \n\nThese canons have developed through debate (canonology) and agreement on the part of the religious authorities of their respective faiths and denominations. Believers consider canonical books as inspired by God or as expressive of the authoritative history of the relationship between God and his people. Some books such as the Jewish-Christian gospels, have been excluded from various canons altogether, but many disputed books\u2014considered non-canonical or even apocryphal by some\u2014are considered to be Biblical apocrypha or Deuterocanonical or fully canonical by others. Differences exist between the Jewish Tanakh and Christian biblical canons, although the Jewish Tanakh did form the basis for the Christian Old Testament, and between the canons of different Christian denominations. The differing criteria and processes of canonization dictate what the various communities regard as inspired scripture. In some cases where varying strata of scriptural inspiration have accumulated, it becomes prudent to discuss texts that only have an elevated status within a particular tradition. This becomes even more complex when considering the open canons of the various Latter Day Saint sects\u2014which one may view as extensions of Christianity (and thus of Judaism)\u2014and the scriptural revelations purportedly given to several leaders over the years within that movement.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where does the English word Canon come from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What have the caonons developed through?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How does Bruce Metzger define an Authoritive canon?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does an open cannon permit?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How does Metzger define an open canon?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Are there differences in the Jewish Tanakh and Christian biblical canons?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is the definition of the greek word canon comes from?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where does it become prudent to discuss texts that only have an elevated status within a particular tradition?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did the Jewish Tanakh for the basis for the Christian Old Testament?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What group became the first to use the term?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 143, "span_end": 213, "span_text": ".

A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog probably wants to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your baby away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nLearn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow. Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top.

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. \n\nIn 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". \n\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre.

Take Ben Schlappig. Over his lifetime, he's accrued about four million miles. Half of those, he estimates, were earned on \"mile runs\" -- trips taken for the sole purpose of earning points. \n\nRecently, he completed a dizzying, non-stop trip (London-New York-Los Angeles-Honolulu-Los Angeles-London-Miami-London-Los Angeles-London) that would set most people's heads spinning. It took four days (three of which were spent almost completely on a plane), and he accrued 270,000 miles. \n\nHe admits that the journey was exhausting, but ultimately worth it. \n\n\"To put it into some kind of perspective, it's enough miles for two first-class tickets between the U.S. and Asia,\" he notes. \n\n\"If I would have paid cash for them, they would have each cost me over $20,000.\" \n\nDecember -- which marks the last opportunity for many frequent fliers to earn enough to gain (or maintain) their elite statuses -- is mile-run season.

Under the partnership, CMB will become the first bricks-and-mortar bank that can offer in-app credit card payments to Didi users. At present, users of Didi can only choose third-party payment solutions like WeChat Payment and Alipay to pay cab fares. \n\nZhao Ju, vice-president of CMB, said the cooperation with Didi was an important step in its mobile Internet finance strategy. \"CMB's mobile payment is going to enter a new chapter by leveraging Didi Kuaidi's vast user base,\" he said. \n\nAccording to a report by China Internet Network Information Center earlier this month, Didi holds 87.2 percent of China's private car hailing market. The company said it has received 1.43 billion car-hailing requests on its platforms in 2015, which means 1.43 billion payments were made via smartphones. \n\nCMB is expected to use Didi to reach the core users of China's mobile payment market. Jean Liu, president of Didi, said many of the expats prefer payment by credit card rather than Alipay or WeChat. \"The new partnership will help improve service quality and customer loyalty,\" she said. The investment makes CMB part of Didi's existing investors, including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and China Investment Corporation. Both of the companies declined to reveal the actual amount of the investment. \n\nLiu, who showed up on Tuesday for the first time in public after her treatment for breast cancer, said the cooperation with CMB is for the long run and \"the capital investment is only part of it\". \n\nUnder the partnership, CMB and Didi will cooperate on a wide range of initiatives on financial services and online-to-offline cooperation. Apart from the in-app credit card payments, the two companies are going to launch joint credit cards in late February and automobile financing services for Didi's car owners. CMB's branches across China are expected to help Didi recruit more drivers. \n\n\"There is a lot of room for imagination in our partnership,\" Li said, adding in future people may use their CMB credit card reward points to pay for the ride on Didi. \n\nLi Chao, an analyst with iResearch Consulting Group, said the partnership may not significantly boost CMB's mobile payment business. \"Didi has educated the market for three years and its customers have formed the habit of paying by WeChat or Alipay. So I think CMB can only turn a very smart proportion of Didi users into its payment customer,\" he said. \"But the move shows that China's traditional banking industry is finally thinking out of the box and looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition,\" he said. \n\nStatistics from Big-Data Research showed that more than 90 percent of China's 9.3 trillion yuan ($1.41 trillion) worth of third party mobile payment market is donated by Alibaba and Tencent.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who show up for the 1st time to the public ?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "on what day ?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who teamed up with  Didi Kuaid ?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "give me one reason why ?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "and another reason why ?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who will opffer special credit cards ?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "are they a credit card bussiness ?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what are they ?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what percent of china car hailing do they have ?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how many request ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what kind of request ?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "were payments via computers ?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what were they made via ?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what does cmb stand for ?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what does Li do ?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "with who ?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who provides the stats ?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "who donated payment markets ?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Jean Liu is what ?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "of what company ?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1606, "span_end": 1609, "span_text": "Liu", "input_text": "Liu", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1628, "span_end": 1635, "span_text": "Tuesday", "input_text": "Tuesday", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 27, "span_text": "China Merchants Bank Co Ltd", "input_text": "China Merchants Bank Co Ltd", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 81, "span_end": 110, "span_text": "provide automobile financing ", "input_text": "provide automobile financing", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 114, "span_end": 173, "span_text": "expand its reach in China's booming mobile payment industry", "input_text": "expand its reach in China's booming mobile payment industry", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 315, "span_end": 318, "span_text": "CMB", "input_text": "CMB", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "bank", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "bank", "input_text": "bank", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 879, "span_end": 891, "span_text": "87.2 percent", "input_text": "87.2 percent", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 964, "span_end": 976, "span_text": "1.43 billion", "input_text": "1.43 billion", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 977, "span_end": 997, "span_text": "car-hailing requests", "input_text": "car-hailing requests", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1072, "span_end": 1083, "span_text": "smartphones", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1072, "span_end": 1083, "span_text": "smartphones", "input_text": "smartphones", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 21, "span_text": "China Merchants Bank ", "input_text": "China Merchants Bank", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 2378, "span_end": 2385, "span_text": "analyst", "input_text": "analyst", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 2391, "span_end": 2417, "span_text": "iResearch Consulting Group", "input_text": "iResearch Consulting Group", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2911, "span_end": 2928, "span_text": "Big-Data Research", "input_text": "Big-Data Research", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 3065, "span_end": 3084, "span_text": "Alibaba and Tencent", "input_text": "Alibaba and Tencent", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1183, "span_end": 1192, "span_text": "president", "input_text": "president", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1196, "span_end": 1200, "span_text": "Didi", "input_text": "Didi", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high12938.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3rxpczqmqpbunfy585nmonb8wrxg13", "filename": "middle1592.txt", "story": "Tom gets up at half past seven in the morning.

But what if the drugs don't even work very well? There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years or declined greatly. The reason for this is interesting and even paradoxical. Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene . As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous -- yet many farmers still use them. \n\nTo understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz, a specialist in pig nutrition at Kansas State University. Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, \"people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies,\" he says. Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle. In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers. \n\nFast forward to the 1990s. Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically. \n\nPreviously, pigs were born and raised in one barn or in several barns close together. This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home. Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease. \n\nCraig Rowles, who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. There's not a piglet in sight. \"This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while,\" he says. \n\nA whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. \"That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market,\" Rowles says. \n\nThe groups are kept strictly separated from each other. If workers move between the groups, they first have to change their boots. \n\nWhen farmers adopted multisite production, it cut down on disease -- and pigs actually grew faster.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what are they feeding to the pigs", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what were they used for at first", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 120, "span_end": 165, "span_text": "eeding small amounts of antibiotics to animal", "input_text": "antibiotics", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "high18645.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "31qtrg6q2tdxqy27ndkiwj0a57xyp0", "filename": "FloridaFlorida_ad03588ab9ffdbbbba2c6afe8342704c23bf3befdb3f86f722fdf3c7", "story": "Florida i/\u02c8fl\u0252r\u026ad\u0259/ (Spanish for \"flowery land\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

As of 2014, Russia comprises eighty-five federal subjects, of which four are autonomous okrugs. \n\nOriginally called national okrug, this type of administrative unit was created in the 1920s and widely implemented in 1930 to provide autonomy to indigenous peoples of the North. In 1977, the 1977 Soviet Constitution changed the term \"national okrugs\" to \"autonomous okrugs\" in order to emphasize that they were indeed autonomies and not simply another type of administrative and territorial division.

The onward marches of the British Army were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defense of their homeland. Britain quickly seized control of all of the Orange Free State and Transvaal, as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile. In conventional terms, the war was over.

Development of the handheld was announced during E3 2003, and it was unveiled on , 2004, at a Sony press conference before E3\u00a02004. The system was released in Japan on , 2004, in North America on , 2005, and in the PAL region on , 2005. It primarily competed with the Nintendo DS, as part of the seventh generation of video games consoles. \n\nThe PlayStation Portable became the most powerful portable system when launched, just after the Nintendo DS in 2004. It was the first real competitor to Nintendo's handheld domination, where many challengers, such as SNK's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage, failed. Its GPU encompassed high-end graphics on a handheld, while its 4.3 inch viewing screen and multi-media capabilities, such as its video player and TV tuner, made the PlayStation Portable a major mobile entertainment device at the time. It also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3, other PSPs and the Internet. It is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage medium. \n\nThe original PSP model (PSP-1000) was replaced by a slimmer model with design changes (PSP-2000/\"Slim & Lite\") in 2007. Another remodeling followed in 2008, PSP-3000, which included a new screen and an inbuilt microphone. A complete redesign, PSP Go, came in 2009, followed by a budget model, PSP-E1000, in 2011. The PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita, released in December 2011 in Japan, and in February 2012 worldwide. The PlayStation Vita features backward compatibility with many PlayStation Portable games digitally released on the PlayStation Network, via PlayStation Store.

He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. \n\nMoreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him.

Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid. \n\nThe cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000\u20138,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia. The oldest winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC.[citation needed] By the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes,[citation needed] and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production[citation needed].

The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was rebuilt as the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained an establishment for military education until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. \n\nThe town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the \"Cutty Sark\" and \"Gipsy Moth IV\" next to the river front, and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934.

A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000\u00a0objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet). The Louvre in 2016 was the world's most visited art museum, receiving 7.3 million visitors. \n\nThe museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built as a fortress in the late 12th\u00a0century under Philip\u00a0II. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to the urban expansion of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by Francis I into the main residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.

According to Pantaleo's lawyer, the officer says he didn't use a chokehold on Garner. \n\nThe outpouring started in earnest one week before the New York decision, with the long-awaited announcement of a grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson, Missouri, Police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. That decision was met with violent demonstrations in Ferguson and largely peaceful protests throughout the nation. \n\nOn November 3, five St. Louis Rams players infuriated some people with a silent message before a game against the Oakland Raiders.

II \n\nTHE CHURCH PARADE \n\nIt was raining hard when I climbed into the dog-cart and rattled away into the darkness, while somewhat to my surprise Robert the Devil, or Devilish Bob, as those who had the care of him called the bay horse, played no antics on the outward journey, which was safely accomplished. So leaving him at the venerable \"Swan,\" I hurried through the miry streets toward the church. They were thronged with pale-faced men and women who had sweated out their vigor in the glare of red furnace, dye-shop, and humming mill, but there was no lack of enthusiasm. I do not think there are any cities in the world with the same public spirit and pride in local customs that one may find in the grimy towns of Lancashire. The enthusiasm is, however, part of their inhabitants' nature, and has nothing to do with the dismal surroundings. \n\nA haze of smoke had mingled with the rain; yellow gas jets blinked through it, though it would not be dark for an hour or so yet; and the grim, smoke-blackened houses seemed trickling with water. Still every one laughed and chattered with good-humored expectancy, even the many who had no umbrellas. It was hard work to reach the church, though I opined that all the multitude did not intend to venture within, and when once I saw my uncle with a wand in his hand I carefully avoided him. Martin Lorimer was a power and well liked in that town, but I had not driven ten miles to assist him. Then I waited among the jostling crowd in a fever of impatience, wondering whether Miss Carrington had yet gone in, until at last I saw the Colonel marching through the throng, which--and knowing the temperament of our people I wondered at it--made way for him. There were others of the party behind, and my heart leaped at the sight of Grace. She was walking beside Captain Ormond, who smiled down at her.

These I read to her in such manner as best seemed to fit the high interest of my ends. For Antony, the Roman Triumvir, was now in Asia Minor, and, rumour ran, very wroth because it had been told him that Cleopatra was hostile to the Triumvirate, in that her General, Serapion, had aided Cassius. But Cleopatra protested loudly to me and others that Serapion had acted against her will. Yet Charmion told me that, as with Allienus, it was because of a prophecy of Dioscorides the unlucky that the Queen herself had secretly ordered Serapion so to do. Still, this did not save Serapion, for to prove to Antony that she was innocent she dragged the General from the sanctuary and slew him.

It can uncover laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author of The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to go against the temptation. \n\nBrooks gained fame for several books. His latest book The Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science uncovered about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? \n\nTo answer these questions, Brooks studies a wide range of disciplines . Considering this, you might expect the book to be a simple description of facts. But Brooks has formed his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. \n\nOn the whole, Brooks' story is acceptable if uninspired.

Like you're all giving up on the whole \"revolution\" thing in favor of English-style aristocracy. \n\nSpeculation was reignited -- one suspects entirely by accident -- when George P. Bush told ABC that his father is \"giving [the presidency] serious thought and moving ... forward.\" I've heard the opposite, that the candidate hasn't quite got the requisite enthusiasm.

By the end of the nineteenth century, it had formed four governments under William Gladstone. Despite splitting over the issue of Irish Home Rule, the party returned to power in 1906 with a landslide victory. \n\nIt passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state. H. H. Asquith was Liberal Prime Minister between 1908 and 1916, followed by David Lloyd George, 1916-22. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant figure was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in late 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process. Historian Martin Pugh in \"The Oxford Companion to British History\" argues that Lloyd George: \n\nThe Lloyd George coalition was dominated by the Conservative Party, which finally deposed him in 1922. By the end of the 1920s, the Labour Party had replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rival. The party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections. Apart from notable by-election victories, the party's fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance with the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. At the 1983 General Election, the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested. At the 1987 General Election, its vote fell below 23% and the Liberal and Social Democratic parties merged in 1988 to form the Liberal Democrats.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What system of values is the U.S dollar based upon?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is the value of an eagle in the U.S monetary system?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "In circulating for what are denominations less than a dollar issued as?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was the coin known as the double eagle discontinued?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What are mils sometimes used for?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Has any $100 dollar coin knows as the Union ever been issued?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who suggested  creating $100, $50, $25 gold coins in 1954?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is the value of a Dime coin?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is paper currency less than one dollar sometimes called?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Are the Union and the mill known well to the general public?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 65, "span_end": 80, "span_text": "decimal system ", "input_text": "decimal system", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 301, "span_end": 322, "span_text": " eagle or ten dollars", "input_text": "ten dollars", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 564, "span_end": 630, "span_text": "However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar", "input_text": "cents", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1575, "span_end": 1601, "span_text": " discontinued in the 1930s", "input_text": "1930s", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 769, "span_end": 825, "span_text": "though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies", "input_text": "tax levies", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1888, "span_end": 2046, "span_text": "In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and", "input_text": "James Guthrie in 1854", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 633, "span_end": 699, "span_text": "dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2", "input_text": "10\u00a2", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1792, "span_end": 1822, "span_text": " known as \"fractional currency", "input_text": "fractional currency", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 480, "span_end": 768, "span_text": "but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist.

He could not retire to rest. He called Essper George, and gave him all necessary directions for the morning. About three o'clock Vivian lay down on a sofa, and slept for a few hours. He started often in his short and feverish slumber. His dreams were unceasing and inexplicable. At first von Sohnspeer was their natural hero; but soon the scene shifted. Vivian was at Ems, walking under the well-remembered lime-trees, and with the Baroness. Suddenly, although it was mid-day, the Sun became large, blood-red, and fell out of the heavens; his companion screamed, a man rushed forward with a drawn sword. It was the idiot Crown Prince of Reisenburg. Vivian tried to oppose him, but without success. The infuriated ruffian sheathed his weapon in the heart of the Baroness. Vivian shrieked, and fell upon her body, and, to his horror, found himself embracing the cold corpse of Violet Fane! \n\nVivian and Essper mounted their horses about seven o'clock. At eight they had reached a small inn near the Forest Councillor's house, where Vivian was to remain until Essper had watched the entrance of the Minister. It was a few minutes past nine when Essper returned with the joyful intelligence that Owlface and his master had been seen to enter the Courtyard. Vivian immediately mounted Max, and telling Essper to keep a sharp watch, he set spurs to his horse. \n\n\"Now, Max, my good steed, each minute is golden; serve thy master well!\" He patted the horse's neck, the animal's erected ears proved how well it understood its master's wishes; and taking advantage of the loose bridle, which was confidently allowed it, the horse sprang rather than galloped to the Minister's residence. Nearly an hour, however, was lost in gaining the private road, for Vivian, after the caution in the Baroness's letter, did not dare the high road.

It is the only major European city to have a mosque, Catholic church, Orthodox church and synagogue within the same neighborhood.

The villa at Highgate--called Ten Acres Lodge, in allusion to the measurement of the grounds surrounding the house--had been kept in perfect order by the servants of the late Lady Berrick, now in the employment of her nephew. \n\nOn the morning after their arrival at the villa, Stella sent a note to her mother. The same afternoon, Mrs. Eyrecourt arrived at Ten Acres--on her way to a garden-party. Finding the house, to her great relief, a modern building, supplied with all the newest comforts and luxuries, she at once began to plan a grand party, in celebration of the return of the bride and bridegroom. \n\n\"I don't wish to praise myself,\" Mrs. Eyrecourt said; \"but if ever there was a forgiving woman, I am that person. We will say no more, Stella, about your truly contemptible wedding--five people altogether, including ourselves and the Lorings. A grand ball will set you right with society, and that is the one thing needful. Tea and coffee, my dear Romayne, in your study; Coote's quadrille band; the supper from Gunter's, the grounds illuminated with colored lamps; Tyrolese singers among the trees, relieved by military music--and, if there _are_ any African or other savages now in London, there is room enough in these charming grounds for encampments, dances, squaws, scalps, and all the rest of it, to end in a blaze of fireworks.\" \n\nA sudden fit of coughing seized her, and stopped the further enumeration of attractions at the contemplated ball.

She also disappointed some feminists who wanted her to defend their causes instead of falling back on her self-described role as the nation's \"mom-in-chief.\" Nor did she handle racial issues during her second term, as some had expected. \n\n\"The most important thing to remember is, whether you are black, white or Hispanic, you're the first lady and the president of all the people in the United States.

Michelle launched the \"Let's Move\" campaign in 2010.

Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago. \n\nNow, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008. \n\nNot all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don't meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school. \n\nFor small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running. \n\nBut for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. \"They're trying to buy students,\" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum. \n\nStudies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it. \n\n\"As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,\" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17. \n\nMerit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, \"served us well,\" Inzer says, but \"to be discounting the price for families that don't need financial aid doesn't feel right any more.\" \n\nNeed-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level. \n\nBetween 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state's public institutions. \n\nBut in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be \"a sign that people are starting to realize that there's this destructive competition going on,\" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need. \n\nDavid Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors. \n\n\"No one can take one-sided action,\" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, \"This is a merry-go-round that's going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.\" \n\nA complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don't qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs. \n\nThat's one reason Allegheny College doesn't plan to drop merit aid entirely. \n\n\"We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,\" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny's vice president for enrollment. \n\nEmory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program. \n\n\"Yeah, we're playing the merit game,\" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. \"The fact of the matter is, it's not just about the lowest-income people. It's the average American middle-class family who's being priced out of the market.\" \n\nA few words about merit-based aid: \n\nMerit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships. \n\nAcademic merit scholarships are based on students' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. \n\nAthletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee . Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance. \n\nArtistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing.

It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four \"goals of life\" or \"puru\u1e63\u0101rtha\" (12.161). Among the principal works and stories in the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" are the \"Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101\", the story of Damayant\u012b, an abbreviated version of the \"R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\", and the story of \u1e5a\u1e63yasringa, often considered as works in their own right. \n\nTraditionally, the authorship of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is attributed to Vy\u0101sa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The oldest preserved parts of the text are thought to be not much older than around 400\u00a0BCE, though the origins of the epic probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century CE). The title may be translated as \"the great tale of the Bh\u0101rata dynasty\". According to the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply \"Bh\u0101rata\". \n\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is the longest epic poem known and has been described as \"the longest poem ever written\". Its longest version consists of over 100,000 \"\u015bloka\" or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8\u00a0million words in total, the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is roughly ten times the length of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" combined, or about four times the length of the \"R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\".

Ronald Leslie grew up a sturdy lad, full of fun and mischief in spite of the sober atmosphere of the bailie's house; and neither flogging at school nor lecturing at home appeared to have the slightest effect in reducing him to that state of sober tranquillity which was in Mrs. Anderson's eyes the thing to be most desired in boys. Andrew was less deeply shocked than his wife at the discovery of Ronald's various delinquencies, but his sense of order and punctuality was constantly outraged. He was, however, really fond of the lad; and even Mrs. Anderson, greatly as the boy's ways constantly disturbed and ruffled her, was at heart as fond of him as was her husband. She considered, and not altogether wrongly, that his wilderness, as she called it, was in no slight degree due to his association with her husband's brother. \n\nRonald looked forward to the periodical visits of the drover with intense longing. He was sure of a sympathetic listener in Malcolm, who listened with approval to the tales of the various scrapes into which he had got since his last visit; of how, instead of going to school, he had played truant and with another boy his own age had embarked in a fisherman's boat and gone down the river and had not been able to get back until next day; how he had played tricks upon his dominie, and had conquered in single combat the son of Councillor Duff, the butcher, who had spoken scoffing words at the Stuarts. Malcolm was, in fact, delighted to find, that in spite of repression and lectures his young charge was growing up a lad of spirit.

He's getting kids engaged at his World Science Festival. He has even written a children's book based on relativity, \"Icarus at the Edge of Time.\" \n\nIcarus was the boy in the ancient Greek myth whose father crafted him wings of wax. The father warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun. Icarus ignored him. His wax wings melted, and he died. \n\nGreene's reincarnation of Icarus was born on a space ship -- part of a community of explorers on a 25-trillion mile search for life on another planet. He is 14, which gets my attention, because it's about the same age as my oldest daughter. \n\nThe length of the spaceship's journey means Icarus must live his whole life within the confines of that ship. \"But,\" writes Brian Greene, the boy \"had a palpable yearning for something beyond the life he'd been handed.\" One day the ship's captain, Icarus' father, announces: \"We are making an emergency course diversion to avoid an uncharted black hole.\" \n\nIcarus has built his own small spacecraft. He has done the calculations. He ignores his father's warning. He sets out to approach the black hole, to get within \"a hairsbreadth above the point of no return.\" \n\nHe miscalculates ever so slightly and is thrust 10,000 years into the future. He is found by a new generation and is briefed on the long history he just missed, including the fact that the universe was now, as a result of the mission his father commanded, in an era of interstellar cooperation and lasting peace.

The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division. Busch Stadium has been their home ballpark since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881, then known as the Brown Stockings, and established them as charter members of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900. \n\nOne of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships, the second-most in Major League Baseball and most in the National League.

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

Dave felt something hit him on the bottom of his left cheek and putting up his hand withdrew it covered with blood. Henry, too, was hit by a flying fragment of the gun barrel which clipped off a lock of his hair. Poor Barringford lay like one dead. \n\nBefore Dave could recover the Indians were on them, whooping as if their very lives depended upon it. One threw a tomahawk at Dave, but the aim was poor and the weapon buried itself in the log which had sheltered our friends. \n\nBut just at this moment, when all seemed lost, the battleground shifted and instantly thirty or forty English red-coats burst from the woods directly behind the Indians. A volley rang out and four of the redmen pitched forward, shot through the back. Other bullets hit the log behind which our friends lay, but Dave, Henry, and Barringford were not touched. \n\nAttacked so unexpectedly from a new quarter, the Indians appeared dazed. They attempted to turn upon the English soldiers, but when two more were laid low, they fled to one side, where there was a dense growth of walnuts.

It wasn't easy getting hired. But once you were there, I found, you were in. \n\nGlobe jobs were for life-guaranteed until retirement. For 15 years I had prospered there--moving from an ordinary reporter to senior editor. I would have a lifetime of security if I stuck with it. Instead, I had made a decision to leave. I entered my boss's office. Would he be angry? I wondered. He had a famous temper. \"Matt, we have to have a talk,\" I began. \"I came to the Globe when I was twenty-four. Now I' m forty. There' s a lot I want to do in life. I'm resigning. \" \"To another paper?\" he asked. I reached into my coat pocket, but didn't say anything. I handed him a letter that explained everything. It said that I was leaving to start a new media company. We were at a rare turning point in history. I wanted to be directly engaged in the change. \"I' m glad for you,\" he said, quite out of my expectation. \"I just came from a board of directors meeting and it was seventy-five percent discouraging news. Some of that we can deal with. But much of it we can' t,\" he went on. \"I wish you all the luck in the world,\" he concluded. \"And if it doesn't work out, remember, there is always a place here for you.\" \n\nThen I went out of his office, walking through the newsroom for more good-byes. Everybody was saying congratulations. Everybody--even though I'd be risking all the financial security I had carefully built up. \n\nLater, I had a final talk with Bill Taylor, chairman and publisher of the Boston Globe. He had turned the Globe into a billion-dollar property. \"I' m resigning, Bill,\" I said. He listened while I gave him the story. He wasn't looking angry either.
