This year the staff of the Grammar-School was invited, along with the chief officials of the firm. Gerald and the younger Criches did not care for this party, but it had become customary now, and it pleased the father, as being the only occasion when he could gather some people of the district together in festivity with him. For he loved to give pleasures to his dependents and to those poorer than himself. But his children preferred the company of their own equals in wealth. They hated their inferiors' humility or gratitude or awkwardness. \n\nNevertheless they were willing to attend at this festival, as they had done almost since they were children, the more so, as they all felt a little guilty now, and unwilling to thwart their father any more, since he was so ill in health. Therefore, quite cheerfully Laura prepared to take her mother's place as hostess, and Gerald assumed responsibility for the amusements on the water. \n\nBirkin had written to Ursula saying he expected to see her at the party, and Gudrun, although she scorned the patronage of the Criches, would nevertheless accompany her mother and father if the weather were fine.

It was April, and White Fang was a year old when he pulled into the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah. Though a long way from his full growth, White Fang, next to Lip-lip, was the largest yearling in the village. Both from his father, the wolf, and from Kiche, he had inherited stature and strength, and already he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs. But he had not yet grown compact. His body was slender and rangy, and his strength more stringy than massive, His coat was the true wolf-grey, and to all appearances he was true wolf himself. The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically, though it had played its part in his mental make-up. \n\nHe wandered through the village, recognising with staid satisfaction the various gods he had known before the long journey. Then there were the dogs, puppies growing up like himself, and grown dogs that did not look so large and formidable as the memory pictures he retained of them. Also, he stood less in fear of them than formerly, stalking among them with a certain careless ease that was as new to him as it was enjoyable. \n\nThere was Baseek, a grizzled old fellow that in his younger days had but to uncover his fangs to send White Fang cringing and crouching to the right about. From him White Fang had learned much of his own insignificance; and from him he was now to learn much of the change and development that had taken place in himself. While Baseek had been growing weaker with age, White Fang had been growing stronger with youth.

Fourteen \n\nThe Frozen Heart \n\nIn the hut of Pon, the gardener's boy, Button-Bright was the first to waken in the morning. Leaving his companions still asleep, he went out into the fresh morning air and saw some blackberries growing on bushes in a field not far away. Going to the bushes he found the berries ripe and sweet, so he began eating them. More bushes were scattered over the fields, so the boy wandered on, from bush to bush, without paying any heed to where he was wandering. Then a butterfly fluttered by. He gave chase to it and followed it a long way. When finally he paused to look around him, Button-Bright could see no sign of Pon's house, nor had he the slightest idea in which direction it lay. \n\n\"Well, I'm lost again,\" he remarked to himself. \"But never mind; I've been lost lots of times. Someone is sure to find me.\" \n\nTrot was a little worried about Button-Bright when she awoke and found him gone. Knowing how careless he was, she believed that he had strayed away, but felt that he would come back in time, because he had a habit of not staying lost. Pon got the little girl some food for her breakfast and then together they went out of the hut and stood in the sunshine. \n\nPon's house was some distance off the road, but they could see it from where they stood and both gave a start of surprise when they discovered two soldiers walking along the roadway and escorting Princess Gloria between them. The poor girl had her hands bound together, to prevent her from struggling, and the soldiers rudely dragged her forward when her steps seemed to lag.

Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \"angiosperm\" comes from the Greek composite word (angeion-, \"case\" or \"casing\", and sperma, \"seed\") meaning \"enclosed seeds\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. \n\nFossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years. Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that \"swim\" down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are the most diverse group of land plants?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many different types of them are there?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What do they create?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What differentiates them from gymnosperms?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What edible things do they create?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How long have they been on Earth?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What other plant-like thing helped them evolve?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is that considered?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the thing that was created after all the evolution?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did the first ones not create?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What are some examples of those?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 4, "span_end": 34, "span_text": "flowering plants (angiosperms)", "input_text": "flowering plants (angiosperms)", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 135, "span_end": 142, "span_text": "350,000", "input_text": "350,000", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 186, "span_end": 190, "span_text": "seed", "input_text": "seeds", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 278, "span_end": 286, "span_text": "flowers,", "input_text": "flowers,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 468, "span_end": 482, "span_text": "fruiting plant", "input_text": "fruit", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 747, "span_end": 773, "span_text": "at least 475 million years", "input_text": "at least 475 million years", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 856, "span_end": 867, "span_text": "green algae", "input_text": "green algae", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 831, "span_end": 845, "span_text": "swimming sperm", "input_text": "swimming sperm", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1589, "span_end": 1598, "span_text": " the seed", "input_text": "the seed", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1703, "span_end": 1710, "span_text": "flowers", "input_text": "flowers", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1636, "span_end": 1660, "span_text": "the ginkgo, and conifers", "input_text": "the ginkgo, and conifer plants", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Flowering_plantFlowering_plant_f34e81bed6e2b8ab43e58882ea78964bae1224214c16f2d2e8e35268"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3ywrv122cszv3xjlrvli7cz7kfiu8m", "filename": "cnn_9f9bfb058743de9325bd06dd401cfec5cf7b8352.story", "story": "(CNN) -- A Michigan teenager pleaded guilty Monday in the mob beating of a 54-year-old grandfather after he inadvertently struck a child with his truck in April, according to a news release from the Wayne County Prosecutor's office. \n\nBruce Wimbush, 18, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to do great bodily harm, according to the news release. \n\nWimbush admitted in court Monday that he punched the driver, Steven Utash, in the jaw and was among a \"large group of people\" that attacked the man in April.

Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury, is the nucleus of the old town. From the 1930s when de Havilland opened a factory until the 1990s when British Aerospace closed, Hatfield was associated with aircraft design and manufacture, which employed more people than any other industry. \n\nHatfield was one of the post-war New Towns built around London and has much modernist architecture from the period. The University of Hertfordshire is based there. Hatfield is north of London and is connected to the capital via the A1(M) and direct trains to London King's Cross, Finsbury Park and Moorgate. As a result, the town has seen a recent increase in commuters who work in London moving to the area. \n\nIn the Saxon period Hatfield was known as Hetfelle, but by the year 970, when King Edgar gave to the monastery of Ely, it had become known as Haethfeld. Hatfield is mentioned in the Domesday Book as the property of the Abbey of Ely, and unusually, the original census data which compilers of Domesday used still survives, giving us slightly more information than in the final Domesday record. No other records remain until 1226, when Henry III granted the Bishops of Ely rights to an annual four-day fair and a weekly market.

The results of that explosion are what we call the universe. \n\nHawking has always tried to make science more popular with people. His book: A Brief History of Time was published in 1988. In the book he shares his understanding of the universe in simple language. The book tries to explain many subjects about the universe to common readers, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones . \n\nHawking's achievements are even greater if you think about his disability. When he was 21, Hawking caught a bad illness that slowly stopped him from moving or talking. Now he sits on a wheelchair with a computer by his side. To communicate, he moves two fingers to control the computer's mouse. He chooses his words from the screen, which are then spoken by a voice synthesizer . \n\nHawking also believes that there might be aliens in space.

One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range. \n\nThe largest city and principal economic and financial center is Santa Cruz de la Sierra, located on the Llanos Orientales (Tropical lowlands) mostly flat region in the East of Bolivia.

Spanish \"conquistadors\" arriving from Cuzco and Asunci\u00f3n took control of the region in the 16th century. During the Spanish colonial period Bolivia was administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas.

Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as \"sterile\" and said he dreaded living in the \"small town\" of Albany, if elected. That didn't play well in rural areas. \n\nNow comes Colin Powell.

Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour and sprawls about on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north and Macarthur to the south. Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions. Residents of the city are known as \"Sydneysiders\". As at June 2016 Sydney's estimated population was 5,029,768. \n\nThe Sydney area has been inhabited by indigenous Australians for at least 30,000 years. Lieutenant James Cook first landed at Kurnell in 1770, when navigating his way up the east coast of Australia on his ship, \"HMS Endeavour\". It was not until 1788 when the \"First Fleet\", which contained convicts and was led by Captain Arthur Phillip, arrived in Botany Bay to found Sydney as a penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. Phillip named the city \"Sydney\" in recognition of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, Home Secretary in 1788. There are examples of rock art and engravings located in the protected Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, as well as the Royal National Park. \n\nSince convict transportation ended in the mid-19th century, the city has transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre. The municipal council of Sydney was incorporated in 1842 and became Australia's first city. Gold was discovered in the colony in 1851 and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money. Sydney became one of the most multicultural cities in the world after the mass migration following the second World War.

Fukuda is now one of only four living people who have earned the tenth-degree black belt. Throughout history, only 16 people have ever achieved this honor.

During a time when getting married, building a family and becoming a housewife were the norms ,Fukuda broke from tradition, continuing Judo instead of getting married. \"All I did was Judo ... This was my marriage,\" Fukuda replied tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This is when my destiny was set. I just imagined how long the road would be.\" She described the Jiguro's school as \"old-fashioned and sexist about belts and ranks\". In fact, an edict that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for 30 years. She finally got the sixth degree in 1972 when a women's division was created. Fukuda thinks Judo and her life to be \"gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically\".

Neither in his clothes nor personal appearance was there any striking difference between him and the crowd of other young men who thronged the rooms, except perhaps that he was a trifle better made, and pleasanter to look at than most of them, and that the air of boredom, so apparent on most of their faces and in their manners, was in his case perfectly natural. As a matter of fact, he hated afternoon receptions, and was only waiting for a favourable opportunity to make his exit unnoticed. \n\n\"Paul, my boy, you don't look happy,\" exclaimed a voice in his ear. \n\nPaul de Vaux turned upon the new-comer sharply. \"Not likely to, Arthur.

"CHAPTER XXIII. \n\nTHE TOWN ORDINANCE. \n\nThe news which Dick carried to Sawyer was sufficient to create a great excitement in that naturally quiet little town. In addition to what looked like an attempted murder, was the fact that George Harnett, whom they had all respected before the conflagration, and admired after it, was the intended victim. \n\nThere was no need for Dick to urge that officers be sent to try to effect the capture of the scoundrels, for almost before he had finished telling the story, a large party of citizens started in search of the men, determined that they should answer for their crime. \n\nTherefore, when Dick returned, it was with so large a following that the physicians rushed out in the greatest haste to insist on their keeping at a respectful distance from the house, lest the noise might affect their patient. \n\nBob and his partners were anxious to join in the search, and urged Ralph to accompany them, since he could do no good to George by remaining; but he refused to leave his friend, even though he could not aid him, and the party started without him, a look of determination on their faces that boded no good to the professed oil prospectors in case they should be caught. \n\nDuring all of that night Ralph remained with George, listening to his delirious ravings, as he supposed he was still battling for his life with the men, and just at daybreak Bob returned alone. The search had been even more successful than any of the party had dared to hope for when they set out, for the men had been captured in the woods about four miles from the place where the assault had been made and in the pocket of one of them was the paper from which one corner had been left in George's hand.

Viewers have had to wait a long time since A Bite of China 1 came out in 2012.

A famous foreigner praised it, saying \"it's the best TV show I've ever seen about food. I'm sure it's the best one ever made. \" The new season includes eight episodes, covering 300 types of food. According to CCTV, every minute of the show was edited out of 150 minutes of footage . Finding their subjects was often the hardest part of the film team's job. It took them six months to film a beekeeping couple , which included a journey of more than 2,000 kilometers. Food is a personal thing, in that no dish suits all tastes. However, the program has still managed to move all sorts of viewers. \"Compared with A Bite of China 1, the new season has a more human touch, which makes viewers cover some tears while their mouths are watering,\" said Sina Entertainment. As always, the people are the most interesting part.

She was cut off from everything she belonged to. Ovid isolated in Thrace might well lament. The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment. This nourishment lacking, nothing is well. \n\nAt Pescocalascio it was the mysterious influence of the mountains and valleys themselves which seemed always to be annihilating the Englishwoman: nay, not only her, but the very natives themselves. Ciccio and Pancrazio clung to her, essentially, as if she saved them also from extinction. It needed all her courage. Truly, she had to support the souls of the two men. \n\nAt first she did not realize. She was only stunned with the strangeness of it all: startled, half-enraptured with the terrific beauty of the place, half-horrified by its savage annihilation of her. But she was stunned. The days went by. \n\nIt seems there are places which resist us, which have the power to overthrow our psychic being. It seems as if every country has its potent negative centres, localities which savagely and triumphantly refuse our living culture. And Alvina had struck one of them, here on the edge of the Abruzzi. \n\nShe was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself. That was a long hour's walk away. Pancrazio's house was the chief of a tiny hamlet of three houses, called Califano because the Califanos had made it. There was the ancient, savage hole of a house, quite windowless, where Pancrazio and Ciccio's mother had been born: the family home. Then there was Pancrazio's villa. And then, a little below, another newish, modern house in a sort of wild meadow, inhabited by the peasants who worked the land. Ten minutes' walk away was another cluster of seven or eight houses, where Giovanni lived. But there was no shop, no post nearer than Pescocalascio, an hour's heavy road up deep and rocky, wearying tracks.

Frank looked in, and saw that it had clean gravel walks and beautiful flowers. \n\nHe called to his mother and said, \"Mum, come and look at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and walk in.\" \n\nThe gardener heard what Frank said, and kindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden. \n\nFrank's mother thanked the man. Then she said to her son, \"Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you must take care not to meddle with anything in it.\" \n\nFrank walked along the tidy gravel walks, and looked at everything, but touched nothing that he saw. \n\nHe did not step on any of the borders , and was careful that his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers so that he might not break them. \n\nThe gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he was so careful to behave well. He showed him the seeds, and told him the name of many of the flowers and plants. \n\nWhile Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a little boy came to the gate, and finding it locked. He shook it hard, but it would not open. Then he said, \"Let me in. Let me in. Will you not let me in this garden?\" \n\n\"No,\" said the gardener, \"1 will not let you in, Tom.

And this to her was one of the most wonderful things in her affliction. It had come and crushed her, and life still went on much as before. The sun of her system had fallen, and yet the system was not appreciably deranged. It was dreadful to her to think that Arthur was dead, but an added sting lay in the fact that she was not dead too. Oh! how glad she would have been to die, since death had become the gate through which she needs must pass to reach her lover's side. \n\nFor it had been given to Angela, living so much alone, and thinking so long and deeply upon these great mysteries of our being, to soar to the heights of a noble faith. To the intense purity of her mind, a living heaven presented itself, a comfortable place, very different from the vague and formularised abstractions with which we are for the most part satisfied; where Arthur and her mother were waiting to greet her, and where the great light of the Godhead would shine around them all. She grew to hate her life, the dull barrier of the flesh that stood between her and her ends.

Jon Beck, 61, and Chuck Merrill, 72, bought the now-vintage vehicle in Idahoafter placing an ad in a local newspaper to buy a classic car in need of restoration. Driving the car home after buying it, the collectors stopped at a restaurant and saw something from below the back seat. \"Like a couple of kids, we thought we had a goldmine,\" Mr. Beck said. Instead, they found some small change -- the leather wallet held a $10 bill, Mr. Goodlove's military ID, his social security card, his driver's license and several jewellery receipts from 1952. But they were all in the name of Glenn Putnam. After searching online, Mr. Beck discovered that Mr. Putnam had since changed his name to Glenn Goodlove and moved to San Diego,California. He called Mr. Goodlove, asking to speak to a man who used to drive a '46Hudson. \"There was a silence for about 15 seconds,\" Mr. Beck told the Twin Falls Times-News. \"Then he said, 'Who is that?'\" Mr. Goodlove, now 75, says he did not even remember losing the wallet, but the find has brought memories of his youth inEverett,Washington, flooding back. \"I could see the house and the car and the town and all the good stuff from living there,\" he said. \"They've been flowing ever since he talked to me.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What item was recovered?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who did it belong to?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was that the same name listed in the missing item?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was the other one?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who retrieved the missing item?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where was the item found?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Of what?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was this person attempting to do with the vehicle?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What had he done before running it home?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many others were with him?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who was he?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What were there plans with the vehicle?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When they retrieved the missing item, was there a couple hundred dollars in it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How much did they discover?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How old is the original owner?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 64, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "wallet", "input_text": "wallet", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 224, "span_text": "Glenn Goodlove", "input_text": "Glenn Goodlove", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 970, "span_end": 982, "span_text": "Glenn Putnam", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 970, "span_end": 982, "span_text": "Glenn Putnam", "input_text": "Glenn Putnam", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 390, "span_end": 398, "span_text": "Jon Beck", "input_text": "Jon Beck", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 652, "span_end": 671, "span_text": "below the back seat", "input_text": "below the back seat", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 296, "span_end": 324, "span_text": "1946 prefix = st1 /Hudsoncar", "input_text": "1946 prefix = st1 /Hudsoncar", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 552, "span_end": 572, "span_text": "Driving the car home", "input_text": "Drive the car home", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 605, "span_end": 628, "span_text": "stopped at a restaurant", "input_text": "stopped at a restaurant", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 408, "span_end": 421, "span_text": "Chuck Merrill", "input_text": "One", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 421, "span_text": " Chuck Merrill", "input_text": "Chuck Merrill", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 539, "span_end": 550, "span_text": "restoration", "input_text": "restoration", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 818, "span_text": " $10 bill", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 818, "span_text": " $10 bill", "input_text": "$10 bill", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1337, "span_end": 1340, "span_text": " 75", "input_text": "75", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "high16615.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3ymtujh0dsgfkjhufn5vl4x0zhf4t2", "filename": "The_New_Zealand_Herald.txt", "story": "The New Zealand Herald is a daily newspaper published in Auckland, New Zealand, owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment.

He is accused of violating the human rights of four people. \n\nThere are 31 defendants in the two trials, the Judicial Information Center said on its website Tuesday. \n\nAnother former dictator, Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, was sentenced in April to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. He ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. \n\nBignone, 82, faces two other trials: in the abduction and disappearance of doctors and nurses at the Hospital Posada and of two soldiers when he was head of the Military College. \n\nUp to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year \"Dirty War.\" \n\nIn the trials that start this week, the proceedings for Menendez are slated to begin Thursday in the city of Mendoza. Six other defendants will go on trial with him. \n\nThe trial against former dictator Videla is scheduled to start Friday in Cordoba. He will be joined by 24 other defendants, the Judicial Information Center said.

But what if the drugs don't even work very well? There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years or declined greatly. The reason for this is interesting and even paradoxical. Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene . As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous -- yet many farmers still use them. \n\nTo understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz, a specialist in pig nutrition at Kansas State University. Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, \"people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies,\" he says. Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle. In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers. \n\nFast forward to the 1990s. Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically. \n\nPreviously, pigs were born and raised in one barn or in several barns close together. This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home. Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease. \n\nCraig Rowles, who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. There's not a piglet in sight. \"This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while,\" he says. \n\nA whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. \"That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market,\" Rowles says. \n\nThe groups are kept strictly separated from each other.

Rod Blagojevich was found guilty Tuesday of making false statements to the FBI, but escaped convictions on 23 other counts in a trial that is seen as at least a partial victory for Blagojevich. \n\nThe jury, which deliberated for 14 days, said it was hung on 23 counts against him and on the counts against the former governor's brother, Robert Blagojevich. \n\nThe former governor faced charges including racketeering, wire fraud, attempted extortion and bribery. A two-term Democrat, he was removed from office in January 2009 amid accusations that he attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat that had been occupied by Barack Obama before Obama was elected president. \n\n\"On every charge except for one, they could not prove that I did anything wrong,\" said Rod Blagojevich, shorty after the jury was dismissed. \"I told the truth from the very beginning.\" \n\nHe added he would appeal the one conviction and thanked members of the jury for finding what they did. \n\nThe next court date in the case is set for August 26, though prosecutors said they will try the former governor again. \n\nThe maximum penalty for making false statements is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \n\nConviction on the counts of wire fraud, racketeering and attempted extortion would have carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, while a conviction on the count of solicitation of bribery would have had a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000.

It was also an early colonial power, with possessions around the world. \n\nFrance originated as West Francia (\"Francia Occidentalis\"), the western half of the Carolingian Empire, with the Treaty of Verdun (843). A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987, when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty. The territory remained known as \"Francia\" and its ruler as \"rex Francorum\" (\"king of the Franks\") well into the High Middle Ages. The first king calling himself \"Roi de France\" (\"King of France\") was Philip II, in 1190. France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines\u2014the Valois and Bourbon\u2014until the monarchy was overthrown in 1792 during the French Revolution. \n\nFrance in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised, feudal monarchy. In Brittany and Catalonia (now a part of Spain) the authority of the French king was barely felt. Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France. Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, which became codified in the Salic law. During the Late Middle Ages, the Kings of England laid claim to the French throne, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453).

The country geographically comprises two main landmasses\u2014the North Island (or \"Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui\"), and the South Island (or \"Te Waipounamu\")\u2014and around 600 smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. \n\nSometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture. In 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of Britain and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a Dominion.

She's been called \"beautiful,\" \"hot\" and \"sexy\" but when it comes to tennis, the most apt description for Maria Sharapova has to be \"tough.\" \n\nThe Russian rallied from a set down three straight times to reach this year's French Open final and then prevailed in Saturday's thrilling three-hour finale against rising star Simona Halep, 6-4 6-7 6-4. \n\n\"This is the toughest grand slam final I've ever played,\" Sharapova, who was contesting a ninth such match, summed up as she collected her trophy. \n\nEven after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults, Sharapova still had the edge. \n\nShe's almost a sure thing in third sets on clay, having triumphed 20 times in a row. It's been six years since the 27-year-old was defeated after capturing the first set in a clay-court match, too. \n\nBut if Halep maintains this form, it won't be long before she opens her grand slam account. \n\nSmaller and with less power than Sharapova, the Romanian nonetheless almost did the unthinkable -- toughing out the now five-time grand slam champion. Her manager, Virginia Ruzici, remains the last Romanian to win a grand slam, in Paris in 1978. \n\nSharapova famously uttered in 2007 that she felt like a \"cow on ice\" playing on clay but the French Open has now become her most productive grand slam -- it's the only one she's won more than once and it's the only one she's won after two serious shoulder injuries in 2008 and 2013.

Every year, Tara Atkins-Smith collects warm clothes from her community in order to help the less lucky. This year, since the family was traveling to Halifax with their daughter Jayda and seven of her friends to celebrate her 8thbirthday Tara thought it was the perfect time to teach the chidren a valuable life lesson. The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles for others to pick up. Each of the clothes had a tag that read, \"I am not lost. If you are caught in the cold, please take me to keep warm. \" According to Tara, the experience helped the children better understand the difficult situation of homeless people, who have to brave the cold winter on the streets. \"When we got back in the car after an hour on the street, they were all freezing cold and crying for the heater to be on because they were cold , \" she said. By next morning, all the jackets, gloves, and scarves on the poles were gone. Photos of the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook, and have got over10,000 likes. Tara, who did something similar in Toronto in December last year, says she's already planning next year's coat drive. She hopes that the meaningful thing can spread around the world, and she also wants to add $5 fast food gift card so that the homeless people can also enjoy a hot meal. \"We've got help from others when we were in need, and we knew how great it made us feel,\" said Zackary Atkins, Tara's husband.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is spreading Christmas spirit?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "HOw did they do it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was this a normal thing?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did the locals do?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "and did what with them?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does Tara usually do?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did she think it was a perfect time to do?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did they hand them all out?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did they do with the rest?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is she planning on doing this again?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "when?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was this event shared?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "on what?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "did anyone share it?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "how many times", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "any likes?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "how many?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What happened in Toronto?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 22, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "A group of Canadian kids are spreading a bit of Christmas spirit", "input_text": "a group of Canadian kids", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 111, "span_end": 205, "span_text": " by covering warm clothes around light poles for the city's homeless people to pick up and use", "input_text": "by giving warm clothes for the homeless", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 112, "span_end": 155, "span_text": "by covering warm clothes around light poles", "input_text": "by leaving warm clothes around light poles", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 209, "span_end": 234, "span_text": "was such an unusual sight", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 240, "span_end": 271, "span_text": "locals stopped to take pictures", "input_text": "took pictures", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 258, "span_end": 296, "span_text": "take pictures to share on social media", "input_text": "to share on social media", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 369, "span_text": "Tara Atkins-Smith collects warm clothes from her community", "input_text": "she collects warm clothes from her community", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 536, "span_end": 616, "span_text": "Tara thought it was the perfect time to teach the chidren a valuable life lesson", "input_text": "to teach her children a valuable life lesson", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 618, "span_end": 671, "span_text": "The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless", "input_text": "by having them hand out coats to the homeless", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 638, "span_end": 708, "span_text": "handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 676, "span_end": 708, "span_text": "tied the rest around light poles", "input_text": "tied them around light poles", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1437, "span_end": 1482, "span_text": "she's already planning next year's coat drive", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1437, "span_end": 1480, "span_text": "she's already planning next year's coat dri", "input_text": "next year", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1263, "span_end": 1333, "span_text": "the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1296, "span_end": 1333, "span_text": "shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook", "input_text": "on Facebook", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1286, "span_end": 1321, "span_text": "have been shared about 8, 000 times", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1296, "span_end": 1321, "span_text": "shared about 8, 000 times", "input_text": "about 8, 000 times", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1339, "span_end": 1364, "span_text": "have got over10,000 likes", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1348, "span_end": 1364, "span_text": "over10,000 likes", "input_text": "over 10,000", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1366, "span_end": 1430, "span_text": "Tara, who did something similar in Toronto in December last year", "input_text": "something similar to what she did in Halifax", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle7572.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3a0ex8zrn8ovm41x482h1zvloc5byx", "filename": "ISO_20121.txt", "story": "ISO 20121 (full name: ISO 20121:2012, \"Event sustainability management systems \u2013- Requirements with guidance for use\") is a voluntary international standard for sustainable event management, created by the International Organization for Standardization.

Rowling, who is worth an estimated PS530 million, said that the new novel will be nothing like the Harry Potter series, which sold over 30 million copies in the UK alone.

Another Cuban Orlando Ortega followed in 7.68 seconds and Balazs Baji of Hungary stood third in 7.70 seconds.

painkillers that eventually cost him his life. \n\n\"Jeff was a severe, severe opiate addict with chronic pain, one of the most serious and dangerous combination of problems you could possibly

to kill him,\" Pinsky said. \n\nConaway, 60, suffered from pneumonia and sepsis in recent weeks and had been in a medically-induced coma in an Encino, California, hospital for two weeks, manager Phil Brock said. \n\nHis family surrounded Conaway in his hospital room Thursday afternoon when he was taken off life support, Brock said. \n\n\"He was the consummate performer and entertainer,\" Brock

Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money. He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. \n\nLuther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin.

In the books of J.R.R. Tolkein, Bilbo Baggins finds a ring that can make him disappear. Of course, there's also poor Harry Potter, who used his invisibility cloak to hide from danger. \n\nNow that you've got some ideas, it's time for the hard part: building the cloak. To do that, you have to give up science fiction and turn to real science. An invisibility cloak has to cheat anything or anyone who might be watching. In order to understand how something can be seen, it's important to understand how we see. \n\nHuman beings can only see objects that reflect light waves. These waves enter the eye and are then processed by the brain. However, if an object doesn't reflect light, then the waves don't enter the eye, and the brain doesn't process. So building an invisibility cloak is building something that doesn't reflect light. \n\nCummer was part of a team of scientists from Duke University, including David Smith and David Schurig, who built the world's first version of an invisibility cloak. They had been inspired by the work of a British physicist, John Pendry. He in May said that an invisibility cloak was possible and Pendry was not the only one thinking about a disappearing act. At the same time, a Scottish physicist, UIf Leonhardt published a paper on building invisibility equipment. \n\n\"It wasn't easy,\" says Cummer. \"As often happens in science and research, it didn't work very well the first time. That first cloak didn't work like Harry Potter's --- the scientists didn't actually see anything disappear.

They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents. Over the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a \"published author.\" The mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player.

RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome. \n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins. \n\nLike DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins. In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis (like enzymes).

In the case of underage offenders, that requires a declaration from the youth's parents, officials said. \n\nMulyadi, superintendent of Bali's police drug squad, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the teen will be dealt with under the law applying to minors needing treatment for a drug problem. His parents would have to ensure he completes rehabilitation, Mulyadi said, and if they fail to report regularly they could face jail time. \n\nMichael Tene, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Friday that the nation's policy on drug offenses is clear. \"I believe everybody should know by now that illegal drugs in Indonesia will face a really severe penalty,\" he said. \n\nThe boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said that he and the Australian Embassy are concerned about the junior high school student's rights as a juvenile.

Exaggerated ruffles, soft draping, frothy fabrics, dramatic trains and Cinderella-esque silhouettes gave new meaning to the term Hollywood royalty. \n\nThe few celebrities who bucked the romantic trend, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep, chose sophisticated styles with retro vibes. \n\nFrom a timeless beauty (Demi Moore) to a graceful Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), here are the night's fashion winners. \n\nDemi Moore \n\nDemi Moore often chooses classic, tailored cuts, but last night she glowed in a stunning blush-toned Atelier Versace silk organza gown with petal-like tiers of ruffles. She finished off this softer look with Van Cleef & Arpels tassel earrings and diamond cuffs, a gold leather Salvatore Ferragamo clutch and dress-matching Versace satin sandals. \n\nDiane Kruger \n\nThe ever-flawless Diane Kruger turned to her favorite designer Karl Lagerfeld for her cream and black chiffon gown from Chanel Haute Couture. Both edgy and feminine, the design featured a pleated and ruffled skirt that led into a bow-bedecked mermaid train. \n\nSee more dresses from the 2010 Academy Awards \n\nJennifer Lopez \n\nWe love the way Jennifer Lopez commands the red carpet in dramatic dresses, and her choice this year was no exception.

Winn's oldest daughter, Daphne, is pregnant and getting married. His youngest daughter is lovelorn and mourning a recent abortion. \n\nStrong personalities clash as Winn struggles with his long-burning attraction to one of Daphne's gorgeous and wildly flirtatious bridesmaids, Agatha, as his marriage grows stale. \"He could not be sure that he had ever been in love with Biddy, or with anyone for that matter, but Biddy was the woman he had felt the most for.\" \n\nShipstead observes the absurdity of the upper class in Winn's trivial anxieties; he's incensed that he wasn't invited to join an elite golf club, and he carries on a rivalry with another island couple.

Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut. \n\nIn the United States and Canada, the term \"Eskimo\" was commonly used to describe the Inuit and Alaska's Yupik and I\u00f1upiat peoples. However, \"Inuit\" is not accepted as a term for the Yupik, and \"Eskimo\" is the only term that includes Yupik, I\u00f1upiat and Inuit. However, aboriginal peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit view \"Eskimo\" as pejorative, and \"Inuit\" is more commonly used in self-reference for these groups. In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classified the Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis. \n\nThe Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories, particularly around the Arctic Ocean.

when she could no longer manage them.\"There was this odd sense that the right person always showed up,\" says Ballance.Their arrangement worked remarkably well. \n\nUnmarried women are one of the fastest-growing groups in America; experts are concerned about how care-giving will be managed for them as they age.If the experience of Baer's friends is a guide, _ .It's already making it possible to create communities of caregivers who may have only one thing in common: the person who needs their help.On personal \"care pages\" set up through services such as Lotsa Helping Hands, friends and family members can post a list of tasks that need to be done, volunteer to do them, and keep updated on the person's condition.As Baer's cancer progressed, for example, her friends set up a page on Yahoo! where people could sign up to deliver meals or do errands . \n\nCatherine Fox, one of the friends who were present when Baer died, was deeply affected.\"It was so comforting to know that if you're willing to ask for help, the generosity of family and friends can be phenomenal .It makes me feel secure and hopeful to know that help is there when you need it.\"", "questions":

Ancient and modern history corrected. \n\nHaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, \u201cthat these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.\u201d I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them, \u201cwhether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves?\u201d ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is it a more full telling of?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is being righted?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who did he think might show up at the front of the commentators?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who else/", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many were forced to go?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How was Homer different from Aristotle?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How did he walk?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "His eyes?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How was Aristotle different?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did he use?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was his hair like?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "His voice?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who did the narrator introduce to Homer?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who else?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who whispered to the narrator?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did the two know the rest of the company?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Did he know the ghost's name?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 37, "span_end": 49, "span_text": "Glubbdubdrib", "input_text": "Glubbdubdrib", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 51, "span_end": 77, "span_text": "Ancient and modern history", "input_text": "Ancient and modern history", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 222, "span_end": 227, "span_text": "Homer", "input_text": "Homer", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 231, "span_end": 241, "span_text": " Aristotle", "input_text": "Aristotle", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 332, "span_end": 340, "span_text": "hundreds", "input_text": "hundreds", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 533, "span_end": 540, "span_text": " taller", "input_text": "taller", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 545, "span_end": 553, "span_text": "comelier", "input_text": "comelier", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 580, "span_end": 609, "span_text": "very erect for one of his age", "input_text": "very erect for one of his age", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 637, "span_end": 656, "span_text": " quick and piercing", "input_text": "quick and piercing", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 682, "span_end": 694, "span_text": "stooped much", "input_text": "stooped much", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 712, "span_end": 719, "span_text": "a staff", "input_text": "a staff", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 752, "span_end": 766, "span_text": " lank and thin", "input_text": "lank and thin", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 782, "span_end": 788, "span_text": "hollow", "input_text": "hollow", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1231, "span_end": 1238, "span_text": "Didymus", "input_text": "Didymus", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1243, "span_end": 1253, "span_text": "Eustathius", "input_text": "Eustathius", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 947, "span_end": 953, "span_text": " ghost", "input_text": "ghost", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 813, "span_end": 876, "span_text": "both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company,", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 975, "span_text": "a ghost who shall be nameless", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 18}], "name": "data/gutenberg/txt/Jonathan Swift___Gulliver's Travels.txt/CHAPTER VIII_bdfba9ee31dac403c683f6518c9ab68d727f6d5f34bbd1c2ee13b88"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3g5w44veu7iwtgkrgft4t2775x6kgj", "filename": "middle7620.txt", "story": "Bob, Jim and Alice are good friends.

He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. \n\nIn 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \"Populares\" were opposed by the \"Optimates\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51\u00a0BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain. \n\nThese achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53\u00a0BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49\u00a0BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Name one person in an alliance with Caesar?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "And another?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was the nickname of this alliance in the Roman Senate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Which group opposed them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Naame one person in the Optimates?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And another?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Which river did Caesar cross in defiance?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "With whom?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What happened then?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who won?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When were the Gallic wars completed?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Which rivers did Caesar cross in those wars?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How did he get across the Rhine>", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why did he cross the channel?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What did the senate ask him to do after the Gallic wars?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When was he born?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Was he an author?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "of what?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 362, "span_end": 368, "span_text": "Pompey", "input_text": "Pompey", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 348, "span_end": 356, "span_text": " Crassus", "input_text": "Crassus", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 480, "span_end": 489, "span_text": "Populares", "input_text": "Populares", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 511, "span_end": 521, "span_text": "\"Optimates", "input_text": "Optimates", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 559, "span_end": 575, "span_text": "Cato the Younger", "input_text": "Cato the Younger", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 605, "span_end": 611, "span_text": "Cicero", "input_text": "Cicero", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1284, "span_end": 1292, "span_text": " Rubicon", "input_text": "Rubicon", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1262, "span_end": 1268, "span_text": " 49\u00a0BC", "input_text": "49\u00a0BC", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1298, "span_end": 1314, "span_text": "the 13th Legion,", "input_text": "the 13th Legion,", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1383, "span_end": 1392, "span_text": "Civil war", "input_text": "Civil war", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1406, "span_end": 1413, "span_text": " Caesar", "input_text": "Caesar", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 665, "span_end": 670, "span_text": "51\u00a0BC", "input_text": "51\u00a0BC", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 700, "span_end": 734, "span_text": " the English Channel and the Rhine", "input_text": "the English Channel and the Rhine", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 820, "span_end": 837, "span_text": "he built a bridge", "input_text": "he built a bridge", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 878, "span_end": 896, "span_text": " to invade Britain", "input_text": "to invade Britain", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1145, "span_end": 1181, "span_text": " step down from his military command", "input_text": "step down from his military command", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 56, "span_end": 71, "span_text": " 13 July 100\u00a0BC", "input_text": "13 July 100\u00a0BC", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 74, "span_end": 88, "span_text": "15 March 44\u00a0BC", "input_text": "15 March 44\u00a0BC", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 297, "span_end": 327, "span_text": " notable author of Latin prose", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 315, "span_end": 327, "span_text": " Latin prose", "input_text": "Latin prose", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Julius_Caesar.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "31hq4x3t3saa3rb0wfzmxg3pjl6lsz", "filename": "Biome.txt", "story": "A biome is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in.

Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch. Managing approximately 25% of federal lands, it is the only major national land agency that is outside of the U.S. Department of the Interior. \n\nThe concept of the National Forests was born from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s conservation group, Boone and Crockett Club, due to concerns regarding Yellowstone National Park beginning as early as 1875. In 1876, Congress created the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. Franklin B. Hough was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed Division of Forestry. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as \"forest reserves,\" managed by the Department of the Interior.

Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. \n\nThe research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. \n\n\"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\" said Barnes. \"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\" \n\nPhone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\" \n\nThe co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. \"We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,\" Barnes says. \"It's been a great adventure.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the subject of the article?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is it used for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How effective is it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who conducted a study on phone cleanliness?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did they find?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What led to the invention of Phone Soap?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who were the founders?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Are they related?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How were bacteria and viruses destroyed in LaPorte's lab?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was LaPorte's realization?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does Phone Soap look like?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does a phone have to be charging for it to work?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is the phone plugged in the wall?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How long does the process take?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Can the phone be left charging overnight?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is used to make sure the phone is completely cleaned?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Where did the inventors showcase Phone Soap?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 507, "span_end": 541, "span_text": "led to the invention of Phone Soap", "input_text": "Phone Soap", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 674, "span_end": 715, "span_text": "kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses", "input_text": "kills bacteria and viruses on phone", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 674, "span_end": 691, "span_text": "kill 99.9 percent", "input_text": "99.9 percent", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 327, "span_end": 403, "span_text": "University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria", "input_text": "University of London", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 323, "span_end": 354, "span_text": "011 University of London study ", "input_text": "2011", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 366, "span_end": 423, "span_text": "ne in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them", "input_text": "ne in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 470, "span_end": 507, "span_text": "The research on bacteria and viruses ", "input_text": "research on bacteria and viruses", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 891, "span_end": 928, "span_text": "Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder", "input_text": "Wes Barnes and Dan LaPorte", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 951, "span_end": 976, "span_text": "his cousin and co-founder", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 951, "span_end": 977, "span_text": "his cousin and co-founder,", "input_text": "cousins", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1153, "span_end": 1183, "span_text": "UV-C light for destroying them", "input_text": "UV-C light", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1153, "span_end": 1223, "span_text": "UV-C light for destroying them.

There are people who lose the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage. But they become extremely good at something else. They become experts at spotting liars.

A study conducted in Massachusetts, U.S., has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors . \n\nIn the last 100 years, many doctors studying the brain have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognizing false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine Nature. \n\n`Fourteen years ago, famous American doctor, Dr. Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. He remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia room were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech. He was trying to put feelings into each and every word of his speech. But his speech had an opposite effect on the patients. They were not impressed. On the contrary, the whole room shook with their laughter. The aphasics knew that he did not mean a word of what he was saying. \n\nDr. Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people \"get carried away\" by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding.

He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. This makes it difficult to know exactly what Plato wrote. \n\nAlong with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. Plato's influence on Christianity is often thought to be mediated by his major influence on Saint Augustine of Hippo, one of the most important philosophers and theologians in the foundation of the Western thought. In the 19th century, the philosopher Nietzsche called Christianity \"Platonism for the people\". Numenius of Apamea viewed this differently, he called Plato the Hellenic Moses. This would justify the superiority of Christianity over Hellenism because Moses predates Plato\u2014thus the original source of this wisdom is the root of Christianity and not Hellenistic culture.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who was a philosopher?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what did he found?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what is that?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what was special about it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What makes it difficult to know what he wrote?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "who was his teacher?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "who was one of his students?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "is that the most notable one?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what did the three achieve together?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what kind?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "where can Plato's footnotes be found?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "was he the founder of anything else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "through what influence?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "who is that?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "was he significant?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who was a philosopher in the 19th century?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what did he say about a certain religion?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 5, "span_text": "Plato", "input_text": "Plato", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 100, "span_end": 116, "span_text": "Classical Greece", "input_text": "Classical Greece", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 136, "span_end": 157, "span_text": "the Academy in Athens", "input_text": "the Academy in Athens", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 168, "span_end": 199, "span_text": " institution of higher learning", "input_text": "an institution of higher learning", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 158, "span_end": 220, "span_text": " the first institution of higher learning in the Western world", "input_text": "it was the first  in the Western world", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 491, "span_end": 574, "span_text": "the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death", "input_text": "the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after he died", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 660, "span_end": 669, "span_text": "Socrates,", "input_text": "Socrates", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 699, "span_end": 708, "span_text": "Aristotle", "input_text": "Aristotle", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 678, "span_end": 689, "span_text": "most famous", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 715, "span_end": 775, "span_text": " laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science", "input_text": "they laid foundations of  philosophy and science", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 745, "span_end": 752, "span_text": "Western", "input_text": "Western", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 852, "span_end": 888, "span_text": "the European philosophical tradition", "input_text": "in the European philosophical tradition", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1077, "span_end": 1129, "span_text": "of the founders of Western religion and spirituality", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1096, "span_end": 1129, "span_text": "Western religion and spirituality", "input_text": "Western religion and spirituality", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1196, "span_end": 1247, "span_text": " by his major influence on Saint Augustine of Hippo", "input_text": "by his influence on Saint Augustine of Hippo", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1274, "span_end": 1303, "span_text": " philosophers and theologians", "input_text": "a philosophersand theologian", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1248, "span_end": 1274, "span_text": " one of the most important", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1249, "span_end": 1274, "span_text": "one of the most important", "input_text": "one of the most important", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1382, "span_end": 1392, "span_text": " Nietzsche", "input_text": "Nietzsche", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1412, "span_end": 1439, "span_text": " \"Platonism for the people\"", "input_text": "that it was  \"Platonism for the people\"", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Plato.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "369j354ofdapu1z2ebz3jj2p5hr6g0", "filename": "Cambridge.txt", "story": "Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam approximately north of London.

Their daughter was asleep in bed, and their son was watching \"American Idol\" in the living room. \n\nAbout 10:30 p.m., the suspect entered the home through French doors that face the ocean, police said. \n\nThe killer was dressed in dark clothing and wore a motorcycle helmet, authorities said. He walked past the child who was watching television and stabbed the Husteds. \n\nDavina Husted was four months pregnant. \n\nThe home was not ransacked, and the alleged murder weapon was left at the scene, Bonfiglio said. \n\nA sample of Packer's DNA taken after an arrest in Santa Barbara matched the genetic material found at the Husted crime scene, said Pentis the sheriff's department chief.

Joyce, young Blodget, Jamie and Mike, led by their commander in person, were to compose the whole force on the occasion; and every man had been busy in getting his arms, ammunition and provisions ready, for the last half-hour.

Joel and his followers were still at work, in distant fields; but they all carefully avoided that side of the Knoll which would have brought them within reach of the musket, and this left all behind the cliff unobserved, unless Indians were in the woods in that direction. As Mike had so recently passed in by that route, however, the probability was the whole party still remained in the neighbourhood of the mills, where all accounts agreed in saying they mainly kept. It was the intention of the captain, therefore, to sally by the rivulet and the rear of the house, and to gain the woods under cover of the bushes on the banks of the former, as had already been done by so many since the inroad. \n\nThe great difficulty was to quit the house, and reach the bed of the stream, unseen. This step, however, was a good deal facilitated by means of Joel's sally-port, the overseer having taken, himself, all the precautions against detection of which the case well admitted. Nevertheless, there was the distance between the palisades and the base of the rocks, some forty or fifty yards, which was entirely uncovered, and had to be passed under the notice of any wandering eyes that might happen to be turned in that quarter.

For him, the long flight produced a hit video on YouTube and no major physical problems. But 40 years ago, scientists did not know how humans would react to long-term spaceflight. To find out, NASA, the American space agency, launched Skylab in May, 1973. Over nearly a year, three teams of astronauts visited Skylab for stays of between 28 to 84 days. They learned how people react to extended periods in space. \n\nGerald Carr commanded Skylab 4. He spoke at a NASA event marking the 40th anniversary of Skylab's launch. He said that the loss of the body's muscle mass was a main concern. Astronauts on Skylab used exercise equipment to stay strong. The astronauts spent their workdays carrying out experiments, including biomedical research. \n\nMarshall Porterfield is the director of NASA's Space Life and Physical Sciences Division.

The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project. This has led to some controversy. \n\nLinux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of the Linux kernel-based Android OS on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on 99.6% of the TOP500 supercomputers. It is used by around 2.3% of desktop computers. The Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome\u00a0OS, dominates the US K\u201312 education market and represents nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales in the US. Linux also runs on embedded systems \u2013 devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system.

Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech. \n\nElliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. \"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,\" he said. \n\nArmstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" and said: \"Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\" \n\nSpeaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was \"among the greatest of \n\nAmerican heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\". He added: \"And when Neil stepped on the \n\nmoon for the first time, it was a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\" \n\nBuzz Aldrin flew with Armstrong on Apollo 11. He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion. \n\n\"When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,\" he said. \"Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans \n\nhad ever been, we were not alone. Almost the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know many millions of people around the world will join me in mourning the death of a true \n\nAmerican hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will always be remembered as a historic moment in human history.\" \n\nIn the US, people felt that he represented the achievement of a past age of American greatness. Today, things are very different: NASA has cancelled a number of missions because they don't have enough money. \n\nFormer astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, said: \"Neil did something that people thought was impossible.\" Others complained about the state of the US. Journalist Andrew Pasternak wrote: \"It will take longer to rebuild lower Manhattan after 9/11 than it took to build an entire space program and send a man to the moon.\" \n\nOf course, NASA has its modern successes. Its engineers have landed a nuclear-powered robot on Mars. There will also be another Mars mission. It will drill below the planet's surface. But these achievements are not as exciting as Armstrong's. NASA administrator Charles Bolden expressed that in his tribute. \"As we enter this next era of space exploration, we are standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong,\" he said. \n\nArmstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become. Blogger Eric Berger saw an email from Armstrong and other former astronauts. It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: \"If you don't know where you are \n\ngoing, you might not get there.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did Neil Armstrong die from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was his death unexpected?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is he known for?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Had anybody walked on the moon before him?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What year was the last person walking on it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And who was the last one?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What President honored him at the WH?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did he say about Armstrong?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How old was he when he died?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was he proud of what NASA became?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who did he quote in an e-mail?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 673, "span_end": 701, "span_text": "heart problems after surgery", "input_text": "He had heart complications", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 745, "span_end": 784, "span_text": "his death was a surprise to many people", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 232, "span_end": 306, "span_text": "Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech", "input_text": "Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 15, "span_end": 50, "span_text": " the first man to walk on the moon,", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 203, "span_end": 207, "span_text": "1972", "input_text": "1972", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 2360, "span_end": 2374, "span_text": "Eugene Cernan,", "input_text": "Eugene Cernan", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1021, "span_end": 1065, "span_text": "\nSpeaking from the White House, Barack Obama", "input_text": "Barack Obama", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1053, "span_end": 1166, "span_text": "Barack Obama said Armstrong was \"among the greatest of \n\nAmerican heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\"", "input_text": "\"among the greatest of American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\"", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 51, "span_end": 76, "span_text": "has died at the age of 82", "input_text": "82", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 3100, "span_end": 3151, "span_text": "\nArmstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become", "input_text": "No, disappointed.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 3230, "span_end": 3406, "span_text": "It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: \"If you don't know where you are \n\ngoing, you might not get there.\"", "input_text": "Frustration with problems at NASA", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high23469.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "32svav9l3f9pnrzh999vguf2wgw3a4", "filename": "middle3264.txt", "story": "Recently, China Dream has been the subject of a public topic.

It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington. Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County. \n\nLouisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a system across 13 states. Today, the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six \"Fortune\" 500 companies. Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service's worldwide air hub. \n\nSince 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger. The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson\u00a0County Metro\u00a0Government, abbreviated to Louisville\u00a0Metro.

He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school. \n\nFred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes. \n\nHe kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\" \n\nThe doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection. \n\nBesides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school and staying to play after it was dismissed. \n\nThe boys missed him and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was \"Wanted at home.\" \n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton, \"I'll find him out, boys-see if I don't!\" \n\nSo, one morning on his way to school, he called on Fred. As he went around to the side door, he walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was ly needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand. \n\nOf course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess .\"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes!\"\"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\"\"Lost your apron, haven't you, Polly!\" \n\nFred was not wanting either in spirit or in courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors . But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him. \n\nWhile he was struggling for self-mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, \"Don't give up!

George Strong, the assistant master, also came down and showed some of the older boys how to cut fancy figures. Dick was a good skater, and took to the fancy figures with ease.

Accordingly Nahoon sent them, saying that he himself would follow with Black Heart in the course of a few days, as at present the white man was not sufficiently recovered from his hurts to allow of his travelling fast and far. So the soldiers went, doubting nothing. \n\nThen Umgona gave it out that in obedience to the command of the king he was about to start for Ulundi, taking with him his daughter Nanea to be delivered over into the _Sigodhla_, and also those fifteen head of cattle that had been _lobola'd_ by Nahoon in consideration of his forthcoming marriage, whereof he had been fined by Cetywayo.

Surely this isn't the curve he's troubled about? \n\nBut of course that's wrong: Eastwood knows best. Part of his longevity as a star comes from his readiness to probe his own weaknesses, and it should come as no surprise that he's candid -- and funny -- about the frailties of old age. \n\nHis character, Gus, is a scout for the Braves, one of the best there ever was. But has he still got what it takes? Not only is he computer illiterate, but the guy still reads newspapers. That's not all: He's losing his eyesight, and though he's doing his best to hide it, it's getting harder to explain the rapid accumulation of dinks and dents in his convertible. \n\nThings come to a head the week before the draft. He's sent to North Carolina to check out the next big slugger. His buddy Pete (John Goodman) begs Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to cover his back. \n\nA hotshot lawyer on the verge of making partner, she's got plenty of reasons to turn him down flat, including that her dad's a cranky and uncommunicative curmudgeon and always has been. In her childhood, he dragged her round ball fields or packed her off to boarding school without ever thinking to ask her preference, and she's been in therapy since college. She goes anyway.

As a Portuguese colony, Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the Kwanyama and the Mbunda. Independence was achieved in 1975 under a Marxist-Leninist one party state, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba after a protracted anti-colonial struggle.

Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, \"There are no happy jobs, only happy workers.\" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics. \n\nFirst, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, \"My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'\" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys. \n\nSecond, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, \"I work with the coolest people in the world.\" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, \"There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying.\" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people. \n\nThird, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work. \n\nTony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, \"Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous.\" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who does Gordon want to assist?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How would she like to do that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Are there \"HAppy Jobs\"?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Do half of the workers on the continent even like their jobs?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many do?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "If there are no happy jobs, what are there, according to Gordon?", "turn_id": 6}], "answers": [{"span_start": 326, "span_end": 374, "span_text": "people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs", "input_text": "people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 406, "span_text": "find work that is good for them", "input_text": "Help them find work that is good for them", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 422, "span_end": 445, "span_text": "There are no happy jobs", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 217, "span_end": 273, "span_text": "30% of employees in North America do not like their jobs", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 211, "span_end": 220, "span_text": "about 30%", "input_text": "About 30%.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 452, "span_end": 465, "span_text": "happy workers", "input_text": "Happy workers.", "turn_id": 6}], "name": "high4443.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3ixqg4fa2tygl3tpwwa12i2uf4kb9a", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Baronness Orczy___The Tangled Skein.txt/CHAPTER XXIII_a07544e8c5a76e98bd26cf0b40befffe20cc4b91d4fcc8767784bea", "story": "CHAPTER XXIII \n\nCHECK TO THE QUEEN \n\nHow long they stood thus, heart to heart, they themselves could never have said. The sound of many voices in the near distance roused them from their dream.

He seemed much amused at her nervousness; what had she to fear? was she not his own, to protect even from the semblance of ill? But Ursula, now fully awakened to ordinary, everyday surroundings, was fearful lest her own innocent little deception should be too crudely, too suddenly unmasked. \n\nShe had so earnestly looked forward to the moment when she would say to him that she in sooth was none other than Lady Ursula Glynde, the woman whom every conventionality had decreed that he should marry, and whom--because of these conventionalities--he had secretly but certainly disliked. \n\nHer woman's heart had already given her a clear insight into the character and the foibles of the man she loved. His passion for her now, sincere and great though it was, was partly dependent on that atmosphere of romance which his poetical temperament craved for, and which had surrounded the half-mysterious personality of exquisite, irresistible \"Fanny.\" \n\nInstinctively she dreaded the rough hand of commonplace, that ugly, coarse destroyer of poetic idylls. A few hastily uttered words might shatter in an hour the mystic shrine wherein Wessex had enthroned her. She had meant to tell him soon, to-morrow perhaps, perhaps only after a few days, but she wished to find her own time for this, when he knew her inner soul better, and the delicate cobwebs of this great love-at-first-sight had fallen away from his eyes.

It is the last major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. \n\nParamount Pictures dates its existence from the 1912 founding date of the Famous Players Film Company. Hungarian-born founder, Adolph Zukor, who had been an early investor in nickelodeons, saw that movies appealed mainly to working-class immigrants. With partners Daniel Frohman and Charles Frohman he planned to offer feature-length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time (leading to the slogan \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\"). By mid-1913, Famous Players had completed five films, and Zukor was on his way to success.

Wars of Edward III.--By the Salic law, as the lawyers called it, the crown was given, on the death of Charles IV., to _Philip, Count of Valois_, son to a brother of Philip IV., but it was claimed by Edward III. of England as son of the daughter of Philip IV. Edward contented himself, however, with the mere assertion of his pretensions, until Philip exasperated him by attacks on the borders of Guienne, which the French kings had long been coveting to complete their possession of the south, and by demanding the surrender of Robert of Artois, who, being disappointed in his claim to the county of Artois by the judgment of the Parliament of Paris, was practising by sorcery on the life of the King of France. Edward then declared war, and his supposed right caused a century of warfare between France and England, in which the broken, down-trodden state of the French peasantry gave England an immense advantage. The knights and squires were fairly matched; but while the English yeomen were strong, staunch, and trustworthy, the French were useless, and only made a defeat worse by plundering the fallen on each side alike. The war began in Flanders, where Philip took the part of the count, whose tyrannies had caused his expulsion.

The elder Baroness had, at least, the merit of a stout heart, and, even with her sadly-reduced garrison, feared none of them. She had been brought up in the faith that Adlerstein was impregnable, and so she still believed; and, if the disaster that had cut off her husband and son was to happen at all, she was glad that it had befallen before the homage had been paid. Probably the Schlangenwald Count knew how tough a morsel the castle was like to prove, and Wildschloss was serving at a distance, for nothing was heard of either during the short interval while the roads were still open. During this time an attempt had been made through Father Norbert to ascertain what had become of the corpses of the two Barons and their followers, and it had appeared that the Count had carried them all off from the inn, no doubt to adorn his castle with their limbs, or to present them to the Emperor in evidence of his zeal for order. The old Baron could not indeed have been buried in consecrated ground, nor have masses said for him; but for the weal of her son's soul Dame Kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments, and Christina added her gold earrings, and all her scanty purse, that both her husband and father might be joined in the prayers of the Church--trying with all her might to put confidence in Hugh Sorel's Loretto relic, and the Indulgence he had bought, and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to the ever stronger dawnings of good she had watched in her own Eberhard.

He was a rural mill carrier, and on Saturdays he would ask me to go with him. Driving through the countryside was always an adventure: There were animals to see, people to visit, and chocolate cookies if you knew where to stop, and Dad did. \n\nIn the spring, Dad delivered boxes full of baby chickens, and when 1 was a boy it was such a fun to stick your finger 'through one of the holes of the boxes and let the baby birds peck on your fingers. \n\nOn Dad' s final day of work, it took him well into the evening to complete his rounds because at least one member from each family was waiting at their mailbox to thank him for his friendship and his years of service. \"Two hundred and nineteen mailboxes on my route.\" he used to say, \"and a story at every one. \" One lady had no mailbox, so Dad took the mail in to her every day because she was nearly blind. Once inside, he read her mail and helped her pay her bills. \n\nMailboxes were sometimes used for things other than mail. One note left in a mailbox read. \"Nat, take these eggs to Marian; she's baking a cake and doesn't have any eggs. \" Mailboxes might be buried in the snow, or broken, or lying on the groom:. bat the mail was always delivered On cold days Dad might find one of his customers waiting for him with a cup of hot chocolate. A young wrote letters but had no stamps, so she left a few button on the envelope in the mailbox; Dad paid for the stamps. One businessman used to leave large amounts of cash in his mailbox for Dad to take to the bank. Once, the amount came to 8 32,000. \n\nA dozen years ago, when I traveled back to my hometown on the sad occasion of Dad's death, the mailboxes along the way reminded me of some of his stories. I thought I knew them all, but that wasn't the case. \n\nAs I drove home, I noticed two lamp poles, one on each side of the street. When my dad was around, those poles supported wooden boxes about four feet off the ground. One box was painted green and the other was red, and each had a long narrow hole at the top with white lettering: SANTA CLAUS, NORTH POLE. For years children had dropped letters to Santa through those holes. \n\nI made a turn at the comer and drove past the post office and across the railroad tracks to our house. Mom and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I heard footsteps. There, at the door, stood Frank Townsend, Dad's postmaster and great friend for many years. So we all sat down at the table and began to tell stories. \n\nAt one point Frank looked at me with tears in his eyes. \" What are we going to do about the letters this Christmas?\" he asked. \n\n\"The letters?\" \n\n'I guess you never knew. \" \n\n\"Knew what?\" \n\n\" Remember, when you were a kid and you used to put your letters to Santa in those green and red boxes on Main Street? It was your dad who answered all those letters every year. \" \n\nI just sat there with tears in my eyes. It wasn't hard for me to imagine Dad sitting at the old table in our basement reading those letters and answering each one. I have since spoken with several of the people who received Christmas letters during their childhood, and they told me how amazed they were that Santa had known so much about their homes and families. \n\nFor me, just knowing that story about my father was the gift of a lifetime.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What other things were mailboxes used?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "did the writer travel city roads?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "was it boring?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who was he traveling with?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what day of the week did he go with his dad?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what season did the dad carry chicks?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how many mailboxes on his route?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "how many stories?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how did the lady with no box get her mail?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what elkse did he do?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who needed the eggs?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "how much cash was in the box at one time?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did he get on cold days?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what color were the Christmas mailboxes?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who is Frank?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "his Surname?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what did the writer not know?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "which letters?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1094, "span_end": 1099, "span_text": "eggs ", "input_text": "eggs", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 76, "span_end": 82, "span_text": " rural", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 3, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 55, "span_end": 67, "span_text": "with my dad.", "input_text": "Dad", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 101, "span_end": 114, "span_text": "on Saturdays ", "input_text": "on Saturdays", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 325, "span_text": "In the spring,", "input_text": "Spring", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 734, "span_end": 768, "span_text": "Two hundred and nineteen mailboxes", "input_text": "219", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 800, "span_end": 825, "span_text": "and a story at every one.", "input_text": "219", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 855, "span_end": 893, "span_text": " Dad took the mail in to her every day", "input_text": "took it to her", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 937, "span_end": 984, "span_text": "he read her mail and helped her pay her bills.

Microbiology, the scientific study of microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax. \n\nMicroorganisms include all unicellular organisms, and so are extremely diverse. Of the three domains of life identified by Carl Woese, all of the Archaea, and Bacteria are microorganisms. These were previously grouped together in the two domain system as Prokaryotes, the other being the eukaryotes. The third domain Eukaryota includes all multicellular organisms, and many unicellular protists and protozoans. Some protists are related to animals and some to green plants. Many of the multicellular organisms are microscopic, namely micro-animals, some fungi and some algae, but these are not discussed here. \n\nThey live in almost every habitat from the poles to the equator, deserts, geysers, rocks, and the deep sea. Some are adapted to extremes such as very hot or very cold conditions, others to high pressure and a few such as \"Deinococcus radiodurans\" to high radiation environments.

Also came claims that an unpublished study had found that mobile phones cause memory loss. And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones heat the brain. \n\nFor anyone who uses a moblie phone, these are worring times. But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scared and you will hear a different story. \n\nWhat we do have, however, are some results suggesting that mobile phones'emission have a variety of strange effects on living tissue that can't be explained by the general radiation biology. And it's only when the questions raised by these experients are answered that we'll be able to say for sure what moblie phones might be doing to the brain. \n\nOne of the odd effects comes from the now famous\"merrory loss\" study. Alan Preece and his colleagues at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofBristolplaced a device that imitated the microwave emission of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers. The volunteers were all goood at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen. Preece says he still can't comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end. But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive abilities.\"I'm pretty sure there is no effect on short-term memory,\" he says. \n\nAnother expert, Tatterasll, remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss. One result, for instance, suggests that nerve cell synapses exposed to microwaves become more----rather than less-----receptive to under-going changes linked to the memory formation. \n\nIt would be an even happier outcome if microwave turned out to be good for you. It sounds crazy, but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California, found that mice exposed to microwave for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours when given a cancer-causing chemical. \n\nSo should we forget about mobile phone radiation causing brain tumours and scrambling our minds? \n\n\"If it doesn't certainly cause cancer in animals and cells, then it probably isn't going to cause cancer in humans,\"says William.

She was just an average high school athlete. There was every indication that she was just another American teenager without much of a future. However, one person wants to change this. Stephen Francis observed then eighteen-year-old Shelly Ann as a track meet and was convinced that he had seen the beginning of true greatness. Her time were not exactly impressive, but even so, he seemed there was something trying to get out, something the other coaches had overlooked when they had assessed her and found her lacking. He decided to offer Shelly Ann a place in his very strict training seasons. Their cooperation quickly produced results, and a few year later at Jamaica's Olympic games in early 2008, Shelly Ann, who at that time only ranked number 70 in the world, beat Jamaica's unchallenged queen of the sprint . \n\n\"Where did she come from?\" asked an astonished sprinting world, before concluding that she must be one of those one-hit wonders that spring up from time to time, only to disappear again without signs. But Shelly Ann was to prove that she was anything but a one-hit wonder. At the Beijing Olympic she swept away any doubts about her ability to perform consistently by becoming the first Jamaican woman ever to win the 100 meters Olympic gold. She did it again one year on at the World Championship in Briton, becoming world champion with a time of 10.73--- the fourth record ever. \n\nShelly-Ann is a little woman with a big smile. She has a mental toughness that did not come about by chance. Her journey to becoming the fastest woman on earth has been anything but smooth and effortless. She grew up in one of Jamaica's toughest inner-city communities known as Waterhouse, where she lived in a one-room apartment, sleeping four in a bed with her mother and two brothers. Waterhouse, one of the poorest communities in Jamaica, is a really violent and overpopulated place. Several of Shelly-Ann's friends and family were caught up in the killings; one of her cousins was shot dead only a few streets away from where she lived. Sometimes her family didn't have enough to eat. She ran at the school championships barefooted because she couldn't afford shoes. Her mother Maxime, one of a family of fourteen, had been an athlete herself as a young girl but, like so many other girls in Waterhouse, had to stop after she had her first baby. Maxime's early entry into the adult world with its responsibilities gave her the determination to ensure that her kids would not end up in Waterhouse's roundabout of poverty. One of the first things Maxime used to do with Shelly-Ann was taking her to the track, and she was ready to sacrifice everything. \n\nIt didn't take long for Shelly-Ann to realize that sports could be her way out of Waterhouse. On a summer evening in Beijing in 2008, all those long, hard hours of work and commitment finally bore fruit. The barefoot kid who just a few years previously had been living in poverty, surrounded by criminals and violence, had written a new chapter in the history of sports. \n\nBut Shelly-Ann's victory was far greater than that. The night she won Olympic gold in Beijing, the routine murders in Waterhouse and the drug wars in the neighbouring streets stopped. The dark cloud above one of the world's toughest criminal neighbourhoods simply disappeared for a few days. \" I have so much fire burning for my country,\"Shelly said. She plans to start a foundation for homeless children and wants to build a community centre in Waterhouse. She hopes to inspire the Jamaicans to lay down their weapons. She intends to fight to make it a woman's as well as a man's world. \n\nAs Muhammad Ali puts it, \" Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them. A desire, a dream, a vision.\" One of the things Shelly-Ann can be proud of is her understanding of this truth.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the name of this girl?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What country is she from?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is she an only child?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many siblings does she have?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was she rich growing up?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was the highest level medal she earned?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What social causes is she interested in?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What kind of running footwear did she use when she was a kid?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many rooms was the place she grew up in?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What famous person is quoted in this story?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 45, "span_end": 69, "span_text": "Shelly Ann Francis Pryce", "input_text": "Shelly Ann Francis Pryce", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1697, "span_end": 1761, "span_text": " She grew up in one of Jamaica's toughest inner-city communities", "input_text": "Jamaica", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1852, "span_end": 1879, "span_text": "her mother and two brothers", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1867, "span_end": 1879, "span_text": "two brothers", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1881, "span_end": 1934, "span_text": "Waterhouse, one of the poorest communities in Jamaica", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 3176, "span_end": 3206, "span_text": "The night she won Olympic gold", "input_text": "gold", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 3475, "span_end": 3528, "span_text": "She plans to start a foundation for homeless children", "input_text": "homeless children", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 2183, "span_end": 2263, "span_text": "She ran at the school championships barefooted because she couldn't afford shoes", "input_text": "none", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1789, "span_end": 1822, "span_text": "she lived in a one-room apartment", "input_text": "one", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 3714, "span_end": 3737, "span_text": "As Muhammad Ali puts it", "input_text": "Muhammad Ali", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high13738.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3cplwgv3mozimcimzmfatd2oviz9nb", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Mark Twain___Tom Sawyer, Detective.txt/CHAPTER VI_f537f2843bba44d2d99bbe74e7d0cb70d9551e0c219430fe38ca018", "story": "CHAPTER VI.

His political philosophy influenced the Enlightenment in France and across Europe, as well as aspects of the French Revolution and the overall development of modern political and educational thought. \n\nRousseau's novel \"Emile, or On Education\" is a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His sentimental novel \"Julie, or the New Heloise\" was of importance to the development of pre-romanticism and romanticism in fiction. Rousseau's autobiographical writings\u2014his \"Confessions\", which initiated the modern autobiography, and his \"Reveries of a Solitary Walker\"\u2014exemplified the late 18th-century movement known as the \"Age of Sensibility\", and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing. His \"Discourse on Inequality\" and \"The Social Contract\" are cornerstones in modern political and social thought. \n\nDuring the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophes among members of the Jacobin Club.

Gold medal performances require some serious nutrition. Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? \n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. \n\nCrazy Calorie Count \n\n_ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. \n\nAthletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day. \n\nSnacking Secrets \n\nSome athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. \n\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. \n\nFoods for Recovery \n\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? \n\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Keri Glassman?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did she found?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What show did she go on?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many calories does Michael Phelps take in?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is his sport?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many calories does he burn?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did he do in Beijing?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who is Yohan Blake?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is his event?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who did he beat at trials?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many bananas does he eat?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who is Jonathan Horton?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does he have a physical issue?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What solves his problem?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who is Lochte?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What is one thing he eliminated from his diet?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What does he throw to gain strength?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What does he flip?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 195, "span_end": 232, "span_text": "Keri Glassman, a registered dietitian", "input_text": "a registered dietitian", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 195, "span_end": 269, "span_text": "Keri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals", "input_text": "Nutritious Life Meals", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 270, "span_end": 305, "span_text": " appeared on \"Good Morning America\"", "input_text": "Good Morning America", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 583, "span_text": "Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day.", "input_text": "as many as 12,000 calories in one day.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 450, "span_end": 473, "span_text": " swimmer Michael Phelps", "input_text": "swimming", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 696, "span_end": 736, "span_text": "Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000", "input_text": "4,000 to 6,000", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 499, "span_end": 582, "span_text": "in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day", "input_text": "consume as many as 12,000 calories in one day", "turn_id": 7, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 945, "span_end": 978, "span_text": "Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter", "input_text": "a sprinter", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 945, "span_end": 992, "span_text": "Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter", "input_text": "100-meter", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1009, "span_end": 1121, "span_text": "has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials", "input_text": "Usain Bolt", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1160, "span_end": 1206, "span_text": "Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day", "input_text": "16 per day", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1225, "span_end": 1258, "span_text": "Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast", "input_text": "a gymnast", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1225, "span_end": 1300, "span_text": "Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1225, "span_end": 1301, "span_text": "Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem.", "input_text": "a blood sugar problem.", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1302, "span_end": 1323, "span_text": "His solution is honey", "input_text": "honey", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1568, "span_text": "swimmer Ryan Lochte", "input_text": "a swimmer", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1701, "span_end": 1739, "span_text": "Lochte, who recently cut out junk food", "input_text": "junk food", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1701, "span_end": 1755, "span_text": "Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda", "input_text": "candy and soda", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1757, "span_end": 1893, "span_text": "has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs", "input_text": "beer kegs", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1757, "span_end": 1845, "span_text": "has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires", "input_text": "tires", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high3446.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3p59jyt76lk5h527b9m7sp02f4v2ti", "filename": "Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics.txt", "story": "The Encyclopedia of Mathematics (also EOM and formerly Encyclopaedia of Mathematics) is a large reference work in mathematics.
