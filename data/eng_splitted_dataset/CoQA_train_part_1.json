Until an hour ago, I thought I was dead,\" the reporter, Sono Domenico Quirico, said, according to his newspaper La Stampa. \n\nAnother of the journalists, Elisabetta Rosaspina, told CNN they were kidnapped in Tripoli between Martyrs Square and Moammar Gadhafi's compound. Earlier reports said they had been abducted 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from Tripoli. \n\nClaudio Monici, a correspondent for the newspaper Avvenire, said they were seized by the Libyan army and \"other people with guns.\" \n\n\"We understood that they were very angry. Their eyes had blood,\" he said, saying some of their captors said: \"You are Italian. You are from NATO. You are bombing us.\" \n\nMonici saw their captors kill their Libyan driver, he said. \n\n\"He understood that it was his last moment. We saw them kick him and kill him... When they shot at him I saw that he was praying... I saw that his lips were moving,\" he told Sky News. \n\nMassari said while it was unclear who captured the journalists, the ministry assumed it was pro-Gadhafi forces. \n\nAll of the journalists, from prominent Italian daily newspapers, were well, Massari said Wednesday. He did not elaborate. \n\nPaolo Alfieri, foreign editor of the newspaper Avvenire, identified the four as Rosaspina and Giuseppe Sarcina from the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Quirico from La Stampa, and Monici from Avvenire.

WORDSWORTH. \n\nEtheldred awoke long before time for getting up, and lay pondering over her visions. Margaret had sympathised, and therefore they did not seem entirely aerial. To earn money by writing was her favourite plan, and she called her various romances in turn before her memory, to judge which might be brought down to sober pen and ink. She considered till it became not too unreasonably early to get up. It was dark, but there was a little light close to the window: she had no writing-paper, but she would interline her old exercise-book. Down she ran, and crouching in the school-room window-seat, she wrote on in a trance of eager composition, till Norman called her, as he went to school, to help him to find a book. \n\nThis done, she went up to visit Margaret, to tell her the story, and consult her. But this was not so easy. She found Margaret with little Daisy lying by her, and Tom sitting by the fire over his Latin. \n\n\"Oh, Ethel, good-morning, dear! you are come just in time.\" \n\n\"To take baby?\" said Ethel, as the child was fretting a little. \n\n\"Yes, thank you, she has been very good, but she was tired of lying here, and I can't move her about,\" said Margaret. \n\n\"Oh, Margaret, I have such a plan,\" said Ethel, as she walked about with little Gertrude; but Tom interrupted. \n\n\"Margaret, will you see if I can say my lesson?\" and the thumbed Latin grammar came across her just as Dr. May's door opened, and he came in exclaiming, \"Latin grammar! Margaret, this is really too much for you. Good-morning, my dears. Ha! Tommy, take your book away, my boy. You must not inflict that on sister now.

Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava fall within the borders of Silesia. \n\nSilesia's borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states. The first known states to hold power there were probably those of Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia early in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its division in the 12th century became a Piast duchy. In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526.", "questions": [{"input_text": "True or False: Silesia is contained entirely in Germany.", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many countries is it in?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where is most of it located?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What are the other two countries it is part of?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When did Bohemia rule there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What other state ruled it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What happened to Silesia in the 900s?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did it become in the 1100s?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What state ruled the Crown Lands?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "True or False: The Holy Roman Empire passed to the Bourbon Monarchy.", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "To which monarchy did the Crown lands pass?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is the German name for Silesia?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many people live there?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What flowing water is it near?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is Silesia further divided in any way?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Into how many parts?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What are they called?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What is its major city?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 104, "span_end": 128, "span_text": "located mostly in Poland", "input_text": "False.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 122, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "Poland, with small parts in the Czech Republic and Germany", "input_text": "Three.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 104, "span_end": 128, "span_text": "located mostly in Poland", "input_text": "Poland", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 140, "span_end": 181, "span_text": " parts in the Czech Republic and Germany.", "input_text": "the Czech Republic and Germany.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 950, "span_end": 983, "span_text": "Bohemia early in the 10th century", "input_text": "the 10th century", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 849, "span_end": 915, "span_text": " states to hold power there were probably those of Greater Moravia", "input_text": "Greater Moravia", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 900, "span_end": 945, "span_text": "Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century", "input_text": "at the end of the 9th century", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 985, "span_end": 1058, "span_text": "In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state", "input_text": "it was incorporated into the early Polish state", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1064, "span_end": 1123, "span_text": "after its division in the 12th century became a Piast duchy", "input_text": "a Piast duchy", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1181, "span_end": 1230, "span_text": " Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire", "input_text": "the Holy Roman Empire", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1182, "span_end": 1278, "span_text": "Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy", "input_text": "False.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1238, "span_end": 1278, "span_text": "passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy", "input_text": "the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1238, "span_end": 1286, "span_text": "passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526", "input_text": "1526", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 17, "span_end": 45, "span_text": "Silesian German: \"Schl\u00e4sing\"", "input_text": "\"Schl\u00e4sing\"", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 205, "span_end": 236, "span_text": " its population about 8,000,000", "input_text": "about 8,000,000", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 238, "span_end": 277, "span_text": "Silesia is located along the Oder River", "input_text": "the Oder River", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia.", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia.", "input_text": "Two.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia.", "input_text": "Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia.", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 431, "span_end": 488, "span_text": "Silesia's largest city and historical capital is Wroc\u0142aw.", "input_text": "Wroc\u0142aw.", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Silesia.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3w8cv64qj2zqcgwbwokxot5sa7ah9x", "filename": "High-definition_televisionHigh-definition_television_7586b87a26ac3de17e51036a78148a9dbe7e35e7f830fa95c1d989d7", "story": "The term high definition once described a series of television systems originating from August 1936; however, these systems were only high definition when compared to earlier systems that were based on mechanical systems with as few as 30 lines of resolution. The ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true \"HDTV\" spanned the entire 20th century, as each new system became more HD than the last.In the beginning of the 21st century, this race has continued with 4k, 5k and current 8K systems. \n\nThe British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936 and a regular service on 2 November 1936 using both the (mechanical) Baird 240 line sequential scan (later to be inaccurately rechristened 'progressive') and the (electronic) Marconi-EMI 405 line interlaced systems. The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937. In 1938 France followed with their own 441-line system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries. The US NTSC 525-line system joined in 1941. In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable. All of these systems used interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term \"sequential\") and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3. The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 Hz frame rate. The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What can't the video baseband bandwidth be more than?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Whose high-definition TV service first started trials?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did regular service start?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did high definition originally describe?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many lines of resolution did they have?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What drove companies and nations to create true HDTV?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How long did that competition last?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the most current system?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was one of the previous systems in this race?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Whas the Baird 240 scan mechanical or electrical?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was it wrongly known as?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Which system was electronic?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How many lines did it have?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Was it interlaced?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "When did the Brits kill it off?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What country had their own system the next year?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many lines did they have in 1949?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Did it have any color?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What was the aspect ratio used?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1879, "span_end": 1972, "span_text": "an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz", "input_text": "3 MHz", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 517, "span_end": 585, "span_text": "The British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936", "input_text": "The British high-definition TV service", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 517, "span_end": 585, "span_text": "The British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936", "input_text": "August 1936", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 586, "span_end": 626, "span_text": "and a regular service on 2 November 1936", "input_text": "2 November 1936", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 71, "span_text": "The term high definition once described a series of television systems ", "input_text": "A series of television systems", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 188, "span_end": 258, "span_text": "were based on mechanical systems with as few as 30 lines of resolution", "input_text": "30", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 260, "span_end": 335, "span_text": "The ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true \"HDTV\"", "input_text": "Competition", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 261, "span_end": 367, "span_text": "he ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true \"HDTV\" spanned the entire 20th century", "input_text": "The entire 20th century", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 490, "span_end": 515, "span_text": " and current 8K systems.

As he was having dinner in a local cafe one evening, he mentioned the story of his lost teeth to the manager. The manager looked surprised.

They were his. In 1987, an American couple called Jane and Robert Bentley went for a picnic on a beach in California. When they returned home, Mrs. Bentley realized that she had lost her wedding ring. It wasn't a lot of money but it was valuable to Jane Bentley. The Bentleys drove straight back to the beach, and searched for the ring for three hours, but could not find it. A few months later, Mr. Bentley went fishing off the same beach. As he pulled a large crab out of the sea, he noticed that there was something attached to one of its claws. It was his wife's wedding ring! At the end of the 19thcentury, a young woman called Rose Harcourt was on her honeymoon in Barmouth, North Wales, when she lost a gold bracelet her husband had given her as a wedding gift. Feeling very upset, she went straight to the police stations and asked if anyone had found her bracelet. Unfortunately, no one had. Twenty-five years later, the Harcourts returned to Barmouth _ They were sitting on the beach one day when Mrs. Harcourt noticed something gold in the sand by the edge of the sea.

police itself against rumors, and told China Daily that some netizens can't distinguish truth from fiction, \"requiring government departments and website companies to take measures\". \n\nOn Monday,

companies should take legal responsibility when operating their websites.

It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded. \n\nInitially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is JavaScript multi-paradigm?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Does it incorporate API?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "To help work with what?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Anything not included?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Whats an example of that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Can you name others?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is its abbreviation?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is it strongly typed?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How important is it?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is it an integral part of the Internet?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Along with what other languages?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What specification is it based on?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 109, "span_text": "JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm,", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 1004, "span_text": "It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 1004, "span_text": "It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation", "input_text": "text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 1045, "span_text": "It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but does not include any I/O", "input_text": "I/O", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1041, "span_end": 1065, "span_text": " I/O, such as networking", "input_text": "networking", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1041, "span_end": 1098, "span_text": " I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities", "input_text": "storage, or graphics facilities", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS,", "input_text": "JS", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 78, "span_text": "JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 55, "span_text": "JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level", "input_text": "high-level", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 148, "span_end": 257, "span_text": "Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 148, "span_end": 258, "span_text": "Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.", "input_text": "HTML and CSS", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 574, "span_end": 627, "span_text": "JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification", "input_text": "ECMAScript", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "JavaScript.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "32scwg5hih4v7es1hupqdsgh52d6pq", "filename": "mc500.test.132", "story": "Oil is plentiful in West Texas.

week's World Amateur Handicap Championships. \n\nYelton is one of just 13 golfers who have played in all 28 previous editions of the biggest tournament of its type in the world, which brings nearly 3,100 players from 25 countries and 49 states of the U.S. to the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina. \n\nHis streak was nearly broken last year, and in the circumstances nobody would have held it against him if he had taken time out. \n\nJust before the tournament, Martha, his wife of 22 years, was taken ill and passed away just a week later. \n\nThere had been no hint of a problem -- Martha taught at a community school in Shelby in North Carolina and played a bit of golf herself. \n\n\"She mostly just walked the course with me,\" recalled Bob. \n\nHer death hit him hard and he was left

But raising kids takes money and energy. Many older parents find themselves balancing their limited financial resources, decreasing energy and failing health against the growing demands of an active child. Dying and leaving young children is probably the older parents' biggest, and often unspoken fear. \"Having late-life children often means parents, particularly fathers, end up retiring much later. For many, retirement becomes an unobtainable dream.\" says Brandy Gabrielle, an economics professor. \n\nHenry Metcalf, a 54-year-old journalist, knows it takes money to raise kids. But he's also worried that his energy will give out first. Sure, he can still ride bikes with his athletic fifth grader, but he's learned that young at heart doesn't mean young. Lately he's been taking afternoon naps to keep up his energy. \"My body is aging,\" says Metcalf. \"You can't get away from that.\" \n\nOften, older parents hear the ticking of another kind of biological clock. Therapists who work with middle-aged and older parents say fears about aging are nothing to laugh at. \"They worry they'll be mistaken for grandparents, or that they'll need help getting up out of those little chairs in nursery school,\" says Joann Gals, a New York psychologist. But at the core of those little fears there is often a much bigger one: \"that they won't be alive long enough to support and protect their children,\" she says. \n\nMany late-life parents, though, say their children came at just the right time. After marrying late and undergoing years of pregnancy treatment, Marilyn Nolen and her husband, Randy, had twins. \"We both wanted children,\" says Marilyn, who was 55 when she gave birth. The twins have given the couple what they desired for years -- a sense of family. Kids of older dads are often smarter, happier and more sociable because their fathers are more involved in their lives. \"The dads are older, more mature,\" says Dr. Silber, \"and more ready to focus on parenting.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How old is Henry Metcalf?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's he do for a living?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What's it take to raise kids?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Instead of worrying about cash, though, what's he worried about giving out first?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's he like to ride with his fifth grader?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is his kid a couch potato?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's Henry take to keep his energy up?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What's the name of Marilyn Nolan's husband?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many kids do they have?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How old was Marilyn when she had them?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did they want the kids?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What kind of sense did it give them?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When older dudes have kids, what's one of the things the kids tend to be?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Are kids with older dudes for fathers smarter?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Are they happier or sadder than other tykes?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Do their fathers get more involved in their lives?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What's an older's parent biggest, and often unspoken terror?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What turns into an unobtainable dream?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who said this?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What's she do for a living?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 707, "span_end": 736, "span_text": "Henry Metcalf, a 54-year-old ", "input_text": "54", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 722, "span_end": 746, "span_text": "a 54-year-old journalist", "input_text": "journalist", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 747, "span_end": 782, "span_text": " knows it takes money to raise kids", "input_text": "money", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 784, "span_end": 842, "span_text": "But he's also worried that his energy will give out first.", "input_text": "energy", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 843, "span_end": 903, "span_text": "Sure, he can still ride bikes with his athletic fifth grader", "input_text": "bikes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 873, "span_end": 905, "span_text": "with his athletic fifth grader, ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 960, "span_end": 1022, "span_text": ".

Ben was disposed to object to this hiding under the flooring, more especially since he would be enveloped in the sheet, and would doubtless be uncomfortably warm; but all his objections were overruled by the author and company, and he gave a very unwilling assent to the proposition. \n\nIn order that the audience might not be kept waiting until their patience was exhausted, or their good-humor began to evaporate, the curtain was raised as soon as the ghost could be tucked away in his hiding-place, and Paul made his first appearance on any stage. Mopsey had explained to him the part which he was to assume, and in a well-thumbed copy of Shakespeare's works belonging to Mrs. Green he had found the lines which Hamlet is supposed to speak after he sees the ghost. These he had committed to memory, although he had little idea of the meaning of them; and when he came upon the stage he addressed the audience as if in them he saw the ghost of his murdered father.

He said a gap-year experience could be worthwhile for employees and companies. For employees, investing in themselves and improving skill sets is a move that will benefit throughout their career.

He resigned in a dispute with the president, who reinstated an army chief Dahal had fired. \n\nEarlier this month Jhalanath Khanal resigned as prime minister after he was unable to persuade the former Maoist rebels to demobilize and reintegrate their fighters in a deal that was agreeable to the other political parties. \n\nThe Maoists fought a ten-year insurgency from 1996 to 2006 in which about 16,000 people were killed.

Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \"The Warm Heart of Africa\". \n\nMalawi is among the smallest countries in Africa. Lake Malawi takes up about a third of Malawi's area. \n\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland, a protectorate of the United Kingdom, became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a one-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who remained president until 1994, when he lost an election. Arthur Peter Mutharika is the current president. Malawi has a democratic, multi-party government. The country has a Malawian Defence Force that includes an army, a navy and an air wing.

The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of d\u00e9tente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a

It was remarkable that a man as loquacious as Euchre could hold his tongue so long; and this was significant of the deadly nature of the intended deed. During breakfast he said a few words customary in the service of food. At the conclusion of the meal he seemed to come to an end of deliberation. \n\n\"Buck, the sooner the better now,\" he declared, with a glint in his eye. \"The more time we use up now the less surprised Bland'll be.\" \n\n\"I'm ready when you are,\" replied Duane, quietly, and he rose from the table. \n\n\"Wal, saddle up, then,\" went on Euchre, gruffly. \"Tie on them two packs I made, one fer each saddle.

When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement -- against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. \n\nHe left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. \n\nFor the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army.

From 1879 to 2004, \"Index Medicus\" was a comprehensive bibliographic index of such articles in the form of a print index or (in later years) its onscreen equivalent. It was begun by John Shaw Billings, head of the Library of the Surgeon General's Office, United States Army. This library later evolved into the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). In the 1960s, the NLM began the indexing work by creating MEDLARS, a bibliographic database, which became MEDLINE. \"Index Medicus\" thus became the print presentation of the MEDLINE database's content, which users accessed usually by visiting a library which subscribed to \"Index Medicus\" (for example, a university scientist at the university library). It continued in this role through the 1980s and 1990s, while various electronic presentations of MEDLINE's content also evolved, first with proprietary online services (accessed mostly at libraries) and later with CD-ROMs, then with Entrez and PubMed. As users gradually migrated from print to online use, \"Index Medicus\" print subscriptions dwindled. During the 1990s, the dissemination of home internet connections, the launch of the Web and web browsers, and the launch of PubMed greatly accelerated the shift of online access to MEDLINE from something one did at the library to something one did anywhere. This dissemination, along with the superior usability of search compared with use of a print index in serving the user's purpose (which is to distill relevant subsets of information from a vast superset), caused the use of MEDLINE's print output, \"Index Medicus\", to drop precipitously. In 2004, print publication ceased.

Of those, about 1,000 were operational; while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000\u00a0km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000\u00a0km). A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids, and the Sun. \n\nSatellites are used for many purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes.

Dear Simon, You feel ashamed because you should have helped the woman.You are right.Your friends were cruel to that woman.We all want our friend to like us.But we don't have to follow our friends all the time.You're a good boy.You should be strong enough to make up your own mind next time.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are Anorexic people afraid of?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was Sheila worried about?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is Joleen fat?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who felt ashamed for not helping a woman lying on the street?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who was he with?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did Simon's friends tell him not to do?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was Sheila told she should advise Joleen to do?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "And what if she wouldn't do that?", "turn_id": 8}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1029, "span_end": 1041, "span_text": " eating food", "input_text": "eating food", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 67, "span_end": 83, "span_text": "my friend,Joleen", "input_text": "her friend,Joleen", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 84, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "She's thin", "input_text": "She's thin", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 377, "span_end": 382, "span_text": "Simon", "input_text": "Simon", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 639, "span_end": 647, "span_text": "help her", "input_text": "help her", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1051, "span_end": 1082, "span_text": "advise her to see a doctor soon", "input_text": "advise her to see a doctor soon", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1109, "span_end": 1151, "span_text": "should talk to her parents or to a teacher", "input_text": "should talk to her parents or to a teacher", "turn_id": 8}], "name": "middle3626.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3b837j3ldowl6p6d1zwijscophgrso", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/R M Ballantyne___The Lighthouse.txt/CHAPTER THIRTEEN_797aaa948b999dcb437a28c478d6d0f39fe290c773e9aebc177c804", "story": "CHAPTER THIRTEEN. \n\nA SLEEPLESS BUT A PLEASANT NIGHT. \n\nThe evening which followed the day that has just been described was bright, calm, and beautiful, with the starry host unclouded and distinctly visible to the profoundest depths of space. \n\nAs it was intended to send the _Smeaton_ to Arbroath next morning for a cargo of stones from the building-yard, the wrecked party were prevailed on to remain all night on board the _Pharos_, instead of going ashore in one of the ship's boats, which could not well be spared at the time. \n\nThis arrangement, we need hardly say, gave inexpressible pleasure to Ruby, and was not altogether distasteful to Minnie, although she felt anxious about Mrs Brand, who would naturally be much alarmed at the prolonged absence of herself and the captain.

Nevertheless, the German High Command began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 (under the codename Operation Otto), which Adolf Hitler authorized on 18 December 1940. Over the course of the operation, about four million Axis personnel, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare, invaded the western Soviet Union along a front. In addition to troops, the Wehrmacht employed some 600,000 motor vehicles, and between 600,000 and 700,000 horses for non-combat operations. The offensive marked an escalation of the war, both geographically and in the formation of the Allied coalition. \n\nOperationally, German forces achieved major victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union, mainly in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these Axis successes, the German offensive stalled in the Battle of Moscow and subsequently the Soviet winter counteroffensive pushed German troops back. The Red Army absorbed the Wehrmacht's strongest blows and forced the unprepared Germans into a war of attrition. The Wehrmacht would never again mount a simultaneous offensive along the entire strategic Soviet\u2013Axis front.

But a prosecutor said the evidence suggested otherwise. The problem was, the jury was prevented from hearing all the evidence in the case. \n\nWrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, a team of loyal supporters and DNA evidence helped Morton win his freedom in 2011. Last month, Morton's former prosecutor pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause regarding evidence that was not used in the trial. \n\nRead more about Michael Morton's story \n\n2. Brian Banks and the incredible twist \n\nAt age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, college football hopeful Brian Banks followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. \n\nBanks maintained his innocence throughout nearly six years of imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. \n\nBut in 2011, the case took an incredible twist when the alleged victim sent Banks a Facebook friend request. \n\nAccording to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California.

He had, in an instant of impulsive rage, fired his mine prematurely, and, as he feared, impotently. Gabriel had not visibly sickened, faded, nor fallen blighted under the exposure of his wife's deceit. It was even doubtful, as far as Ramirez could judge from his quiet reception of the revelation, whether he would even call that wife to account for it. Again, Ramirez was unpleasantly conscious that this exposure had lost some of its dignity and importance by being wrested from his as a _confession_ made under pressure or duress. Worse than all, he had lost the opportunity of previously threatening Mrs. Conroy with the disclosure, and the delicious spectacle of her discomfiture. In point of fact his revenge had been limited to the cautious cowardice of the anonymous letter-writer, who, stabbing in the dark, enjoys neither the contemplation of the agonies of his victim, nor the assertion of his own individual power. \n\nTo this torturing reflection a terrible suspicion of the Spanish translator, Perkins, was superadded. For Gabriel, Ramirez had only that contempt which every lawless lover has for the lawful husband of his mistress, while for Perkins he had that agonising doubt which every lawless lover has for every other man but the husband.

Most students are enrolled in the five largest faculties, namely Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Management. \n\nMcGill counts among its alumni 12 Nobel laureates and 142 Rhodes Scholars, both the most in Canada, as well as five astronauts, three Canadian prime ministers, 13 justices of the Canadian Supreme Court, four foreign leaders, 28 foreign ambassadors, nine Academy Award (Oscars) winners, 11 Grammy Award winners, three Pulitzer Prize winners, and 28 Olympic medalists, all of varying nationalities. Throughout its long history, McGill alumni were instrumental in inventing or initially organizing football, basketball, and ice hockey.

Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort. Ultimately though, they did install a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an arcade-style joystick could be used optionally.

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis.

He was set to reprise the part in future \"Harry Potter\" films. \n\nKnox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been \"living the dream,\" PA said. \n\nProsecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor's promising life was ended by a \"habitual knife carrier\" who believed stabbing people was an \"occupational hazard\" and had previous convictions for knife crime. \n\nBishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday.

In one of these sallies, when skirting the Christian camp, this arrogant Moor outstripped his companions, overleaped the barriers, and, galloping close to the royal quarters, launched his lance so far within that it remained quivering in the earth close by the pavilions of the sovereigns. The royal guards rushed forth in pursuit, but the Moorish horsemen were already beyond the camp and scouring in a cloud of dust for the city. Upon wresting the lance from the earth a label was found upon it importing that it was intended for the queen. \n\nNothing could equal the indignation of the Christian warriors at the insolence of the bravado and the discourteous insult offered to the queen.

Known as \"Awesome Bill from Dawsonville\", a reference to his Georgia hometown, Elliott won the series top circuit championship in 1988. He was voted NASCAR's most popular driver a record 16 times. \n\nIn 1963, Scott became the only African-American to win a race at NASCAR's highest level, taking a 100-mile feature at Jacksonville, Florida, on December 1. He also was the first African-American to race full time in NASCAR's premier series, called the Grand National Series at the time. \n\nScott made the top 10 in 30% of the races in his 13-year Grand National career. He was portrayed in the 1977 movie \"Greased Lightning\" by Richard Pryor.

It never crossed my mind that it would be twins again.

Experts said that real numbers are probably higher. \n\nThe simulator is basically a computer game. Like many computer games, it was a hit with the students. They lined up and crowded around to watch each other take turns. The simulator has a steering wheel , brake and gas pedals . It is made up of three large computer screens on a table. \n\nStudents choose a distraction, for example driving drunk or driving while texting. They always crash, of course. Then they are pulled over by police, and learn the bad results of their driving: how much damage they've caused, what their fine is, if anyone died in the accident, and if they're going to go to prison. \n\n\"It teaches how to drive without being on the road,\" said Shante Thompson, 16.

A Chinese student had to call 110 for help this week after he got his arm stuck in a toilet trying to rescue his mobile phone. After dropping his phone in the toilet, he decided to wrap(,) his arm in newspaper in the hopes of keeping clean. But the newspapers became larger in size in the water, and then even his roommates couldn't help him pull his arm out. So policemen were called and they spent an hour unsticking the stuck student. Passage 2 Crazy Pet Lovers How much do you love your pets? Many people in China are famous for how much they love their pets. They dress them up in fashionable clothing and buy them high quality food. But would they spend 7,000 English pounds (68,000 yuan) on a wedding for their pets? And that's what a couple in Brazil spent on a fancy wedding for their pet Yorkshire terriers( a kind of dog). Passage 3 Oh, rats! When something goes wrong, you can often hear Westerners cry \"Oh, rats\". But when it comes to Southern China, \"Oh, rats!\" can mean it's what you want for dinner. According to a report in China Daily, some restaurants in Guangzhou serve rat meat. But, actually, most of those rats are field mice. What would Mickey Mouse say? Passage 4 Liar , liar Here's some news that most women already know. Men tell more lies than women. The London Daily Mail cites a new study that says men tell about three lies a day, while women tell only two lies a day. Men are also less likely to feel guilty about lying, according to this week's survey of 3,000 people by a research organization called One Poll. According to the Poll, lying to our mothers is very popular. But then, so is lying at work. And both men and women will lie when it comes to how much they've drunk.

Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. \n\nBefore the 4th century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. During the reign of the Argead king PhilipII (359\u2013336 BC), Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and Thrace through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the \"sarissa\" pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC; Sparta was occupied a century later by Antigonus III Doson. PhilipII's son Alexander the Great, leading a federation of Greek states, accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent campaign of conquest, he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period, his Macedonian empire was the most powerful in the worldthe definitive Hellenistic state, inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy, engineering, and science spread throughout much of the ancient world.

Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association, individual judgment, and self-ownership. \n\nLibertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power. However, they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling to restrict or to dissolve coercive social institutions. \n\nSome libertarians advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights, such as in land, infrastructure, and natural resources. Others, notably libertarian socialists, seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production in favor of their common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. An additional line of division is between minarchists and anarchists. While minarchists think that a minimal centralized government is necessary, anarchists and anarcho-capitalists propose to completely eliminate the state. \n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"libertarian\" was in 1789, when William Belsham wrote about libertarianism in the context of metaphysics. \n\n\"Libertarian\" came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, especially in the political and social spheres, as early as 1796, when the London Packet printed on 12 February: \"Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians.\" The word was again used in a political sense in 1802, in a short piece critiquing a poem by \"the author of Gebir\", and has since been used with this meaning.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was the word \"libertarian\" first used?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "By who?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "In what context?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did the word mean?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And what does the more general \"libertarianism\" mean?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What does it consist of?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do the movements stand for?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What are libertarians skeptic of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Are there different types of libertarians?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is one type?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What do they seek?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is an example of libertarians with opposing views?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When was the London Packet written?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1314, "span_end": 1318, "span_text": "1789", "input_text": "1789", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1325, "span_end": 1340, "span_text": "William Belsham", "input_text": "William Belsham", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1386, "span_end": 1397, "span_text": "metaphysics", "input_text": "metaphysics", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1431, "span_end": 1462, "span_text": "advocate or defender of liberty", "input_text": "advocate or defender of liberty", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 19, "span_end": 26, "span_text": "freedom", "input_text": "freedom", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 48, "span_end": 84, "span_text": "political philosophies and movements", "input_text": "political philosophies and movements", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 97, "span_end": 124, "span_text": "liberty as a core principle", "input_text": "liberty as a core principle", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 320, "span_end": 345, "span_text": "authority and state power", "input_text": "authority and state power", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 361, "span_end": 368, "span_text": "diverge", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 804, "span_end": 826, "span_text": "libertarian socialists", "input_text": "libertarian socialists", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 836, "span_end": 854, "span_text": "abolish capitalism", "input_text": "abolish capitalism", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 859, "span_end": 903, "span_text": "private ownership of the means of production", "input_text": "private ownership of the means of production", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 932, "span_end": 968, "span_text": "cooperative ownership and management", "input_text": "cooperative ownership and management", "turn_id": 13, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1524, "span_end": 1528, "span_text": "1796", "input_text": "1796", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "Libertarianism.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "30jnvc0or9kw4fdxdqvjaovhkhdqhb", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edgar Rice Burroughs___The Beasts of Tarzan.txt/Chapter 1_9ee2200982a44379fc652c479e5faffdef7fb0d07d07d51ab15c237", "story": "Chapter 1 \n\nKidnapped \n\n\"The entire affair is shrouded in mystery,\" said D'Arnot. \"I have it on the best of authority that neither the police nor the special agents of the general staff have the faintest conception of how it was accomplished.

The traditional Spanish folk music called Flamenco could not exist without a guitar. The sound of American blues music would not be the same without the sad cry of the guitar. And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. \n\nMusic experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. \n\nMany famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. \n\nIn the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different. Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music. Listen to this Les Paul recording. It was the fifth most popular song in the United States in 1952.

Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), it exalts a deity of wisdom, Ahura Mazda (\"Wise Lord\"), as its Supreme Being. Major features of Zoroastrianism, such as messianism, heaven and hell, and free will have, some believe, influenced other religious systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam. \n\nWith possible roots dating back to the second millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the 5th-century BCE, and along with a Mithraic Median prototype and a Zurvanist Sassanid successor it served as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires from around 600 BCE to 650 CE. Zoroastrianism was suppressed from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of 633\u2013654. Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 190000, with most living in India and in Iran and their number is declining. Besides the Zoroastrian diaspora, the older Mithraic faith Yazd\u00e2nism is still practised amongst Kurds. \n\nThe most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, which includes the writings of Zoroaster known as the Gathas, enigmatic poems that define the religion's precepts, and the Yasna, the scripture. The full name by which Zoroaster addressed the deity is: Ahura, The Lord Creator, and Mazda, Supremely Wise. The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition, but focused on responsibility, and did not create a devil per-se. Zoroaster proclaimed that there is only one God, the singularly creative and sustaining force of the Universe, and that human beings are given a right of choice, and because of cause and effect are also responsible for the consequences of their choices. The contesting force to Ahura Mazda was called Angra Mainyu, or angry spirit. Post-Zoroastrian scripture introduced the concept of Ahriman, the Devil, which was effectively a personification of Angra Mainyu.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What does Zoroastrianism combine?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What are the most important texts of the religion called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who's writings does it include?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When do it's roots possibly date to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "to which Iranian prophet does it's teachings ascribe to?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When did it serve as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When was it suppressed?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What diety does it exalt?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the current number of Zoroastrians estamated?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many gods does Zoroastrianism beleive in?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What is the contesting force to Ahura Mazda called?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Are there any major features of Zoroastrianism?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Like what?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What are some religion sytems beleived to be influenced by these?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 93, "span_end": 218, "span_text": "combining a cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique [...] among the major religions of the world\"", "input_text": "It combines a cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique [...] among the major religions of the world\"", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1250, "span_end": 1314, "span_text": "The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta", "input_text": "Avesta", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1331, "span_end": 1376, "span_text": "the writings of Zoroaster known as the Gathas", "input_text": "the writings of Zoroaster known as the Gathas", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 588, "span_end": 648, "span_text": "With possible roots dating back to the second millennium BCE", "input_text": "the second millennium BCE", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 220, "span_end": 295, "span_text": "Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra)", "input_text": "Zoroaster (or Zarathustra)", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 790, "span_end": 887, "span_text": " it served as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires from around 600 BCE to 650 CE", "input_text": "from around 600 BCE to 650 CE", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 889, "span_end": 947, "span_text": "Zoroastrianism was suppressed from the 7th century onwards", "input_text": "the 7th century onwards", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 307, "span_end": 373, "span_text": "a deity of wisdom, Ahura Mazda (\"Wise Lord\"), as its Supreme Being", "input_text": "Ahura Mazda (\"Wise Lord\")", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1000, "span_end": 1074, "span_text": "Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 190000", "input_text": "around 190000", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1738, "span_end": 1785, "span_text": "Zoroaster proclaimed that there is only one God", "input_text": "one", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1992, "span_end": 2052, "span_text": "The contesting force to Ahura Mazda was called Angra Mainyu,", "input_text": "Angra Mainyu", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 465, "span_text": "Major features of Zoroastrianism, such as messianism, heaven and hell, and free will have,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 464, "span_text": "Major features of Zoroastrianism, such as messianism, heaven and hell, and free will have", "input_text": "messianism, heaven and hell, and free will have", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 465, "span_end": 585, "span_text": " some believe, influenced other religious systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam.", "input_text": "Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam.", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "Zoroastrianism.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "37c0gnlmhf3mihpbclyvdyzsrdz6dp", "filename": "Spectre_(2015_film)Spectre_(2015_film)_c6d4f699aad7f46d690f6e99b138289fec52daeedec6b5f3caf99131", "story": "Spectre (2015) is the twenty-fourth James Bond film produced by Eon Productions.

The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The Nizami influence can still be seen in the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India.

Tregarva had waited in terrible suspense for many weeks, expecting the explosion which he knew must follow its discovery. He had confided to Lancelot the contents of the paper, and Lancelot had tried many stratagems to get possession of it, but all in vain. Tregarva took this as calmly as he did everything else. Only once, on the morning of the eclaircissement between Lancelot and Argemone, he talked to Lancelot of leaving his place, and going out to seek his fortune; but some spell, which he did not explain, seemed to chain him to the Priory. Lancelot thought it was the want of money, and offered to lend him ten pounds whenever he liked; but Tregarva shook his head. \n\n'You have treated me, sir, as no one else has done--like a man and a friend; but I am not going to make a market of your generosity. I will owe no man anything, save to love one another.' \n\n'But how do you intend to live?' asked Lancelot, as they stood together in the cloisters. \n\n'There's enough of me, sir, to make a good navigator if all trades fail.' \n\n'Nonsense! you must not throw yourself away so.' \n\n'Oh, sir, there's good to be done, believe me, among those poor fellows. They wander up and down the land like hogs and heathens, and no one tells them that they have a soul to be saved. Not one parson in a thousand gives a thought to them.

Along with the Mahabharata, it forms the Sanskrit Itihasa. \n\nThe epic, traditionally ascribed to the Hindu sage Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, the legendary prince of the Kosala Kingdom. It follows his banishment from the kingdom by his father King Dasharatha, his travels across forests in India with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of his wife by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, resulting in a war with him, and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king. \n\nThe \"Ramayana\" is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka meter), divided into seven Kandas (books) and about 500 sargas (chapters). In Hindu tradition, it is considered to be the \"adi-kavya\" (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal wife and the ideal king. \"Ramayana\" was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like \"Mahabharata\", \"Ramayana\" is not just a story: it presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative allegory, interspersing philosophical and ethical elements.

It was not before famous British film director Hitchcock spotted her a decade later that her career took off. \n\nGreatly surprised by her expressive looks, the suspense master cast Fontaine in his first US film, a 1940 adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel \"Rebecca\". She received an Academy Award nomination for her performance as a troubled wife. A year later, Fontaine finally won the long-sought golden figure, for her role as leading lady in \"Suspicion\" opposite Cary Grant, becoming the first and only actress to earn the title for a Hitchock film. \n\nAlthough her sister, Olivia de Havilland, preceded her in gaining Hollywood fame, Fontaine was the first of the sisters to win an Oscar, beating Olivia's nomination as best actress in Mitchell Leisen's \"Hold Back the Dawn\". \n\nThe dislike ,between the sisters was felt at the Oscars ceremony.\"I froze. I stared across the table, where Olivia was sitting.'Get up there!' she whispered commandingly,\" Fontaine said.\"All the dislike we'd felt toward each other as children...all came rushing back in quickly changing pictures...I felt Olivia would spring across the table and seize me by the hair.\" \n\nOlivia did not win her first Oscar until 1946, for her role as the lover of a World War I pilot in Leisen's \" To Each His Own\". Fontaine later made it known that her. sister had slighted her as she attempted to offer congratulations.\"She took one look at me, ignored my hand, seized her Oscar and wheeled away,\" she said. \n\nThe sisters were also reportedly competitors in love. Howard Hughes, a strange businessman who dated the elder de Havilland for a time, offered marriage to Fontaine several times.\"I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be extremely angry because I beat her to it!\" Fontaine once joked. \n\nAs her film career fruited in the 1950s, Fontaine turned to television and dinner theatre, and also appeared in several Broadway productions, including the Lion in Winter\".

Newt Gingrich's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in South Carolina. Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida. The current uncertainty about the race, and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls, is partly due to the fact that we haven't had a debate for a whole month. \n\nIt's important, then, for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before Arizona and Michigan vote on February 28. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism. Same old, same old. But we might see something new from Mitt Romney: a glimmer of humanity. \n\nThe latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. A week ago, polls put Santorum as much as 10 points ahead in the Great Lakes State. But now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and Romney. \n\nSo it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate. This is Rick's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. That's what he's been doing in the western part of the state all this week, where he has hit out repeatedly at Romney's \"well-oiled weathervane\" stance on issues like abortion and Iran.

She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. \n\nCoral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church.

Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help.

She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. \n\nCoral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life. \n\nCoral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait. \n\nThere are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave.

Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. \n\nA feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm\u2014\"in satire, irony is militant\"\u2014but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This \"militant\" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack. \n\nSatire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics. \n\nThe word satire comes from the Latin word \"satur\" and the subsequent phrase \".\" \"Satur\" meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with \"lanx\" shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression \"lanx satura\" literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits.\" \n\nThe word \"satura\" as used by Quintilian, however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as \"satire\".

It could not, surely, have been doubtful to her after she had read that letter,--with the postscript,--that if she remained her happiness would be insured! He would not have come again and insisted on her being there to receive him if nothing were to come of it. And yet she had fought for permission to return to Kingsbury Crescent after her little fashion, and had at last yielded, as she told Lady Albury,--because Sir Harry seemed to wish it. \"Of course he wishes it,\" said Lady Albury. \"He has got the pony on purpose, and nobody likes being disappointed when he has done a thing so much as Sir Harry.\" Ayala, delighted as she was, did not make her secret known. She was fluttered, and apparently uneasy,--so that her friend did not know what to make of it, or which way to take it. Ayala's secret was to herself a secret still to be maintained with holy reticence. It might still be possible that Jonathan Stubbs should never say another word to her of his love. If he did,--why then all the world might know. Then there would be no secret. Then she could sit and discuss her love, and his love, all night long with Lady Albury, if Lady Albury would listen to her. In the meantime the secret must be a secret.

It was introduced by Kodak in 1972. 110 is essentially a miniaturised version of Kodak's earlier 126 film format. Each frame is , with one registration hole. There were 24 frames per cartridge that occasionally enabled the user to capture an extra image due to production variations. \n\nThe film is fully housed in a plastic cartridge, which also registers the image when the film is advanced. There is a continuous backing paper, and the frame number and film type are visible through a window at the rear of the cartridge. The film does not need to be rewound and is very simple to load and unload. It is pre-exposed with frame lines and numbers, a feature intended to make it easier and more efficient for photofinishers to print. \n\nUnlike later competing formats, such as disc and APS film, processed 110 negatives were returned in strips, without the original cartridge. The 110 cartridge was introduced by Kodak in 1972 with Kodak Pocket Instamatic cameras. The new pocket-sized cameras became immediately popular, and soon displaced competing subminiature cameras, such as the Minolta 16 series, from the market. The 110 film width is 16\u00a0mm.

Another story relates that a monk happened to discover that this fruit from the shiny green plant could help him stay awake. \n\nAnother legend gives us the name for coffee, \"mocha\". Omar, an Arabian was thrown to the desert with his followers to die of starvation. In desperation, Omar had his friends boil and eat the fruit from an unknown plant. Not only did the soup save the group, but the residents of the nearest town, Mocha, took their survival as a religious sign. The plant and its beverage were named Mocha to honor this event. \n\nCoffee was introduced much later to countries beyond Arabia, whose inhabitants believed it to be a tasty thing and guarded its secret as if they were top secret military plans. The government forbade transportation of the plant out of the Moslem nations. The actual spread of coffee was started illegally. One Arab named Baba Budan smuggled beans to some mountains near Mysore, India, and started a farm there. Early in this century, some of those original plants were found still growing fruitfully in the region. \n\nCoffee today is grown and enjoyed worldwide, and is one of the few crops that small farmers in third-world countries can profitably export.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did a sheepherder notice when his sheep ate coffee beans?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what kind of effect?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "did he try it himslef?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what happened?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "whaty does the word Mocha derive from?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "why was Omar thrown into the desert?", "turn_id": 6}], "answers": [{"span_start": 230, "span_end": 264, "span_text": "noticed the effect of coffee beans", "input_text": "EFFECT", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 286, "span_end": 306, "span_text": "sheep became excited", "input_text": "sheep became excited", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 389, "span_end": 409, "span_text": "He tried it himself,", "input_text": "YES", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 418, "span_end": 437, "span_text": "soon as overactive ", "input_text": "HE WASoveractive", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 815, "span_end": 819, "span_text": "soup", "input_text": "soup", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 713, "span_text": "to die of starvation", "input_text": "to die", "turn_id": 6}], "name": "high4248.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3ranct1zvfhe5vhsu75syep8srtbu4", "filename": "Eastern_Europe.txt", "story": "Eastern Europe is the eastern part of the European continent.

From 1879 to 2004, \"Index Medicus\" was a comprehensive bibliographic index of such articles in the form of a print index or (in later years) its onscreen equivalent. It was begun by John Shaw Billings, head of the Library of the Surgeon General's Office, United States Army. This library later evolved into the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). In the 1960s, the NLM began the indexing work by creating MEDLARS, a bibliographic database, which became MEDLINE. \"Index Medicus\" thus became the print presentation of the MEDLINE database's content, which users accessed usually by visiting a library which subscribed to \"Index Medicus\" (for example, a university scientist at the university library). It continued in this role through the 1980s and 1990s, while various electronic presentations of MEDLINE's content also evolved, first with proprietary online services (accessed mostly at libraries) and later with CD-ROMs, then with Entrez and PubMed. As users gradually migrated from print to online use, \"Index Medicus\" print subscriptions dwindled. During the 1990s, the dissemination of home internet connections, the launch of the Web and web browsers, and the launch of PubMed greatly accelerated the shift of online access to MEDLINE from something one did at the library to something one did anywhere. This dissemination, along with the superior usability of search compared with use of a print index in serving the user's purpose (which is to distill relevant subsets of information from a vast superset), caused the use of MEDLINE's print output, \"Index Medicus\", to drop precipitously. In 2004, print publication ceased. Today, \"Index Medicus\" and \"Abridged Index Medicus\" still exist conceptually as content curation services that curate MEDLINE content into search subsets or database views (in other words, subsets of MEDLINE records from some journals but not others).

We looked at street signs. Things on the menu.\" \n\nIn the end, comedian Kevin Nealon and his wife decided to name their son Gable. As in Clark Gable. They simply liked the sound of it, and most people will agree it's far better than Helsinki, 43rd Avenue or Never Ending Pasta Bowl. \n\nThis was 4\u00c2\u00bd years ago, but the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star still loves to talk about his son. In 2009, he even published a book about becoming a first-time dad called \"Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?\" \n\n\"We finally got the pacifier away from him,\" Nealon says of Gable. \"And now we're potty training him. It would've been easier to get the pacifier away from him if we taught him how to pee on it.\" \n\nNealon describes himself as a hands-on father but admits, \"It's because I don't work that much.\" \n\nIn that sense, he sort of sounds like his character, Doug Wilson, on Showtime's \"Weeds,\" a pot-smoking, former CPA-drifter with a pretty much nonexistent moral compass. However, as you'll see and hear in our recent video interview, Nealon and Doug Wilson are really nothing alike. \n\n\"I have a lot of hobbies, and I have a lot of friends,\" he says. \"And I'm not so insecure as Doug.\" \n\nThey have even greater differences, but everyone still loves Doug. For all his faults and failures, fans just can't get enough of the self-centered, shamed city councilman of fictional Agrestic, and he has become, perhaps, Nealon's most beloved character on TV.

Andes and Klinger were able to set up their phones to send multiple messages. During a February test run they found they could send 6,000 or 7,000 messages on some days, prompting the March messaging marathon. \" Most were either short phrases or one word, 'LOL' or 'Hello', things like that , with tons and tons of repeats,\" said Andes, reached by phone.

The National Cryptologic Museum is on Fort George G. Meade, a military base near Washington, DC. The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding. People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information. The National Cryptologic Museum celebrated 60 years of cryptologic excellence in 2012. One event there marked the sixtieth anniversary of the National Security Agency. Two former NSA workers shared their memories of operating a code machine called Sigaba. \n\nIn 1940, an American woman named Genevieve Grotjan found some information being repeated in Japanese coded messages. Her discovery helped the United States understand secret Japanese diplomatic messages. After the United States understood the code, it was possible to study messages from the Japanese ambassador to Germany and to his supervisors in Japan. \n\nUnderstanding these messages helped the United States prepare for a possible war in the Pacific with Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor. the American naval commander in the Pacific Ocean was Chester Nimitz. His forces were much smaller than the Japanese Naval forces. And the Japanese had been winning many victories. Joseph Rochefort had worked for several months to read the secret Japanese Naval code called JN-25. If he could understand enough of the code, he would be able to give Admiral Nimitz very valuable information. \n\nFrom the beginning of 1942, the Japanese code discussed a place called \"AF.\" Joseph Rochefort felt the Japanese were planning an important battle aimed at \"AF.\" After several weeks, he and other naval experts told Admiral Nimitz that their best idea was that the \"AF\" in the Japanese code was the American-held island of Midway. Admiral Nimitz said he must have more information to prepare for such an attack. \n\nThe Navy experts decided to trick Japan. They told the American military force on Midway to broadcast a false message. The message would say the island was having problems with its water-processing equipment. The message asked that fresh water be sent to the island immediately. This message was not sent in code. \n\nSeveral days later, a Japanese radio broadcast in the JN-25 code said that \"AF\" had little water. Joseph Rochefort had the evidence he needed. \"AF\" was now known to be the island of Midway. He also told Admiral Nimitz the Japanese would attack Midway on June 13.The battle that followed was a huge American victory. That victory was possible because Joseph Rochefort learned to read enough of the Japanese code to discover the meaning of the letters \"AF.\" \n\nOne American code has never been broken. Perhaps it never will. It was used in the Pacific during World War Two. For many years the government would not discuss this secret code. Listen for a moment to this very unusual code. Then you may understand why the Japanese military forces were never able to understand any of it. \n\nThe code is in the voice of a Native American. The man you just heard is singing a simple song in the Navajo language. Very few people outside the Navajo nation are able to speak any of their very difficult language. \n\nAt the beginning of World War Two, the United States Marine Corps asked members of the Navajo tribe to train as Code Talkers. \n\nThe Cryptologic Museum says the Marine Corps Code Talkers could take a sentence in English and change it into their language in about 20 seconds. A code machine needed about 30 minutes to do the same work. \n\nThe Navajo Code Talkers took part in every battle the Marines entered in the Pacific during World War Two. The Japanese were very skilled at breaking codes. But they were never able to understand any of what they called \"The Marine Code.\" \n\nThe Cryptologic Museum has many pieces of mechanical and electric equipment used to change words into code. It also has almost as many examples of machines used to try to change code back into useful words.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Have secret codes been used long?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's their purpose?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did the Navy trick Japan?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was the message they sent true?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was in sent in some kind of secret fashion?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What place is now known to be AF?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is there a message nobody has figured out?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is it really strange?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What language is it in?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is it tricky for most people to learn?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 164, "span_end": 246, "span_text": "People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 110, "span_end": 245, "span_text": "The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding.

Some linguists use \"vernacular\" and \"nonstandard dialect\" as synonyms. \n\nThe use of \"vernacular\" is not recent.

According to Merriam-Webster, \"vernacular\" was brought into the English language as early as 1601 from the Latin \"vernaculus\" (\"native\") which had been in figurative use in Classical Latin as \"national\" and \"domestic\", having originally been derived from \"vernus\" and \"verna\", a male or female slave respectively born in the house rather than abroad. The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words \"vernaculus, vernacula\".

Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, and from 10\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edge\u00f8ya. \n\nAdministratively, the archipelago is not part of any Norwegian county, but forms an unincorporated area administered by a governor appointed by the Norwegian government. Since 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, Longyearbyen, has had an elected local government, somewhat similar to mainland municipalities. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research station of Ny-\u00c5lesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. Ny-\u00c5lesund is the northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population. Other settlements are farther north, but are populated only by rotating groups of researchers. \n\nThe islands were first taken into use as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles.

At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \"Mumbet\" or \"Mum Bett.\" \n\nFor nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. \n\nWhile serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. \n\nStrangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B.

Although he died in 1616, people still go to see his plays. Among the most popular are Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet -- the story of a prince who struggles to respond to the crimes around him. Shakespeare, who was born in 1564, was an actor as well as a writer. Most of his ideas for plays were taken from history, people's conversation, ancient stories, and also from other writers. He wrote not only about kings and queens and princes, but also about friends and ordinary people. He wrote about the cruelty of war and the bravery of heroes, as well as about jealousy, joy, hate, ambition and love. His stories live on. The tragedy Romeo and Juliet was reborn as the musical West Side Story and more recently as the movie Romeo and Juliet with the wonderful performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. He invented a number of great characters: powerful magicians, thrilling witches, smart women and both wise and wicked men. He also invented some great phrases. If you've ever said, \"Oh, for goodness sake!\" you can thank Shakespeare for that. \"To be, or not to be: that is the question,\" Hamlet says. \"Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it is morrow,\" says Juliet to her Romeo. Don't be surprised if you don't understand everything when reading Shakespeare or watching one of his plays because the meanings of many words have changed over the years. And Shakespeare's characters speak in poetry, so their speeches can be complicated. It does help to find out a little bit about the story before reading a Shakespeare play. It's worth the effort.

It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. \n\nHistorically, manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon. \n\nManganese phosphating is used for rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries. \n\nIn biology, manganese(II) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts.

Baptism has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations. \n\nThe usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the candidate to be immersed, either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). While John the Baptist's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, \"The fact that he chose a permanent and deep river suggests that more than a token quantity of water was needed, and both the preposition 'in' (the Jordan) and the basic meaning of the verb 'baptize' probably indicate immersion. In v. 16, Matthew will speak of Jesus 'coming up out of the water'. The traditional depiction in Christian art of John the Baptist pouring water over Jesus' head may therefore be based on later Christian practice.\" Pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body.

However, that doesn't mean he or she will live a proud and happy life ever after, as Katniss Everdeen is about to discover in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. \n\nCatching Fire, out in Chinese theaters on Nov 21, is set in a futuristic society called Panem. Every year its government holds a televised fight to the death. Two teenagers from each of the 12 districts of Panem are chosen to compete. \n\nIn the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life. However, that never seems to happen. She has nightmares, which remind her that she is a killer. \n\nHer worst nightmare comes true when the annual Hunger Games arrive again. The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \n\n\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\" Lawrence told Reuters. \n\nFast-paced and full of action, Catching Fire looks to outdo the success that the first film had in 2012. With a 97 percent rating on the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes, it is enjoying positive reviews. Critics have praised it for being faithful to the book written by American author Suzanne Collins. The Hollywood Reporter said that Catching Fire outshines the first movie a lot. \n\nJennifer Lawrence, who won a best actress Oscar this year for her 2012 movie Silver Linings Playbook, has helped Catching Fire find success, Forbes pointed out. The 23-year-old actress does well playing a young lady who hates what she was forced to do to stay alive yet is determined not to give up. \n\n\"Lawrence's down-to-earth personality in real life won the hearts of the public.

It developed from a system produced by Thomas Wade, during the mid-19th century, and was given completed form with Herbert A. Giles's \"Chinese\u2013English Dictionary\" of 1892. \n\nWade\u2013Giles was the system of transcription in the English-speaking world for most of the 20th century, used in standard reference books and in English language books published before 1979. It replaced the Nanking dialect-based romanization systems that had been common until the late 19th century, such as the Postal Romanization (still used in some place-names). In mainland China it has been entirely replaced by the Hanyu Pinyin system approved in 1958. Outside mainland China, it has mostly been replaced by P\u012bny\u012bn, even though Taiwan implements a multitude of Romanization systems in daily life.

Followers of Jainism take five main vows: \"ahimsa\" ('non-violence'), \"satya\" ('truth'), \"asteya\" ('not stealing'), \"brahmacharya\" ('celibacy', 'chastity'), and \"aparigraha\" ('non-attachment'). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. \"Parasparopagraho Jivanam\" ('the function of souls is to help one another') is the motto of Jainism.

Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviors and teachers known as Tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who is believed to have lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the Mahavira around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal \"dharma\" with the Tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology. \n\nJainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Svetambaras; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE.

Marston, leaning on the rail, watched her approach, and his look was thoughtful when he turned to Wyndham. \n\n\"If Don Ramon got our telegram, he's probably on board,\" he said. \"I hope he is, because if he doesn't come it might imply he means to make things difficult for us. He could if he liked.\" \n\n\"Larrinaga will come,\" Wyndham replied. \"From all accounts, he's a pretty good officer, but I don't expect he neglects his interests while he looks after the State's. I'm counting on this.\" \n\n\"I s'pose one mustn't be fastidious, but I don't want to get involved in fresh intrigue. The job we've undertaken is awkward enough.\" \n\n\"Very awkward,\" Wyndham agreed, with some dryness. \"In a way, it looks too big for us. To begin with, we have got to pay duties we dodged, and satisfy the Government we cheated. Then, without exciting the latter's curiosity, we're going to stop a rebellion and carry off its leader. There's the worst puzzle. The fellow's cunning and powerful. Moreover, he's my uncle.\" \n\nHe stopped, for the engines clanked noisily as the screw turned astern; then the anchor splashed and the launch swung in to the gangway. The port doctor came on board and after him a man in tight-fitting American clothes. His wide black belt was spun from the finest silk and Marston noted his hat.

Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude, and elevation are defined. \n\nIn 1687 Isaac Newton published the Principia in which he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution which he termed an oblate spheroid. Current practice uses the word 'ellipsoid' alone in preference to the full term 'oblate ellipsoid of revolution' or the older term 'oblate spheroid'. In the rare instances (some asteroids and planets) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is triaxial (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-GPS) ellipsoids are centred at the actual center of mass of the Earth or body being modeled. \n\nThe shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that ellipse which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The semi-major axis of the ellipse, \"a\", is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the semi-minor axis of the ellipse, \"b\", is identified with the polar distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the \"inverse \"flattening, , The flattening, \"f\", is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: For the Earth, \"f\" is around corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately .

In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves. \n\nAlbert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A.

If you live longer, then you cost the health system more.\" \n\nThe researchers found that from age 20 to 56, obese people racked up the most expensive health costs. But on average, healthy people lived 84 years. Smokers lived about 77 years, and obese people lived about 80 years. Smokers and obese people tended to have more heart disease than healthy people. Therefore in the long run, the thin and healthy group cost about $417, 000, from age 20 on.

THE NUPTIALS OF RUTH WESTMACOTT \n\nHere was Sir Rowland Blake in high fettle at knowing himself armed with a portentous weapon for the destruction of Anthony Wilding. Upon closer inspection of it, however, he came to realize--as Richard had realized earlier--that it was double-edged, and that the wielding of it must be fraught with as much danger for Richard as for their common enemy. For to betray Mr. Wilding and the plot would scarce be possible without betraying young Westmacott, and that was unthinkable, since to ruin Richard--a thing he would have done with a light heart so far as Richard was himself concerned--would be to ruin his own hopes of winning Ruth. \n\nTherefore, during the days that followed, Sir Rowland was forced to fret in idleness what time his wound was healing; but if his arm was invalided, his eyes and ears were sound, and he remained watchful for an opportunity to apply the knowledge he had gained. Richard mentioned the subject no more, so that Blake almost came to wonder whether the boy remembered what in his cups he had betrayed. \n\nMeanwhile Mr. Wilding moved serene and smiling on his way. Daily there were great armfuls of flowers deposited at Lupton House--his lover's offering to his mistress--and no day went by but that some richer gift accompanied them. Now it was a collar of brilliants, anon a rope of pearls, again a priceless ring that had been Mr. Wilding's mother's. Ruth received with reluctance these pledges of his undesired affection. It were idle to reject them, considering that she was to marry him; yet it hurt her sorely to retain them. On her side she made no dispositions for the marriage, but went about her daily tasks as though she were to remain a maid at Lupton House for a time as yet indefinite.

People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted'. The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance.

As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. \n\nHitler was born in Austria\u2014then part of Austria-Hungary\u2014and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. While in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto \"Mein Kampf\" (\"My Struggle\"). Released in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. \n\nBy 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag and led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. He aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who's the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What war did he initiate?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where was he born?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "On what date?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What part was the place where he was born a part of then?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who raised him?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was he raised?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did he move to Germany?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What organization did he join in 1919?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Of what organization was that one a precursor?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What military branch did he serve in around that time?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was he in any war?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where did he try and take over in a failed coup?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What was his punishment?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What did he do while locked up?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When was it released?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 12, "span_text": "Adolf Hitler", "input_text": "Adolf Hitler", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 277, "span_end": 306, "span_text": "Hitler initiated World War II", "input_text": "World War II", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 400, "span_end": 426, "span_text": "Hitler was born in Austria", "input_text": "Austria", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 16, "span_end": 29, "span_text": "20 April 1889", "input_text": "20 April 1889", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 400, "span_end": 455, "span_text": "Hitler was born in Austria\u2014then part of Austria-Hungary", "input_text": "Austria-Hungary", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 460, "span_end": 480, "span_text": "was raised near Linz", "input_text": "near Linz", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 482, "span_end": 509, "span_text": "He moved to Germany in 1913", "input_text": "1913", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 583, "span_end": 632, "span_text": "n 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP)", "input_text": "the German Workers' Party (DAP)", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 634, "span_end": 660, "span_text": "the precursor of the NSDAP", "input_text": "the NSDAP", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 550, "span_end": 580, "span_text": "the German Army in World War I", "input_text": "the German Army", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 550, "span_end": 580, "span_text": "the German Army in World War I", "input_text": "World War I", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 709, "span_end": 791, "span_text": "In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned", "input_text": "Munich", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 709, "span_end": 791, "span_text": "In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned", "input_text": "In 1923", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 718, "span_end": 791, "span_text": "he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned", "input_text": "he was imprisoned", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 793, "span_end": 856, "span_text": "While in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography", "input_text": "he dictated the first volume of his autobiography", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 911, "span_end": 927, "span_text": "Released in 1924", "input_text": "in 1924", "turn_id": 17}], "name": "Adolf_Hitler.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3tayzsbpll8425psm9hhik4gc9n2sa", "filename": "middle5627.txt", "story": "Jack had gone to the university to study history, but he kept playing all the time and at the end of his first year, his history professor failed him in his exams.

He was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still and count his bruises. He instantly wrote to Madame de Cintre, relating to her the circumstances of her brother's death--with certain exceptions--and asking her what was the earliest moment at which he might hope that she would consent to see him. M. Ledoux had told him that he had reason to know that Valentin's will--Bellegarde had a great deal of elegant personal property to dispose of--contained a request that he should be buried near his father in the church-yard of Fleurieres, and Newman intended that the state of his own relations with the family should not deprive him of the satisfaction of helping to pay the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world. He reflected that Valentin's friendship was older than Urbain's enmity, and that at a funeral it was easy to escape notice. Madame de Cintre's answer to his letter enabled him to time his arrival at Fleurieres. This answer was very brief; it ran as follows:-- \n\n\"I thank you for your letter, and for your being with Valentin. It is a most inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be nothing but a distress to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for what you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no brighter days.

Huddled together in the dining room and waiting for the sun to rise, none of us had any notion that a way of life had ended.

Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said in a video that he was going to sell them into slavery, but it's unknown whether he has. Pentagon spokesman U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby and other officials have said they believe the girls may have been separated into smaller groups, making the task of finding them inordinately more difficult. Gordon Brown, a former UK prime minister and the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, speculated that the girls may have been moved into neighboring countries. \"The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,\" he said. \n\nWhat's being done to find them? \n\nNigeria hasn't given a lot of information about its efforts other than to say that its soldiers have been out in the field, looking for the girls.

Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. \n\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. \n\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. \n\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did the sign language begin?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How did deaf people communicate before that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What were those exactly?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Why couldn't they just take a class on it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who was Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was he successful?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did he do after that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What happened while he was over there?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What method did Britain use?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was different about the French?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did he think about it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who did he meet there?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was there anyone else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Were they instructors also?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who were they?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was he able to learn their method?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Did he go back to Ameria after that?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How long did that take?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "Did he ever start a school?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 22}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 23}], "answers": [{"span_start": 112, "span_end": 146, "span_text": "the history really begins in 1817.", "input_text": "1817", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 147, "span_end": 205, "span_text": "Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\"", "input_text": "by using \"home signs\"", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 207, "span_end": 292, "span_text": "Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication.", "input_text": "Gestures were created and used within each home.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 293, "span_end": 362, "span_text": "There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf.

It was, however, not a very interesting battle; and it was not clear who really won it, nor are wars of this time very easy to understand. \n\nThe battle of Fontenoy was fought in the course of a great war to decide who would be emperor of Germany, in which France and England took different sides; and this made Charles Edward Stuart, the eldest son of James, think it was a good moment for trying once again to get back the crown of his forefathers. He was a fine-looking young man, with winning manners, and a great deal more spirit than his father: and when he landed in Scotland with a very few followers, one Highland gentleman after another was so delighted with him that they all brought their clans to join him, and he was at the head of quite a large force, with which he took possession of the town of Edinburgh; but he never could take the castle. The English army was most of it away fighting in Germany, and the soldiers who met him at Prestonpans, close to Edinburgh, were not well managed, and were easily beaten by the Highlanders. Then he marched straight on into England: and there was great terror, for the Highlanders--with their plaids, long swords, and strange language--were thought to be all savage robbers, and the Londoners expected to have every house and shop ruined and themselves murdered: though on the whole the Highlanders behaved very well. They would probably have really entered London if they had gone on, and reached it before the army could come home, but they grew discontented and frightened at being so far away from their own hills; and at Derby. Charles Edward was obliged to let them turn back to Scotland.

He ought perhaps to take steps; but to take steps would be deplorable. \n\nWithout an open scandal which they could not see their way to recommending, it was difficult to see what steps could be taken.

Elena's parents had moved from Greece to Australia, and her grandparents still lived on the small Greek island of Santorini, When she was 16, Elena visited her grandparents for the first time. On returning to Australia, she talked endlessly about her grandmother's next-door neighbor, Mara. When Christine expressed puzzlement at Elena's obsession with people next door, Elena admitted that Maria had a handsome son called Nicos. She showed Christine a photo of him, standing next to his prize possession, a motorbike. Elena and Nicos exchanged emails for a while, but suddenly Nicos stopped writing. While not heartbroken, Elena was nevertheless hurt. A year later, when Christine announced that she was going to visit Greece, Elena begged her to visit Santorini and say hello to Maria and Nicos. Christine agreed to do so. \n\nWhen she flew into Athens on an unseasonably cold day in September, she quickly realized that she hadn't brought enough warm clothes. Walking through the streets of the Greek capital, she happened to see a nice coat in a shop window and went in to ask about the price. The coat was too expensive, but as Christine was about to leave the shop, the woman asked her where she was from. When Christine answered Australia, the woman agreed to reduce the price because she knew a nice girl from Australia called Elena. Christine then noticed a photo of a young man standing next to a motorbike. Her eyes opened wide with astonishment. It was Nicos! Indeed the young man was Nicos, and the woman in the shop was Maria. She had come to Athens from Santorini to look after the shop for a friend. \n\nSadly, the story has a tragic ending. Nicos had been killed in a motorcycle accident. \n\n\"I wanted to tell Elena,\" said Maria. \"But I didn't know how.

Tom took Ruth with him, not only because it was a great pleasure to him to have her for his companion whenever he could, but because he wished her to cherish and comfort poor Merry; which she, for her own part (having heard the wretched history of that young wife from Tom), was all eagerness to do. \n\n'She was so glad to see me,' said Tom, 'that I am sure she will be glad to see you.

Mr. Cax-Puluc, who had barely began to live his life, he died that day. It's not lost on the court, and probably yourself, that today an officer has fallen because you were a law enforcement officer entrusted with so many responsibilities.\" \n\nHunter and the defendant, who both worked at the Dekalb County Courthouse, knew each other, prosecutors have said. \n\nYancey was convicted earlier this month of two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. \n\nCax-Puluc and Linda Yancey were shot multiple times in the Yanceys' home in Stone Mountain. \n\nThe defendant told police that he shot Cax-Puluc in self-defense after the day laborer had shot his wife.

The parting at Richmond was very painful, and Lady Fawn had declared herself quite unable to make another journey up to London with the ungrateful runagate. Though there was no diminution of affection among the Fawns, there was a general feeling that Lucy was behaving badly. That obstinacy of hers was getting the better of her. Why should she have gone? Even Lord Fawn had expressed his desire that she should remain. And then, in the breasts of the wise ones, all faith in the Greystock engagement had nearly vanished. Another letter had come from Mrs. Hittaway, who now declared that it was already understood about Portray that Lady Eustace intended to marry her cousin. This was described as a terrible crime on the part of Lizzie, though the antagonistic crime of a remaining desire to marry Lord Fawn was still imputed to her. And, of course, the one crime heightened the other. So that words from the eloquent pen of Mrs. Hittaway failed to make dark enough the blackness of poor Lizzie's character.

Its formula can be written also as \u2212\u2212 or \u2212 (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH. Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is used as a drug and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. \n\nEthanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes, and is most commonly considered as a popular recreational drug. It also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant. The compound is widely used as a chemical solvent, either for scientific chemical testing or in synthesis of other organic compounds, and is a vital substance utilized across many different kinds of manufacturing industries. Ethanol is also used as a clean energy burning fuel source. \n\n\"Ethanol\" is the systematic name defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) for a compound consisting of alkyl group with two carbon atoms (prefix \"eth-\"), having a single bond between them (infix \"-an-\"), attached functional group-OH group (suffix \"-ol\"). \n\nThe \"eth-\" prefix and the qualifier \"ethyl\" in \"ethyl alcohol\" originally come from the name \"ethyl\" assigned in 1834 to the group - by Justus Liebig.
