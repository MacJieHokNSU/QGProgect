The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum. \n\nThe quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20%. Much higher-quality vacuums are possible. Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10\u221212) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm3. Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average. According to modern understanding, even if all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be \"empty\" due to vacuum fluctuations, dark energy, transiting gamma rays, cosmic rays, neutrinos, and other phenomena in quantum physics. In the electromagnetism in the 19th century, vacuum was thought to be filled with a medium called aether. In modern particle physics, the vacuum state is considered the ground state of matter.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What does a vacuum not have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where does the word come from?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What language is that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what does it mean?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is that an adverb?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do physicists call vacuum?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What do they call a vacuum that's not perfect?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How does pressure in a vacuum compare to pressure in the atmosphere?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What does a household vacuum do to air pressure?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "by how much?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is outer space a vacuum?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How many hydrogen atoms or in a cubic meter out there?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "would something be empty if there was no matter in it?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is vacuum one of them?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What's another one?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did they once believe was in a vacuum?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When did they think this?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 30, "span_text": "Vacuum is space void of matter", "input_text": "matter", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 32, "span_end": 101, "span_text": "The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\"", "input_text": "vacuus", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 52, "span_end": 79, "span_text": "the Latin adjective vacuus ", "input_text": "Latin", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 71, "span_end": 101, "span_text": " vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\"", "input_text": "vacant or void", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 52, "span_end": 79, "span_text": "the Latin adjective vacuus ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 51, "span_end": 78, "span_text": " the Latin adjective vacuus", "input_text": "adjective", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 208, "span_end": 331, "span_text": "Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\"", "input_text": "a perfect vacuum", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 290, "span_end": 345, "span_text": "which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or free space", "input_text": "free space", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 355, "span_end": 418, "span_text": "the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum ", "input_text": "partial vacuum", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 556, "span_end": 604, "span_text": "he pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure.

A silent and motionless officer stood out some twenty paces in front of his silent and motionless men. Further, they could see that he wore a very high and singular head-dress. They were still rushing forward, breathless with apprehension, when to their horror this head-dress began to lengthen and broaden, and a great bird flapped heavily up and dropped down again on the nearest tree-trunk. Then they knew that their worst fears were true, and that it was the garrison of Poitou which stood before them. \n\nThey were lashed to low posts with willow withies, some twenty of them, naked all, and twisted and screwed into every strange shape which an agonised body could assume. In front where the buzzard had perched was the gray-headed commandant, with two cinders thrust into his sockets and his flesh hanging from him like a beggar's rags. Behind was the line of men, each with his legs charred off to the knees, and his body so haggled and scorched and burst that the willow bands alone seemed to hold it together. For a moment the four comrades stared in silent horror at the dreadful group. Then each acted as his nature bade him. De Catinat staggered up against a tree-trunk and leaned his head upon his arm, deadly sick. Du Lhut fell down upon his knees and said something to heaven, with his two clenched hands shaking up at the darkening sky.

The house was similar in style to the one at Bridges Creek, and stood on a rising ground overlooking a meadow which bordered the Rappahannock. This was the home of George's boyhood; the meadow was his play-ground, and the scene of his early athletic sports; but this home, like that in which he was born, has disappeared; the site is only to be traced by fragments of bricks, china, and earthenware. \n\nIn those days the means of instruction in Virginia were limited, and it was the custom among the wealthy planters to send their sons to England to complete their education. This was done by Augustine Washington with his eldest son Lawrence, then about fifteen years of age, and whom he no doubt considered the future head of the family. George was yet in early childhood: as his intellect dawned he received the rudiments of education in the best establishment for the purpose that the neighborhood afforded.

She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers or posters. Then I thought of replacing them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said. To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows. In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display wall to show students' works. Through the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun. I can design my own patterns and present interesting things through it,\" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies . Paper cutting also helps students become more patient.

Tim's hugs are doubly special because of everything he has achieved. The 26-year-old is probably the only Down syndrome sufferer in the U.S. to own a restaurant,but he has several other things to be proud of-- he's a skillful special Olympian, an excellent sailor, and all experienced fisherman. He was also chosen as Homecoming King and Student of the Year in high school! So when a man like Tim hugs you,it is sure to be a special and unforgettable experience When Tim expressed interest in opening a restaurant,Keith,a small businessman himself, supported him. Tim hired other people to manage the place and do the cooking, and he introduced the idea of free hugs. He realized that people want to feel at home at a restaurant. That is why he included \"love\" as all item on the menu. Customers can order the free hug from Tim,and even if they don't, he'll probably hug them anyway. The restaurant has been around since 2010,and Tim has given out over 19,000 hugs in the past five years -- he keeps count using a special Hug Counter.Many customers love visiting \"Tim's Place\". \"I've been coming here once a week.\" said Michelle Garth-Jones, a regular customer. \"I love local restaurants, and this special one has a story that stays with you.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is common among restaurant owners?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who owns \"Tim's place?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was different about him?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "to who?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "when?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What do customers call the place?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is special about the menu?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "HOw old is Tim?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Does he have any skills?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How did he do in high school?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What happens if someone doesn't order a hig?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is it memorable?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did Tim suffer from anything?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "HOw do people describe the atmosphere?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who supported him in opening the place?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "named?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who did he hire?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What did he introduce them to?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 72, "span_text": "While it is common for restaurant owners to connect with their customers", "input_text": "connecting with their customers", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 74, "span_end": 152, "span_text": "a restaurant owner in the U.S. is taking it to a whole new level.

It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, the Dutch Caribbean ABC islands to the north and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela covers and has over 31 million (31,775,371) people. The country has extremely high biodiversity (ranked 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \"llanos\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. \n\nThe territory now known as Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence, which was not securely established until 1821, when Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It gained full independence as a separate country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional \"caudillos\" (military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993.

Although these glasses worked, scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see. They thought that eyes sent out light onto whatever a person was looking at, and then the light came back to the eyes. Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked.

gesture during a league game by an English court. \n\nColin Kazim-Richards, who represented Turkey at the 2008 European Championship finals, was convicted following the incident while he was playing

coast of England around 50 miles from London, has a large gay population and its players and supporters have often been subjected to homophobic abuse. \n\nOn Tuesday, Sussex Police reported that three people were arrested for homophobic chanting during Brighton's game at Leicester. \n\nKazim-Richards, who had previously played for Brighton between 2005-2006, made the gesture after being taunted by home supporters who claimed he was overweight. \n\nDarren Hastings, a witness in the trial, said he noticed Kazim-Richards make the gesture four or five times during the match. \n\n\"It was utterly

She lived a simple life. She seldom travelled. She never married and she died from illness when she was only 41. \n\nHowever, people all over the world remember her. Why? It is because Jane Austen is the author of some of the best-loved novels in the English language. These novels include Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. \n\nJane completed her last novel Persuasion in 1816, but it was not published until after her death. Persuasion is partly based on Jane's naval brother. \n\nAnne, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, falls in love with Captain Wentworth, a person of a lower social position. But she breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. Eight years later, Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain. He finds Anne's family on the edge of financial ruin. Anne and the captain rediscover their love and get married. \n\nJane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory , two inches square. Readers of Persuasion will see that neither her skill of delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus to English manners and morals has abandoned her in her final finished work. \n\nPersuasion has produced three film adaptations: a 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, a 2007 TV miniseries with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, and a 1971 miniseries with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall. \n\nPeople who are interested in Jane Austen can still visit many of the places she visited and lived.

Charles Darwin popularised the term \"natural selection\", and compared it with artificial selection. \n\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves. Factors that affect reproductive success are also important, including sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection. \n\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, or the observable characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 144\u00a0million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern; about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world; other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. \n\nExtending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. \n\nThe East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium.

his name and said he has cooperated with investigators from both England and South Africa. \n\nDewali's solicitor, Andrew Katzen, said he was \"delighted\" with the outcome but declined further

Everybody was free to come in. Wine-butts were broached in all the courts; the pickled meat prepared in such lots for the siege was distributed among the people, who crowded to congratulate their beloved sovereign on his victory; and the Prince, as was customary with that good man, who never lost an opportunity of giving a dinner-party, had a splendid entertainment made ready for the upper classes, the whole concluding with a tasteful display of fireworks. \n\nIn the midst of these entertainments, our old friend the Count of Hombourg arrived at the castle. The stalwart old warrior swore by Saint Bugo that he was grieved the killing of the Rowski had been taken out of his hand. The laughing Cleves vowed by Saint Bendigo, Hombourg could never have finished off his enemy so satisfactorily as the unknown knight had just done. \n\nBut who was he? was the question which now agitated the bosom of these two old nobles. How to find him--how to reward the champion and restorer of the honor and happiness of Cleves? They agreed over supper that he should be sought for everywhere. Beadles were sent round the principal cities within fifty miles, and the description of the knight advertised, in the Journal de Francfort and the Allgemeine Zeitung. The hand of the Princess Helen was solemnly offered to him in these advertisements, with the reversion of the Prince of Cleves's splendid though somewhat dilapidated property.

Our hearts ached as we heard the cries of the injured, as we watched surgeons performed amputations without general anesthesia, as people died in front of our eyes. \n\nBut, in the midst of this despair, a miracle arrived at Project Medishare. CNN Senior Photographer Ferre Dollar caught these images seconds after she arrived. Look closely at the center of the photo. \n\nThis 4-month-old baby had spent four days alone in the rubble and was unconscious and extremely dehydrated. No one knew if she would live or die. \n\nBut look at her now! \n\nCNN medical producer John Bonifield and I had the pure joy of seeing this wonderful young lady again last week. Her name is Jenny, and she's 5 years old and a pre-kindergartner in Miami. She can write her name and loves to color and dress up as a princess and is adorable and spunky and smart and funny. \n\nHere are all the miracles that it took to save her life: \n\n1. That someone happened to find Jenny in the rubble four days after the quake. \n\n2. That at a time when vehicles were in short supply, Jenny's rescuers flagged down a car to rush her to the hospital. \n\n3. That the Medishare team of doctors and nurses, led by Dr. Karen Schneider, an emergency medicine physician at Johns Hopkins, managed to get fluids into her. Jenny was so dehydrated her veins had collapsed and Schneider had to put a needle through her shinbone and directly into her bone marrow to deliver fluids. They didn't have to sedate her -- Jenny was so unconscious she didn't even cry.

The republics of Serbia and Montenegro together established a federation in 1992 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY or FR Yugoslavia; \"Savezna Republika Jugoslavija (SFR\" or \"SR Jugoslavija)\" / \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 (\u0421\u0420\u0408 or \u0421\u0420 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430)). \n\nThe FRY aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by other former republics. The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state. Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession. It re-applied for UN membership on 27 October and was admitted on 1 November 2000. \n\nThe FRY was initially dominated by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as President of Serbia (1989\u20131997) and then President of Yugoslavia (1997\u20132000). Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents (such as Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107) and prime ministers (such as Milan Pani\u0107). However, the Montenegrin government, initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, started gradually distancing themselves from his policies. That culminated in regime change in 1996, when his former ally Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 reversed his policies, became leader of Montenegro's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader Momir Bulatovi\u0107, who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government. As Bulatovi\u0107 was given central positions in Belgrade from that time (as federal Prime Minister), \u0110ukanovi\u0107 continued to govern Montenegro and further isolated it from Serbia, so that from 1996 to 2006, Montenegro and Serbia were only nominally one country\u2014governance at every feasible level was conducted locally (Belgrade for Serbia and Podgorica for Montenegro).", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did Yugoslavia disband?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did Serbia and Montenegro become?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Are they sometimes called FRY?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was the first to dominate the FRY?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What country did he serve in 1989?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "As what?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Until when?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where did he start serving then?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "As what?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "For how many years?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was his last year?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did the Montenegrin government remain supportive of him?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did the FRY was to be to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugslavia?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did the whole world agree?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who didn't?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did they ask the UN to continue the membership?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What did the UN do?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How did Milosevic leave his presidency in 2000?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "When were they put back into the UN?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When did they put in their application?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 319, "span_end": 323, "span_text": "1992", "input_text": "1992", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 413, "span_end": 443, "span_text": "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia", "input_text": "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 445, "span_end": 497, "span_text": "FRY or FR Yugoslavia; \"Savezna Republika Jugoslavija", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1194, "span_end": 1212, "span_text": "Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107", "input_text": "Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1229, "span_end": 1235, "span_text": "Serbia", "input_text": "Serbia", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1215, "span_end": 1226, "span_text": " President ", "input_text": "President", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1242, "span_end": 1247, "span_text": "1997)", "input_text": "1997", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1270, "span_end": 1280, "span_text": "Yugoslavia", "input_text": "Yugoslavia", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1257, "span_end": 1266, "span_text": "President", "input_text": "President", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1280, "span_end": 1293, "span_text": " (1997\u20132000).", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1287, "span_end": 1295, "span_text": "2000).

It was Christmas and his only friend Jacob Marley, had been dead for seven years. What was there for him to celebrate? He listened with growing anger to the people calling out greetings in the street and _ his nephew Bob Cratchit, who was just ready to go home. \"Merry Christmas, uncle,\" called Bob as he hurried out of the door. \n\nScrooge sighed. He might just as well go to bed. Aware that he should not waste his candle, he quickly undressed and climbed into bed. But no sooner had he done so than the ghost of Marley, covered in chains, appeared. \"What's the matter, Jacob?\" he asked. \"There are the chains I made in my life,\" answered the ghost. \"I'm forced to wander around with no rest and no peace. I have come here to warn you that if you do not change, this too will be your fate. You will be visited by three spirits. Expect the first one tomorrow when the clock strikes one. Expect the second and the third on the following nights at the same hour.\" With that Marley vanished. \"Nonsense!\" he said and going back to bed, fell fast asleep. \n\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was dark. The clock struck one. At the sound, light flashed into the room and there stood a young boy. \"Who are you?\" asked Scrooge in an unsteady voice. \"I'm the spirit of Christmas past,\" replied the spirit. \"Come with me.\" \"Do you remember this?\" he asked. Scrooge did. He heard the happy cries of people, and looking around he found himself, as he used to be, sitting on a chair and reading. It was a Christmas. Suddenly Scrooge watched his younger self joined in a band, dancing and laughing. \"Strange,\" said the spirit, \"that such little things should make people so happy.\" The ghost let him go and Scrooge sank down into a deep sleep. \n\nWhen he awoke again the second night, the clock sounded one again. Before he doubted the second spirit already turned up. The fat and jolly spirit was smiling,\"I'm the spirit of Christmas present.\"Again Scrooge grasped the spirit's hand and was transported to a small house filled with a number of children and their mother. \"Why, it's my nephew Bob's house,\" cried Scrooge in astonishment. His surprise increased when the door opened and in came Bob carrying a small, sick boy, Tiny Tim. \"Sit down,\" cried Bob to his family. \"Let's have the best Christmas dinner!\" They all began to eat eagerly. Scrooge watched at the happiness and contentment of his poor nephew's family. \"A Merry Christmas to us all!\" cried Bob. \"God bless us everyone!\" added Tiny Tim, who sat very close to his father and Bob held his thin hand tightly. \"No, not for the uncle, but for you and the children. Nobody knows better than you how mean that man is.\" exclaimed Bob's wife. \"Spirit,\" cried Scrooge. \"Will Tiny Tim live?\" \"If the future remains the same,\" said the spirit, \"there will be an empty chair next year.\" Again the spirit moved Scrooge away, and he fell asleep as he fell back into his bed. \n\nThe third night he woke and waited for the hour and the third spirit. This time the spirit didn't come in a flash of light but arrived quietly wearing a black cloth that covered its face and form. \"I'm the spirit of Christmas that is to come.\" The spirit pointed and led him to a large stone. It was at the foot of a grave that was clearly neglected. Scrooge looked closer with trembling fingers and with horror read his own name on the stone. \"Oh, spirit, no, no!\" The spirit's finger remained steady pointing at the grave. \"I will honour Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year,\" cried Scrooge in terror. He reached out to hold the spirit's hand, but it slipped away. Scrooge looked around him. he saw he was in his own bed with his own thing around him. \n\n\"I have learned from the past, present and the future,\" he rushed to the window and shouted to the boys below: \"What day is it today?\" \"Why, it's Christmas Day,\" they replied in amazement. \"Wonderful,\" cried Scrooge. He rushed to his office to wait for Bob. When he entered, Scrooge pretended to look angry. \"Do you know what day it is, my boy?\" he asked Bob. \"I'm not going to stand for this any longer,\" he continued, \"and so I'm going to raise your salary.\" Bob looked amazed. \"A Merry Christmas, Bob,\" cried Scrooge slapping him on the back. \"I want to help you and your family.

No charges have been filed. \n\nEarlier Friday, a Canadian government source close to the investigation said the three men arrested previously \"are not card-carrying members of al Qaeda but they follow in the movement and show common trends.\" \n\nRCMP Chief Superintendent Serge Therriault said Thursday the three suspects are Canadian citizens living in Ontario -- Hiva Mohammad Alizadeh, 30, of Ottawa; Misbahuddin Ahmed, 26, of Ottawa; and Khurram Syed Sher, 28, of London. \n\nThe name of the suspect arrested Friday has not been released. \n\nAlizadeh faces three charges: conspiracy, committing an act for a terrorist group and providing or making available property for terrorist purposes. Canadian federal prosecutor David McKercher told CNN the three charges carry maximum sentences ranging from ten years to life in prison. \n\nAhmed has been charged with conspiracy, but he could face more charges, according to his defense attorney. Ian Carter told CNN he met with Ahmed for half an hour.

She had lain awake for the most part of the night, thinking about him and the strayed Herdwicks while she listened to the gale. Now and then Lucy went to the door and looked up the dale to the glimmering line of foam that marked the spot where Bleatarn beck came down. A path followed the water-side, but she could not see men or sheep in the gloom, and if Kit did not come soon he would be too late. \n\nRailton sat gloomily by the fire.

Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship. \n\nRead more: Concordia righted \n\nDefense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship now that it is upright. Such an examination could include divers going deep into the belly of the vessel to examine whether watertight doors sealed properly, and whether automatic generators functioned. He also wants to walk the judges through the command bridge in a re-creation of the night of the crash. Half of the command bridge was submerged for 20 months. \n\nThe trial began with preliminary hearings last March, but Monday was the first time the court heard any substantial evidence in the case.

Expo gives you a unique opportunity to meet leading industrialists and educators. \n\nI spoke to several young people at Expo, and they all agreed how useful it was to have so much information under one roof. \n\nDuncan Kelly intends to take a university course in design after he leaves school. He was collecting some of the free literature when I spoke to him. \"I'm not in a hurry to make a choice at the moment. I want to get all the information before I make up my mind.\" \n\nOne feature of Expo is the careers seminars , at which expert speakers outline their respective fields. Barbara Watts is already at university, in the second year of a law degree. She's decided to keep on studying after she graduates. She attended a seminar on international law. \"The speaker was really good at getting across his message,\" said Barbara. \"It was very helpful.\" \n\nBut Expo isn't just for people who are still in education. It also offers help to those in employment, and to people who are considering retraining or a change of career. \n\nOne advantage of Expo in that you can meet many prospective employers face to face, and talk to them frankly about your plans. As Charles Li told me, \"Normally I wouldn't dare to go and talk to the manager of a company. But today I have talked to several managers. It's easy to meet them here, in a relaxed environment.\" He left school after Junior High and went to work in a factory to earn a living. He's looking at changing his career and perhaps tidying to be an accountant. \n\nThe organizers expect over 200,000 young people to visit Expo, and there's no doubt that it's a bit of a squash . But the opportunities available here certainly make up for any discomfort. So, if you need any help with your future, come along to Expo. You don't need a ticket. It's open today, Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 7 pm, and entry is free to all.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many people are expected to attend this event?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Are they old?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How much does it cost?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "With whom did Charles meet?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is that something he generally does?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why was he able to today?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is the atmosphere tense?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did he go to university?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How much education does he have?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did he do after that?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did he do immediately after school?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What are Duncan's plans?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "In what field?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does he have all the details worked out already?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is he acquiring to aid in his decision?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many were interviewed/quoted?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who's the third?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Was there a woman quoted?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What's her name?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Is she in school?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "What course is she pursuing?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "How long has she been doing that?", "turn_id": 22}, {"input_text": "Did she go to a program at this event?", "turn_id": 23}, {"input_text": "What did she attend?", "turn_id": 24}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1694, "span_end": 1701, "span_text": "200,000", "input_text": "200,000", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1702, "span_end": 1707, "span_text": "young", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1923, "span_end": 1942, "span_text": "don't need a ticket", "input_text": "free", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1433, "span_end": 1449, "span_text": "several managers", "input_text": "several managers", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1356, "span_end": 1367, "span_text": " dare to go", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1456, "span_end": 1478, "span_text": "easy to meet them here", "input_text": "easy to meet them here", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1485, "span_end": 1492, "span_text": "relaxed", "input_text": "no, not at all", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1528, "span_end": 1539, "span_text": "Junior High", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1528, "span_end": 1539, "span_text": "Junior High", "input_text": "Junior High", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1604, "span_end": 1623, "span_text": "changing his career", "input_text": "changing his career", "turn_id": 10, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1552, "span_end": 1569, "span_text": "work in a factory", "input_text": "work in a factory", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 392, "span_end": 416, "span_text": "take a university course", "input_text": "take a university course", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 420, "span_end": 426, "span_text": "design", "input_text": "design", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 592, "span_end": 603, "span_text": "information", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 480, "span_end": 496, "span_text": " free literature", "input_text": "free literature", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1316, "span_end": 1323, "span_text": "Charles", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1316, "span_end": 1326, "span_text": "Charles Li", "input_text": "Charles Li", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 737, "span_end": 744, "span_text": "Barbara", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 737, "span_end": 750, "span_text": "Barbara Watts", "input_text": "Barbara Watts", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 765, "span_end": 775, "span_text": "university", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 20}, {"span_start": 800, "span_end": 804, "span_text": " law", "input_text": "law", "turn_id": 21}, {"span_start": 784, "span_end": 794, "span_text": "second yea", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 22}, {"span_start": 872, "span_end": 911, "span_text": "attended a seminar on international law", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 23}, {"span_start": 883, "span_end": 911, "span_text": "seminar on international law", "input_text": "seminar on international law", "turn_id": 24}], "name": "high24106.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3x4mxao0bgoed6nml46jghf9vk1rw8", "filename": "high7991.txt", "story": "With the passing of Steve Jobs, the tech industry has lost one of its most respected heroes.

Facebook owner, Mark Zuckerberg, has star power, but he and his company are still too young and untested.

It worked, and made Apple into the biggest and richest tech company in the world. Jeff Bezos is doing the same thing at Amazon. \n\nIn 2006, Amazon noticed it had a lot of spare capacity in its data centers. So it started renting out some of that capacity to some companies. Now, hundreds of newly-established Internet companies, including big names like Foursquare and Yelp, run their businesses on Amazon Web Services. Somehow, an outline bookseller became the most important provider of \"cloud computing\". \n\nIn 2007, Amazon introduced its e-reader, the Kindle. The product developed slowly for a couple of years, and then started to take off in 2010 with the third generation.

He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them.

One afternoon, my eight-year-old sister Brittany and I were with the drama group rehearsing A Little Princess, a children's play. \"Good luck!\" I whispered as Brittany adjusted her boarding school costume. \n\n\"Take your places for act one, please. Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay. \n\nTen minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \"All the other girls laughed, too.\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister ! \n\nWhen we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her. \n\nBefore the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\" she said. \n\nBut Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way. \n\nIt was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform. There would be three performances over the course of the next weekend. Brittany and I were glad that the ordeal was almost over. \n\nAfter the first show, Brittany and I each got a beautiful bouquet from our church's pastor and his wife. Jessica didn't get a single flower. The second night, we received flowers from our grandparents. Again, Jessica received nothing. \n\nOn the way home, Brittany spoke up. \"Mommy\", she said quietly from the back seat of the car, \"I've been thinking, and I decided to buy some flowers for Jessica,\" Mom smiled in surprise and replied, \"That would be very nice.\" \n\nBefore the last performance, Brittany met Jessica on the way to the theater. She handed the older girl a big bunch of yellow roses, bought with her own savings. \"Great job with the show last night, Jessica. These are for you.\" Jessica was astonished. \"For me?\" she said. \"These flowers are for me? Are you sure?\" \"Yes I want you to have them!\" Brittany skipped towards the dressing room, leaving Jessica staring at her with a confused look on her face and a bouquet of beautiful flowers in her arms. \n\nThat night, Jessica finally received some flowers from her dad. She pulled out a spring of carnations and smiled shyly as she gave them to Brittany. \n\nMaybe Jessica will never apologize to Brittany. Maybe she won't ever even admit her mistake. But she is just beginning to realize what wonderful things a person's love does in people like Brittany.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who met them backstage?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What were they rehearsing?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was telling them what to do?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is Brittany?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many performances would there be next weekend?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did the Children\u2019s theater have staircases?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who bought Jessica flowers?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what was Jessica sitting in?", "turn_id": 8, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Did anyone buy Jessica flowers the first 2 shows?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did Jessica apologize to Brittany?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did Brittany grab from the table during rehearsal?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "was it easy for Brittany to work with Jessica?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who sprayed Brittany with liquid?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What color flowers did Brittany give to Jessica?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who gave them a bouquet after the first show?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did Jessica give Brittany flowers?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What color liquid was Brittany sprayed with?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who gave them flowers the second night?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1159, "span_end": 1184, "span_text": "Brittany met me backstage", "input_text": "Brittany", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 195, "span_end": 243, "span_text": "rehearsing A Little Princess, a children's play.", "input_text": "A Little Princess, a children's play.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 360, "span_end": 410, "span_text": "Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director", "input_text": "the director", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 113, "span_end": 162, "span_text": " One afternoon, my eight-year-old sister Brittany", "input_text": "The authors little sister", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 2415, "span_end": 2449, "span_text": "There would be three performances ", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 114, "span_text": "The children's Theater was actually an old mill building with cement walls, twisting passages and big staircases.

The company is celebrating 60 years since its first theme park, Disneyland, opened in California, US in 1955. Disney has opened many more parks all over the world since it made history in California. Shanghai Disneyland is expected to open in 2016, bringing Disney's popular parks here to the Chinese mainland for the first time. So why has Disneyland been so popular for 60 years? Well, it's described as \"the Happiest Place on Earth\" and \"a place for the young and _ \". Many Americans have grown up with the parks, as ex--Disneyland president Paul Pressler said in 1995: \"There is an emotional relationship that people have with this park.\" Disneyland was one of the first theme parks anywhere in the world that had \"lands\" and rides with themes. Disney's storytelling in rides like roller coasters is a big reason for their parks' success. \"We tell a story in everything we do,\" Pressler said. Disney rides such as The seven Dwarves Mine Train and Peter Pan's Flight come from its movies. One ride from its 2013 hit movie Frozen will surely be coming soon, perhaps at the new Shanghai Disneyland. Disney's parks haven't always been popular everywhere, however.

Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship.

Tom Sawyer said, \"One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'\" \n\nBesides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him. \n\nFinally Mark Twain said that the character of Tom sawyer was based on a mix of three real people---John B.

But Jarrett Barrios, president of GLAAD said, \"We still have a long way to go before we're fully represented [on] TV.\" \n\nIn addition to the increasing number LGBT characters on scripted shows, which currently represents a little more than 3 percent of all leading and supporting characters on broadcast networks, there are also more openly gay actors and producers working in Hollywood, says Barrios. \n\nActor Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays the character Mitchell on the ABC prime time show \"Modern Family.\" Like his on-screen role, Ferguson himself is openly gay. \n\n\"The opportunity to play not only a well developed gay character, but a dad, a son and brother was really appealing to me. ... I chose to play him very close to myself and I think that truthfulness was appealing to the creators,\" Ferguson told CNN. \n\nHowever, Ferguson says his sexual orientation does not make him any more qualified to tackle a gay role than Eric Stonestreet, his straight co-star who plays Mitchell's partner Cameron.

She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death. \n\nStephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay. \n\nShelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. \"I thought every heartbeat would be her last,\" Stephen says. \n\nAs days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance. \n\nAnd he decided there still was a chance. \n\nThe family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. \"Did you understand that?\" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks. \n\nShelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. \"She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was.\" Elovie says. \n\nWhen Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it \"miracle after miracle\". As for his experience, Stephen says, \"This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was in a accident?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was she doing?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where was she from?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did the accident occur there?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did it happen?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was she doing there?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What happened to her?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did she break any bones?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who found her?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was she taken to the hospital?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was her condition?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did they operate on her?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many times?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was she in a coma?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did she ever recover?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many surgeries did she undergo in total?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Will she need more?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Did she awake from the coma?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who did her husband thank for this?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 74, "span_end": 80, "span_text": "Shelli", "input_text": "Shelli", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 449, "span_end": 464, "span_text": "electric motors", "input_text": "riding, electric motors", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 342, "span_end": 361, "span_text": "South Jordan, Utah.", "input_text": "South Jordan, Utah.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 372, "span_end": 381, "span_text": "in Hawaii", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 371, "span_end": 381, "span_text": " in Hawaii", "input_text": "in Hawaii", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 382, "span_end": 402, "span_text": "on a family vacation", "input_text": "She was on a family vacation", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 82, "span_end": 119, "span_text": "badly wounded on the side of the road", "input_text": "She wrecked.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 121, "span_end": 216, "span_text": "She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones", "input_text": "She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 269, "span_end": 276, "span_text": "Stephen", "input_text": "Stephen", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 682, "span_end": 707, "span_text": "into shock at the hospita", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 601, "span_end": 708, "span_text": "Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital", "input_text": "Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 796, "span_end": 837, "span_text": "she lived through half a dozen operations", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 813, "span_end": 826, "span_text": " half a dozen", "input_text": "half a dozen", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 710, "span_end": 758, "span_text": "Physicians were able to make her come to herself", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1866, "span_end": 1906, "span_text": "helli's recovery has been slow but stead", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 2017, "span_end": 2019, "span_text": "17", "input_text": "17", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2042, "span_end": 2067, "span_text": "may require more surgery.", "input_text": "Maybe", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1865, "span_end": 1907, "span_text": "Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 2372, "span_end": 2431, "span_text": "This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith.\"", "input_text": "God", "turn_id": 19}], "name": "high1791.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3ph3vy7djlxnfx9dvl0w2kh83ucwzj", "filename": "middle3961.txt", "story": "It is not easy to be a vet .You never know when you will be called upon to take care of a sick animal.

I was thinking how beautiful she looked, and how much I loved her; also of other things that were not so pleasant. For instance, why did not everybody see her with my eyes? I could not hide from myself that Ragnar went near to hating her; more than once she had almost been the cause of a quarrel between us.

Of those who were dearest to me, indeed, only Steinar seemed to think Iduna as perfect as I did myself. This, so far as it went, was well; but, then, Steinar and I had always thought alike, which robbed his judgment of something of its worth. \n\nWhilst I was pondering over these things, although it was still so early that my father and Athalbrand were yet in bed sleeping off the fumes of the liquor they had drunk, I heard Steinar himself talking to the messengers from Agger in the hall. They asked him humbly whether he would be pleased to return with them that day and take possession of his inheritance, since they must get back forthwith to Agger with their tidings. He replied that if they would send some or come themselves to escort him on the tenth day from that on which they spoke, he would go to Agger with them, but that until then he could not do so.

Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . In his book, A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, what the mother has done is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again. Why? She wants it to remember how it can get up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying great people, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something unusual about these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What position is giraffe in after being born?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is its first lesson?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does it have to do after being kicked?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does the mother do after the baby stands up for the first time?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's the purpose of that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why is this so important?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who used this survival technique in his works?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which famous people did he write about?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he have to say about them?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did having this happen to them make them want to give up on life?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 53, "span_end": 65, "span_text": " on its back", "input_text": "on its back", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 435, "span_end": 450, "span_text": "kicks her baby,", "input_text": "Being kicked by it's mother.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 496, "span_end": 503, "span_text": " get up", "input_text": "get up", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 735, "span_text": "Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again", "input_text": "Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 742, "span_end": 785, "span_text": "She wants it to remember how it can get up.", "input_text": "She wants it to remember how it can get up.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 882, "span_text": "In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group", "input_text": "In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 927, "span_end": 940, "span_text": "Irving Stone ", "input_text": "Irving Stone", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1034, "span_end": 1099, "span_text": "Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin", "input_text": "Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1267, "span_end": 1341, "span_text": "They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere.", "input_text": "They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1343, "span_end": 1376, "span_text": "ut every time they stand up again", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "middle3974.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3nvc2eb65qzqj9xkpfnbjgx90hn3yn", "filename": "cnn_ae82c64f879b0738ce3b485958355ea91dc8795d.story", "story": "(CNN) -- Those who knew Maya Angelou and others inspired by her life, wisdom and words were remembering her Wednesday. \n\n\"Phenomenal Woman\" -- the title of Angelou's poem celebrating the strength of women -- quickly trended worldwide on Twitter.

When Harry Warrington was taken by those bailiffs, I had intended to tell you how the good Mrs. Lambert, hearing of the boy's mishap, had flown to her husband, and had begged, implored, insisted, that her Martin should help him. \"Never mind his rebeldom of the other day; never mind about his being angry that his presents were returned--of course anybody would be angry, much more such a high-spirited lad as Harry! Never mind about our being so poor, and wanting all our spare money for the boys at college; there must be some way of getting him out of the scrape. Did you not get Charles Watkins out of the scrape two years ago; and did he not pay you back every halfpenny? Yes; and you made a whole family happy, blessed be God! and Mrs. Watkins prays for you and blesses you to this very day, and I think everything has prospered with us since. And I have no doubt it has made you a major-general--no earthly doubt,\" says the fond wife.

It was characterized by considerable instability, leaving it ill-prepared for international conflict only two decades later when war broke out in 1846. Native American raids in Mexico's sparsely settled north in the decades preceding the war prompted the Mexican government to sponsor migration from the U.S.A. on its northeast border (since 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase from the French Empire (France) of Emperor Napoleon I) to the Mexican province of Texas to create a buffer. However, the newly-named \"Texians\" revolted against the Mexican government of President / dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who had usurped the Mexican constitution of 1824, in the subsequent 1836 Texas Revolution, creating a republic not recognized by Mexico, which still claimed it as part of its national territory.

values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What's the smallest division of a dollar?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's this called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is this measurement used for?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Were gold coins used?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Up to what value?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was measurement called?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did they fall out of use?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are coins worth more than a dollar produced today?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many $100 coins were produced?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How about $50 coins?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What would they have been called?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was paper money less than a dollar ever used?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What negative term was used to describe them?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 400, "span_text": "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values.

Around him was a mass of tangled foliage, and close beside him lay Arthur Hill, the blood slowly oozing from a terrible gash in his forehead.

Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \n\nThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. \n\nThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side.

The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \"Pinax theatri botanici\" (English, \"Illustrated exposition of plants\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. \n\nThe application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the \"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\" (\"ICZN\") for animals and the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\" (\"ICN\").

The inconstant populace began to shout forth his name in the streets, and to sneer at the inactivity of his son Boabdil el Chico. The latter, though in the flower of his age and distinguished for vigor and dexterity in jousts and tournaments, had never yet fleshed his weapon in the field of battle; and it was murmured that he preferred the silken repose of the cool halls of the Alhambra to the fatigue and danger of the foray and the hard encampments of the mountains. \n\nThe popularity of these rival kings depended upon their success against the Christians, and Boabdil el Chico found it necessary to strike some signal blow to counterbalance the late triumph of his father. He was further incited by his father-in-law, Ali Atar, alcayde of Loxa, with whom the coals of wrath against the Christians still burned among the ashes of age, and had lately been blown into a flame by the attack made by Ferdinand on the city under his command. \n\nAli Atar informed Boabdil that the late discomfiture of the Christian knights had stripped Andalusia of the prime of her chivalry and broken the spirit of the country. All the frontier of Cordova and Ecija now lay open to inroad; but he especially pointed out the city of Lucena as an object of attack, being feebly garrisoned and lying in a country rich in pasturage, abounding in cattle and grain, in oil and wine. The fiery old Moor spoke from thorough information, for he had made many an incursion into these parts, and his very name was a terror throughout the country.

It's the spot that was visited on April 8, 1974, by a baseball representing the 715th home run of his career. \n\nJust like that, Babe Ruth's record was history. \n\nSo is the spot -- almost. \n\nFor now, the spot is preserved in a parking lot that once was Atlanta Fulton-County Stadium, where Aaron sealed his immortality with his high-arching blast over the fence in left-center field. The spot is surrounded by part of the old ballpark's outfield wall, and high above the spot is a large baseball-shaped placard with the inscription: Hank Aaron, home run, 715, April 8, 1974. \n\nThe whole scene is illuminated by lights. As a result, those traveling across the street to the Braves' current place of Turner Field can see the spot as they either walk through or drive by the parking lot at night. \n\n\"I'd hate for that mark to be destroyed,\" said Aaron, shaking his head while looking visibly distraught. \"In fact, I've gone out there with several people and taken pictures at that spot.\" \n\nThat spot is among the places in the universe that should remain as unmolested as possible for eternity. Think Gettysburg. The Mount of Olives. Dealey Plaza. Tranquility Base. \n\nWhat Aaron did 40 years ago Tuesday with a flick of his quick wrists was as much for society as it was for baseball.

Moving from Miami to Houston to Atlanta, she started rapping in the Southern-style accent of her surroundings and her single \"Ignorant Art\" came out in 2011. From then on, she has never looked back. \n\nHowever, her style has caused lots of discussions. She might be one of the most polarizing artists. She raps with a southern American accent, even though she speaks with an Australian one. Many people comment that she overuses black culture in her music. \n\nHer supporters are against it.

However, public speaking fills most people with dread. Humiliation is the greatest fear; self-exposure and failing to appeal to the audience come a close second. Women hate it most, since girls are pressurized from an early age to be concerned with appearance of all kinds. \n\nMost people have plenty of insecurities, and this seems like a situation that will bring them out. If you were under pressure to be perfect, you are terrified of failing in the most public of ways. \n\nWhile extroverts will feel less fear before the ordeal , it does not mean they will necessarily do it better. Some very shy people manage to shine. When I met the British Comedian Julian, he was shy and cautious, yet his TV performances are perfect. \n\nIn fact, personality is not the best predictor of who does it well. Regardless of what you are like in real life, the key seems to be to act yourself. \n\nActual acting, as in performing the scripted lines of a character other than yourself, does not do the job. While politicians may limit damage by having carefully rehearsed, written scripts to speak from, there is always a hidden awareness among the audience that the words might not be true. \n\nLikewise, the incredibly perfect speeches of many American academics are far from natural. You may end up buying their book on the way out, but soon afterwards, it is much like fast food, and you get a nameless sense that you've been cheated. \n\nAlthough, as Earl Spencer proved at his sister Princess Diana's funeral, it is possible both to prepare every word and to act naturally. A script rarely works and it is used to help most speakers. \n\nBut, being yourself doesn't work either. If you spoke as if you were in your own kitchen, it would be too authentic, too unaware of the need to communicate with an audience. \n\nI remember going to see British psychiatrist R.D. Laing speak in public. He behaved like a seriously odd person, talking off the top of his head.

The single \"Anything Could Happen\" has the London Community Gospel Choir swooping around staccato piano and club beats; elsewhere she's multitracked into a one-woman choir. If the songwriting doesn't quite measure up to U.K. art-pop divas like Kate Bush, the hooks always go to town, and her voice -- Dolly Parton-dazzling in the upper register -- mates gorgeously with electronics, swirling around itself on the title track, morphing through synthscapes on \"Don't Say a Word.\" \"I Need Your Love,\" a bangin' collab with Scottish rave-op master Calvin Harris (Rihanna's \"We Found Love\"), gets slotted as a \"bonus cut,\" maybe to avoid confusing the more genteel fans.

remained behind bars Thursday, facing felony charges. \n\nLee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead, appeared in court Wednesday night wearing a green protective vest reserved for those on suicide watch, reported CNN affiliate WFOR.

Griffith said it was his understanding that the child was being kept on life support so his organs could be donated. \n\nDejesus is charged with aggravated child abuse with great harm, a first-degree felony, and aggravated child neglect with great harm, a second-degree felony. Griffith said once prosecutors are notified the child has been taken off life support and pronounced dead, they are poised to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus. \n\nMiami-Dade police said Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work Monday night. \n\nHe told police that he put on boxing gloves and struck the child about 15 times on his face, head, torso and shoulders over a period of 15 minutes, punching him so hard at one point that the boy fell off the bed and struck his head on the tile floor. \n\nThe child was rushed to Children's Hospital where he underwent surgery for bleeding on the brain. \n\nA criminal complaint alleges that Dejesus waited to call for medical help for as long as an hour after the boy became unresponsive. He eventually called 911 after the boy's lips became blue, according to the complaint.

For the Tringle carriage could be spared for a visit in Brook Street, even though there was still a remembrance in the bosom of Aunt Emmeline of the evil things which had been done by the Marchesa in Rome. Then there came a dance,--which was not so easy. The Marchesa and Nina were going to a dance at Lady Putney's, and arrangements were made that Ayala should be taken. Ayala begged that there might be no arrangements, declared that she would be quite happy to see Nina go forth in her finery.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court says it is investigating an alleged \"crime against humanity\" involving Israel for its 2002 bombing in Gaza that killed 15 people and wounded 150 others. \n\nThe case names former Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six other Israelis. \n\nThe case, brought by Palestinian relatives of some of the deceased, names former Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six other Israeli top military commanders and security officials at the time. \n\nThe National Court said it has jurisdiction to investigate the case, and that initial evidence suggests the bombing \"should be considered a crime against humanity,\" according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN on Thursday. \n\nEdwin Yabo, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Madrid, said Israel would not comment until it receives formal notification of the case.

This is what makes it unusual, says Stephen Braun, author of Buzz: The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine. \"Its appeal is that it helps us earn more money,\" he adds. \"What makes it different from other drugs is that it's used as a productivity tool -- not for pleasure.\" Many of history's creative minds have also been associated with a large amount of caffeine consumption. According to one biographer, the French novelist and playwright Balzac drank as many as 50 cups of coffee a day. \"Were it not for coffee one could not write, which is to say one could not live,\" he once insisted. For seven years, the film-maker David Lynch ate at the same Los Angeles diner every day, drinking up to seven sweetened cups of coffee \"with lots of sugar\" in one sitting, which he said would guarantee that \"lots of ideas\" arrived. Ludwig van Beethoven was said to have painstakingly counted out exactly 60 coffee beans per cup when he brewed coffee. Perhaps recent tales of caffeine excess featured the singer Robbie Williams, who reportedly consumed 36 cups of black coffee and 20 cans of Red Bull a day. It is the routine task itself, as much as the stimulating effects of caffeine, that makes the process so important, says Mason Currey, author of Daily Rituals: How Artists Work. \"A lot of artists use the process of making coffee as a gateway to the creative process,\" he adds. \"You need to get into the right mindset to do that sort of work, and the preparation process provides a focus.\" One problem with attempting to control caffeine, says Braun, is that it affects everyone differently -- it is impossible to work out a \"safe\" limit that works for everyone. \"Eventually, you have to become your own scientist -- there isn't an alternative to careful self-experimentation,\" he says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the main side effect of caffeine?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What makes this more unique than other drugs?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What do many of the famous creative people have in common?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What famous play writed would drink a ton of it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How much did he drink?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What would happen if he didn't?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What film maker was famous of eating at the same place?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How much would he drink?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What famous composer was specific about his coffee?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did a famous sing consume along side his coffee?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How much?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 54, "span_end": 81, "span_text": " it helps you get more done", "input_text": "it helps you get more done", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 305, "span_end": 338, "span_text": "it's used as a productivity tool ", "input_text": "it's used as a productivity tool", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 391, "span_end": 463, "span_text": "s have also been associated with a large amount of caffeine consumption.", "input_text": "They have been associated with a large amount of caffeine consumption.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 528, "span_end": 534, "span_text": "Balzac", "input_text": "Balzac", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 552, "span_end": 575, "span_text": "50 cups of coffee a day", "input_text": "50 cups of coffee a day", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 604, "span_end": 620, "span_text": " could not write", "input_text": "he could not write", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 708, "span_end": 720, "span_text": " David Lynch", "input_text": "David Lynch", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 780, "span_end": 802, "span_text": " seven sweetened cups ", "input_text": "seven sweetened cups", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 929, "span_text": "Ludwig van Beethoven", "input_text": "Ludwig van Beethoven", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 960, "span_end": 1004, "span_text": " counted out exactly 60 coffee beans per cup", "input_text": "he counted out exactly 60 coffee beans per cup", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1167, "span_end": 1176, "span_text": " Red Bull", "input_text": "Red Bull", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1156, "span_end": 1164, "span_text": " 20 cans", "input_text": "20 cans", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "high11983.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "31lm9edvols7sovvly6ni7grrndjni", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Phillips Oppenheim___The Great Prince Shan.txt/CHAPTER V_a62c3106e04ed06d22a0f6a39c4849d22b323f78b26cb3eb2856754", "story": "CHAPTER V \n\nNigel and Maggie had tea together in the little room which the latter had used as a boudoir.

Every spring the fighting men went out, attacked their neighbors, drove off their cattle, and tried to take some town; then fought a battle, and went home to reap the harvest, gather the grapes and olives in the autumn, and attend to public business and vote for the magistrates in the winter. They were small wars, but famous men fought in them. In a war against the Volscians, when Cominius was consul, he was besieging a city called Corioli, when news came that the men of Antium were marching against him, and in their first attack on the walls the Romans were beaten off, but a gallant young patrician, descended from the king Ancus Marcius, Caius Marcius by name, rallied them and led them back with such spirit that the place was taken before the hostile army came up; then he fought among the foremost and gained the victory. When he was brought to the consul's tent covered with wounds, Cominius did all he could to show his gratitude--set on the young man's head the crown of victory, gave him the surname of Coriolanus in honor of his exploits, and granted him the tenth part of the spoil of ten prisoners. Of them, however, Coriolanus only accepted one, an old friend of the family, whom he set at liberty at once. Afterwards, when there was a great famine in Rome, Coriolanus led an expedition to Antium, and brought away quantities of corn and cattle, which he distributed freely, keeping none for himself.

Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. \n\nThe genre of horror has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These were manifested in stories of beings such as witchcraft, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. European horror fiction became established through works by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who was the inspiration for the title of \"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus\". Prometheus' earliest known appearance is in Hesiod's \"Theogony\". However, the story of Frankenstein was influenced far greater on the story of Hippolytus. Asclepius revived Hippolytus from death. Euripides wrote plays based on the story, \"Hippolytos Kalyptomenos\" and \"Hippolytus (play).\" Plutarch's \"The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: Cimon\" describes the spirit of the murderer,Damon , who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea. Pliny the Younger describes Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was cautious since the house was inexpensive. As Athenodorus writes a book a philosophy, he is visited by an aberration bound in chains.

Indeed, the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the death of its mistress, and without any real head to direct them the servants were patiently awaiting the advent of a new master or mistress. It did not seem clear to them yet whether Miss Patricia or Lawyer Watson was to take charge of Elmhurst: but there were few tears shed for Jane Merrick, and the new regime could not fail to be an improvement over the last. \n\nAt dinner the young folks chatted together in a friendly and eager manner concerning the events of the day. They knew of old James' unfortunate end, but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention. The main subject of conversation was Aunt Jane's surprising act in annulling her last will and forcing Patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it. Kenneth, being at his ease when alone with the three cousins, protested that it would not be right for Patsy to give him all the estate. But, as she was so generous, he would accept enough of his Uncle Tom's money to educate him as an artist and provide for himself an humble home.

Where \"myr\" \"is\" seen in geology it is usually \"Myr\" (a unit of mega-years). In astronomy it is usually \"MYR\" (million years). \n\nIn geology the debate of the millennia concerns the use of \"myr\" remains open concerning \"the use of \"Myr\" plus \"Mya\"\" versus \"using \"Mya\" only\". In either case the term \"Ma\" is used in geology literature conforming to ISO 31-1 (now ISO 80000-3) and NIST 811 recommended practices. Traditional style geology literature is written The \"ago\" is implied, so that any such year number \"X Ma\" between 66 and 145 is \"Cretaceous\", for good reason. But the counter argument is that having \"myr\" for a duration and \"Mya\" for an age mixes unit systems, and tempts capitalization errors: \"million\" need not be capitalized, but \"mega\" must be; \"ma\" would technically imply a \"milliyear\" (a thousandth of a year, or 8 hours).

Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction \"and\" denoted as \u2227, the disjunction \"or\" denoted as \u2228, and the negation \"not\" denoted as \u00ac. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations. \n\nBoolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\" (1847), and set forth more fully in his \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought\" (1854). According to Huntington, the term \"Boolean algebra\" was first suggested by Sheffer in 1913. \n\nBoolean algebra has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics, and is provided for in all modern programming languages. It is also used in set theory and statistics. \n\nBoole's algebra predated the modern developments in abstract algebra and mathematical logic; it is however seen as connected to the origins of both fields. In an abstract setting, Boolean algebra was perfected in the late 19th century by Jevons, Schr\u00f6der, Huntington, and others until it reached the modern conception of an (abstract) mathematical structure. For example, the empirical observation that one can manipulate expressions in the algebra of sets by translating them into expressions in Boole's algebra is explained in modern terms by saying that the algebra of sets is \"a\" Boolean algebra (note the indefinite article). In fact, M. H. Stone proved in 1936 that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what did George Boole Introduce?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 607, "span_end": 653, "span_text": "Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole", "input_text": "George Boole", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "Boolean_algebra.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "37u1utwh9vm3n5r4n1qd21cndjsr8z", "filename": "cnn_e5852e0aef710c482bbbf45227b53e9e676b2761.story", "story": "New York (CNN) -- Two New York men accused of brutally beating an openly gay man have been indicted on hate crime charges, authorities said. \n\nThe indictment filed Thursday morning charges defendants Daniel Aleman, 26, and Daniel Rodriguez, 21, both of College Point in Queens, New York, of 14-counts of assault and robbery as a hate crime, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A.

Comedy from these people comes from a deep pain and sadness in their lives, or out of a deep-seated anger they have at the world around them. \n\nLook at Richard Pryor, need I say more? Richard seemed to have everything. For Superman m , he ended up getting more money than Christopher Reeve did. Yet he said while he was in his forties that the last truly happy moment he remembered in his life was when he was jumping around in the dirt while pretending to be a cowboy at the age of 10. This guy set himself on fire, and he played that for laugh while performing live at the Sunset Strip ! Comedy was his constant weapon against pain, and he never held anything back. \n\nThe movie Funny People understand very well this gloomy field many comedians have to survive in. It stars Adam Sandler as George Simmons, a famous comedian in the movie. Simmons has it all: a beautiful mansion overlooking the sea, a swimming pool,great cars, and so on. But in his eyes, we see that he is a sad man who has come to truly look down upon himself for what he has become. All the wealth he has collected only serves to separate him from the rest of the world and it makes him defensive when around total strangers who cannot see him as a normal person. But now, he hears from his doctor that he has a terminal disease and has only months left to live. Simmons reacts to this news as if someone took away his blood in the heart, and it makes him clearly see just how much he hates his life. So now he has to make every minute count. \n\nThen come a series of funny stories. \n\nComedy is just life as it is, isn't it?", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the lead in Funny People?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did the author like about comedians as a child?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What truth did he come to find out about them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What outrageous thing did Richard Pryor do?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why did he do that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who played the original Superman?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was the last happy moment that Richard Pryor remembers?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How old was he at that time?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the author's conclusion about comedy?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What bad news did George Simmons get?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "And what was his reaction to this news?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And what does he come to realize?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1060, "span_end": 1101, "span_text": " It stars Adam Sandler as George Simmons,", "input_text": "Adam Sandler", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 90, "span_text": "1 always figured that comedians were the best kind of people to hang around with as a kid.", "input_text": "They were the best kind of people to hang around with", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 91, "span_end": 177, "span_text": "They tell funny stories, make joke after joke, and happiness seems never to leave them", "input_text": "They tell funny stories, make joke after joke, and happiness seems never to leave them", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 179, "span_end": 368, "span_text": "But time goes on, and we come to see these same people as clowns on the outside, but crying a river in the inside.

Gaius Plinius Secundus, AD 23 \u2013 79) was a Roman author, naturalist and natural philosopher, a naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire, and friend of the emperor Vespasian. \n\nSpending most of his spare time studying, writing, and investigating natural and geographic phenomena in the field, Pliny wrote the encyclopedic \"Naturalis Historia\" (\"Natural History\"), which became an editorial model for encyclopedias. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, wrote of him in a letter to the historian Tacitus: \n\nPliny the Younger refers to Tacitus\u2019s reliance upon his uncle's book, the \"History of the German Wars\". Pliny the Elder died in AD 79, while attempting the rescue, by ship, of a friend and his family, in Stabiae, from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which already had destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The wind caused by the sixth and largest pyroclastic surge of the volcano\u2019s eruption did not allow his ship to leave port, and Pliny probably died during that event. \n\nPliny's dates are pinned to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and a statement of his nephew that he died in his 56th year, which would put his birth \n\nPliny was the son of an equestrian, Gaius Plinius Celer, and his wife, Marcella. Neither the younger nor the elder Pliny mention the names.

The reading of the inscription depends on the reconstruction, but in all cases the names come through. Whether he was an augur and whether she was named Grania Marcella are less certain.

Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern look for British and American women, and Art Deco peaked. Not everything roared: in the wake of the hyper-emotional patriotism of World War I, Warren G. Harding brought back normalcy to the politics of the United States. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electric appliances. Aviation became a business. The economies saw rapid industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democratic states, women won the right to vote. \n\nThe social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers, then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford to pay World War I reparations to the United Kingdom, France and the other Allied Powers, the United States came up with the Dawes Plan; named after banker, and later 30th Vice President Charles G. Dawes, respectively. Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to countries that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington.

It is closely related to Cook Islands M\u0101ori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian. \n\nA national census undertaken in 2013 reported that about 148,000 people, or 3.7% of the New Zealand population, could hold a conversation in M\u0101ori about everyday things. , 55% of M\u0101ori adults reported some knowledge of the language; of these speakers, 64% use M\u0101ori at home and 50,000 can speak the language \"very well\" or \"well\". \n\nThere was originally no native writing system for M\u0101ori. Missionaries brought the Latin alphabet around 1814, and linguist Samuel Lee worked with chief Hongi Hika to systematize the written language in 1820. The resultant phonetic spellings were remarkably successful. Written M\u0101ori has changed little since then. \n\nThe English word comes from the M\u0101ori language, where it is spelled \"M\u0101ori\".

The M\u0101ori-language spelling \"M\u0101ori\" (with macron) has become common in New Zealand English in recent years, particularly in M\u0101ori-specific cultural contexts, although the traditional

He was the bishop of Hippo Regius in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Era. Among his most important works are \"The City of God\" and \"Confessions.\" \n\nAccording to his contemporary, Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith.\" In his early years, he was influenced by Manichaeism and afterward by the neo-Platonism of Plotinus. After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. Believing that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made seminal contributions to the development of just war theory.

My experts tell me he wouldn't have.\" \n\nBush said, \"We ended it the way we said we would\" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending \"would have been perfect.\" \n\nHe added, \"If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many presidents are working together?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where did they appear?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "For what organization?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When was the first Gulf War?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does Bush regret?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Has he thought about it much?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was the war's nickname?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who said Saddam would surrender?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 9, "span_end": 30, "span_text": "Two former presidents", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 202, "span_end": 235, "span_text": "Bill Clinton and George H.W.

She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party.

In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony.

(Time Warner is the parent company of both Warner Bros. and CNN). \n\n\"Veronica Mars\" the movie is now in production and will be released in theaters in 2014. Thomas, Bell and the rest of the cast came to Comic-Con to share never-before-seen footage from the film with fans and backers. \n\nIn the movie, Veronica returns to her hometown of Neptune, California, for a high school reunion, bringing all the old characters back together. The footage reveals that Veronica is now a lawyer in New York City, outlaw character Weevil (played by Francis Capra) is settled down and married, and Jamie Lee Curtis has a role in the movie. \n\nBell spoke with CNN at the Samsung Galaxy Experience at Comic-Con, where she admitted how much the role of Veronica Mars means to her personally, what to expect on \"House of Lies\" season two and that time she and fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Dax Shepard were too busy to get married.

After high school, Lin sent his resume and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. \n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year. \n\nHe has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list. Lin will likely get stronger the more minutes he plays, and even if Davis returns, spelling the older, recovering player could be productive for Lin: a proven good student who can learn a lot from practicing against a veteran. \n\nWithout the services of All-Stars Carmelo and Amare, Lin led New York to a 4-0 record last week. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 20 points and seven assists in each of his first four starts, which generated a global following known as Linsanity.

I've struggled for the past year-and-half with my back, and it showed in my results. \n\n\"Even though I won five times two years ago, it was hit or miss some weeks and got progressively worse.

A yellow glow lingered in the southwest beyond Criffell's sloping shoulder, which ran up against it, tinged a deep violet. Masses of soft, gray cloud floated above the mountain's summit; but the sky was clear overhead, and a thin new moon grew brighter in the east This was why the murmur of the sea came out of the distance in a muffled roar, for the tides run fast when the moon is young. \n\nElsie, walking homeward, vacantly noticed how bright the crescent gleamed above the dusky firs, as she entered the gloom of a straggling wood at the foot of the hill on which Appleyard was built. She had been out all the afternoon and now she shrank from going home, for she felt that a shadow rested upon the house. Dick had returned from a cruise with Andrew, looking dejected and unwell; and she was glad that Whitney had taken both away again, on his motorcycle, because Dick had lately had fits of moody restlessness when he was at home. Still, she missed them badly, for her mother was silent and preoccupied; and when Andrew was away, she found it hard to banish the troubles that seemed to be gathering round. They were worse for being very vaguely defined, but she felt convinced that something sinister was going on. \n\nAs she thought of Andrew, her face grew gentle and she smiled. She knew his worth and his limitations, and loved him for both. He had his suspicions, too, and would follow where they led.

FURNIVAL AGAIN AT HIS CHAMBERS. \n\nThe Christmas doings at The Cleeve were not very gay. There was no visitor there, except Lady Mason, and it was known that she was in trouble. It must not, however, be supposed that she constantly bewailed herself while there, or made her friends miserable by a succession of hysterical tears. By no means. She made an effort to be serene, and the effort was successful--as such efforts usually are. On the morning of Christmas-day they duly attended church, and Lady Mason was seen by all Hamworth sitting in The Cleeve pew. In no way could the baronet's friendship have been shown more plainly than in this, nor could a more significant mark of intimacy have been given;--all which Sir Peregrine well understood. The people of Hamworth had chosen to talk scandal about Lady Mason, but he at any rate would show how little attention he paid to the falsehoods that there were circulated. So he stood by her at the pew door as she entered, with as much deference as though she had been a duchess; and the people of Hamworth, looking on, wondered which would be right, Mr. Dockwrath or Sir Peregrine. \n\nAfter dinner Sir Peregrine gave a toast. \"Lady Mason, we will drink the health of the absent boys. God bless them! I hope they are enjoying themselves.\" \n\n\"God bless them!\" said Mrs. Orme, putting her handkerchief to her eyes. \n\n\"God bless them both!\" said Lady Mason, also putting her handkerchief to her eyes.

More generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as primary consumers. \"Herbivory\" usually refers to animals eating plants; fungi, bacteria and protists that feed on living plants are usually termed plant pathogens (plant diseases), and microbes that feed on dead plants are saprotrophs.

It is currently the largest opposition party in the country. \n\nThe predecessor of the KMT, the Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of a republic. The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911. Sun was the provisional president but he did not have military power and ceded the first presidency to the military leader Yuan Shikai. After Yuan's death, China was divided by warlords, while the KMT was able to control only part of the south. Later led by Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT formed the National Revolutionary Army and succeeded in its Northern Expedition to unify much of China in 1928. It was the ruling party in mainland China from 1928 until its retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after being defeated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) during the Chinese Civil War, and despite losing its territory, the KMT held onto China's UN seat (with considerable international support) until 1971.

CLIMENE \n\nDiligent search among the many scenarios of the improvisers which have survived their day, has failed to bring to light the scenario of \"Les Fourberies de Scaramouche,\" upon which we are told the fortunes of the Binet troupe came to be soundly established. They played it for the first time at Maure in the following week, with Andre-Louis--who was known by now as Scaramouche to all the company, and to the public alike--in the title-role. If he had acquitted himself well as Figaro-Scaramouche, he excelled himself in the new piece, the scenario of which would appear to be very much the better of the two. \n\nAfter Maure came Pipriac, where four performances were given, two of each of the scenarios that now formed the backbone of the Binet repertoire. In both Scaramouche, who was beginning to find himself, materially improved his performances. So smoothly now did the two pieces run that Scaramouche actually suggested to Binet that after Fougeray, which they were to visit in the following week, they should tempt fortune in a real theatre in the important town of Redon. The notion terrified Binet at first, but coming to think of it, and his ambition being fanned by Andre-Louis, he ended by allowing himself to succumb to the temptation. \n\nIt seemed to Andre-Louis in those days that he had found his real metier, and not only was he beginning to like it, but actually to look forward to a career as actor-author that might indeed lead him in the end to that Mecca of all comedians, the Comedie Francaise.

Mourners gathered outside his house in Palo Alto, California, and Apple stores around the world. \n\nSteve Jobs made technology fun. As tech leaders, they're really happy if they have one hit in their life. Steve Jobs has the Apple II, the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad and Pixar. \n\nSteve Jobs was a college dropout. He was adopted by a machinist and his wife, an accountant. They supported his early interest in electronics. He and his friend Steve Wozniak started Apple Computer--now just called Apple--in 1976. They stayed at the company until 1985. That year, Steve Wozniak returned to college and Steve Jobs left in a dispute with the chief executive. \n\nMr. Jobs then formed his own company, called NeXT Computer. He rejoined Apple in 1997 after it bought NeXT, He helped remake Apple from a business that was in bad shape then to one of the most valuable companies in the world today. However, Steve Jobs stepped down as Apple's chief executive in August, 2011 because of his health. He died a day after the company released a new iPhone version that met with limited excitement. Steve left behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. \n\nPresident Obama said in a statement: by building one of the planet's most successful companies from his garage, Steve Jobs showed the spirit of American ingenuity . By making computers personal and putting the Internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible but intuitive and fun. \n\nThe fact that he was able to redesign American commerce top to bottom and across is really astonishing.

Some do, scientists say, according to a report by Science News in early 2010. Guillermo P. Murphy and Susan Dudley are two plant scientists from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. They did a few experiments with Jewelweeds, a kind of flower that grows in wet, shady spots. They found that the flowers seem to know their own flower family. In their experiments, Murphy and Dudley planted jewelweeds in pots with either _ or strangers. When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers, the plants started to grow more leaves than if they had been planted alone. This response suggests that plants are competing with strangers for sunlight, since a plant with more leaves can receive more light and make more food. Jewelweeds usually grow in the shade, where sunlight is not enough. When jewelweed seedlings were planted with siblings, they grew a few more branches than they usually would if they were alone - but they did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior suggests the plants are more likely to share resources, rather than compete. According to the Science News report, Jewelweeds are not the first plants that plant scientists have studied for family recognition. In 2007, Dudley and her team studied the Great Lakes sea rocket, a plant that grows on the beach - where it may be hard to get fresh water. In that experiment, the scientists found that when sea rockets were planted with siblings, they tolerated each other. But when they were planted with strangers, the sea rockets reacted by working extra hard to grow lots of roots. Dudley says this just because sea rockets, on the beach, get plenty of sun but struggle for water - so when they're threatened, they compete for water. Jewelweeds have plenty of water but have to compete for sunshine, so they grow more leaves.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who are Guillermo P.

Clare, who had not eaten much, sat opposite, watching him. His pose as he leaned back with a wineglass in his hand was negligently graceful, and his white clothes, drawn in at the waist by a black silk sash, showed his well-knit figure. There were touches of gray in his hair and wrinkles round his eyes, but in spite of this he had a look of careless youth. Clare, however, thought she noticed a hint of preoccupation that she knew and disliked. \n\nPresently Kenwardine picked out an envelope with a British stamp from among the rest and turned it over before inserting a knife behind the flap, which yielded easily, as if the gum had lost its strength. Then he took out the letter and smiled with ironical amusement. If it had been read by any unauthorized person before it reached him, the reader would have been much misled, but it told him what he wanted to know. There was one word an Englishman or American would not have used, though a Teuton might have done so, but Kenwardine thought a Spaniard would not notice this, even if he knew English well.

They spent two days beginning the task of formulating ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing. \n\n\"Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,\" said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. \"Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,\" he added. \n\nPhotographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. \"This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column there that used to be part of that building,\" explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. \"The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.\" \n\nThe visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris to survive. \"Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance,\" he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\" said A. Whittaker. \"We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it.\" \n\nA. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that \"earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design.
