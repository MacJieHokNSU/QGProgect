But his fame came late in his life. \n\nHe was born in San Francisco, California in 1874. He lived in California during his early childhood. He was named after the chief Southern general in America's Civil War. The general's name was Robert Edward Lee. The poet was named Robert Lee Frost, because his father wanted to honor the general. \n\nSomeone once asked another American writer, Ernest Hemingway, how to become a writer. The best thing, he said, was to have an unhappy childhood. If this is true, Robert Frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very good writer. Robert Frost's father was a reporter who wanted to be a politician. He often drank too much wine and became angry. Robert was the victim of his anger. \n\nRobert Frost finished high school in 1891. After high school, Robert's grandfather offered to pay his costs at Dartmouth College. But Robert left the school after a few months. He did not like it. He spent the next few years working at different jobs. At one time, he worked in a factory. Later, he repaired shoes. He was a teacher. He was a reporter. Always, he wrote poetry. \n\nRobert Frost attended Harvard University for two years. After that, he returned to the many jobs he held before. For a while, Frost tried to take care of a farm in the state of New Hampshire. He was not a successful farmer. And he continued to write poetry. He said that until 1930, he earned only about ten dollars a year from writing. \n\nIn 1912, he decided to try to make a new start. He took his family to Britain. The cost of living was low. In Britain, Frost found a publisher for his first book of poems. The book was called A Boy's Will. When it appeared in 1913. Frost received high praise from British readers. Praise was something he had not received in his own country. \n\nEzra Pound, another American poet living in Britain, read the poems and liked them very much. He wrote a magazine article about Frost. He also helped get Frost's second book of poems published in America. That book was called North of Boston.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which one of America's best known writers is this story about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was he named after?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was Robert Lee famous for?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "So, why was Frost named after him?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And where did Frost live as a young child?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was he also born there?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "In which year?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Why did he quit Dartmouth?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he have a happy childhood?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many years did he go to Harvard?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did he do in New Hampshire?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What did he write?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What was published in 1913?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did people like it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who wrote an article about him?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was the name of the book that he helped Frost get published?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What did Hemingway say about becoming a writer?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who offered to pay Frost's way at Dartmouth?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did did he graduate high school?", "turn_id": 19, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Was he ever a reporter like his father?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 77, "span_text": "Robert Frost was one of America's best known and most honored serious writers", "input_text": "Robert Frost", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 218, "span_end": 330, "span_text": "He was named after the chief Southern general in America's Civil War.

The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends. Zhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey. \"I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it. It's great that the duck is in Beijing,\" Zhao said.

Use it anytime you come across a word or passage you don't understand. \n\nWhat users enjoy most is the program's ability to open up a different world to them. Whether it's surfing a news site in a different country, or being able to properly communicate with a family member or friend overseas, Babylon can make it happen. \n\nBest of all, Babylon is free!

However, the United States Constitution has always been silent on the issue of political parties; at the time it was signed in 1787, there were no parties in the nation. Indeed, no nation in the world had voter-based political parties. The need to win popular support in a republic led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s. Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party. \n\nPolitical scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras. The first two-party system consisted of the Federalist Party, who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the Democratic-Republican Party or the Anti-Federalists, who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789. \n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Several third parties also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office. The largest third party since the 1980s is the Libertarian Party. \n\nThe United States Constitution Is silent on the subject of political parties. The Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan.

He needed to use a nebulizer, a machine that helps send medicine quickly to the lungs, to get his breathing back to normal. \n\nAsthma attacks like Jeremy increase in September and October. More than six times as many asthma sufferers who are elementary-school age need hospital treatment in the fall as in the summer. \n\nExperts believe many factors can contribute to back-to-school asthma. Kids get together in close spaces, they start passing viruses around. A viral infection can cause an asthma attack. There are also certain fall allergies that can cause attacks. Exercise is another common cause of an attack. Besides, the stress of school can make asthma worse. \n\nParents can play a big role in helping kids with asthma start the school year right. Dawne Gee's10-year-old son, Alexander, has had asthma since he was a baby. Before the school year starts, she tells school workers in writing about her son's asthma. \n\nThe Gees live in Kentucky, which has passed laws allowing students to carry their asthma medication with them at school. Alexander's mom makes sure he has his inhaler with him when he goes to school and that he keeps it on hand at all times. In Delaware, where Jeremy lives, kids are allowed to carry their inhalers at school. \n\nThe American Lung Association says that about 6.2 million American children suffer from asthma. Asthma is the chronic illness that causes students to miss the most days of school. There are many things that schools can do to help students control their asthma", "questions": [{"input_text": "In what months do the number of asthma attacks increase?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Can viral infections trigger attacks?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is one other trigger for an attack?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Stress arising from what can cause an attack?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old is Jeremy?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is his last name?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "In what month was his latest attack?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "On what day?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "This this attack occur after a class?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Which one?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did the students power walk in this class?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What are the two other exercises mentioned for this class?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What machine does he need to use?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does is send medicine to a particular organ?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Which one?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is the name of Gee's son?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How old is he?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Since when has he had asthma?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is Mrs. Gee's first name?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "In what state do the Gees live?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 481, "span_end": 514, "span_text": "increase in September and October", "input_text": "September and October", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 831, "span_text": " A viral infection can cause an asthma attack", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 848, "span_end": 869, "span_text": "certain fall allergie", "input_text": "certain fall allergies", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 951, "span_end": 973, "span_text": "the stress of school c", "input_text": "school", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 17, "span_text": "Jeremy Wirick, 9,", "input_text": "Nine", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 7, "span_end": 13, "span_text": "Wirick", "input_text": "Wirick", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 143, "span_end": 153, "span_text": "October 2,", "input_text": "October", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 150, "span_end": 152, "span_text": " 2", "input_text": "2nd", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 154, "span_end": 199, "span_text": "after he pushed himself too hard in gym class", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 190, "span_end": 199, "span_text": "gym class", "input_text": "gym", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 223, "span_text": "power walking", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 225, "span_end": 245, "span_text": "jogging and push-ups", "input_text": "jogging and push-ups", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 331, "span_end": 356, "span_text": "needed to use a nebulizer", "input_text": "nebulizer", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 401, "span_end": 413, "span_text": "to the lungs", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 404, "span_end": 413, "span_text": "the lungs", "input_text": "the lungs", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1109, "span_end": 1119, "span_text": " Alexander", "input_text": "Alexander", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1093, "span_end": 1108, "span_text": "10-year-old son", "input_text": "10", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1136, "span_end": 1157, "span_text": "since he was a baby.

The squire had written to him a letter inviting him to Tretton, and telling him that it would be the best home for him till death should have put Tretton into other hands. Mountjoy had thought the matter over, sitting in the easy-chair in his brother's room, and had at last declined the invitation. As his letter was emblematic of the man, it may be as well to give it to the reader: \n\n\"My dear father,--I don't think it will suit me to go down to Tretton at present. I don't mind the cards, and I don't doubt that you would make it better than this place. But, to tell the truth, I don't believe a word of what you have told to the world about my mother, and some of these days I mean to have it out with Augustus. I shall not sit quietly by and see Tretton taken out of my mouth. Therefore I think I had better not go to Tretton. \n\n\"Yours truly, \n\n\"MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH.\" \n\nThis had not at all surprised the father, and had not in the least angered him. He rather liked his son for standing up for his mother, and was by no means offended at the expression of his son's incredulity. But what was there in the prospect of a future lawsuit to prevent his son coming to Tretton? There need be no word spoken as to the property. Tretton would be infinitely more comfortable than those rooms in Victoria Street, and he was aware that the hospitality of Victoria Street would not be given in an ungrudging spirit. \"I shouldn't like it,\" said the old squire to himself as he lay quiet on his sofa. \"I shouldn't like at all to be the humble guest of Augustus.

In the same place on the political spectrum as its sister papers \"the Guardian\" and the \"Guardian Weekly\", whose parent company Guardian Media Group Limited acquired it in 1993, it takes a social liberal or social democratic line on most issues. First published in 1791, it is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper. \n\nThe first issue, published on 4 December 1791 by W.S. Bourne, was the world's first Sunday newspaper. Believing that the paper would be a means of wealth, Bourne instead soon found himself facing debts of nearly \u00a31,600. Though early editions purported editorial independence, Bourne attempted to cut his losses and sell the title to the government. When this failed, Bourne's brother (a wealthy businessman) made an offer to the government, which also refused to buy the paper but agreed to subsidise it in return for influence over its editorial content. As a result, the paper soon took a strong line against radicals such as Thomas Paine, Francis Burdett and Joseph Priestley. \n\nIn 1807, the brothers decided to relinquish editorial control, naming Lewis Doxat as the new editor. Seven years later, the brothers sold \"The Observer\" to William Innell Clement, a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications. The paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period; in 1819, of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly, approximately 10,000 were given away as \"specimen copies\", distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to \"lawyers, doctors, and gentlemen of the town.\" Yet the paper began to demonstrate a more independent editorial stance, criticising the authorities' handling of the events surrounding the Peterloo Massacre and defying an 1820 court order against publishing details of the trial of the Cato Street Conspirators, who were alleged to have plotted to murder members of the Cabinet.

Among them were Will Osten and his friends, with the clergyman's wife and daughter. \n\nPoor Wandering Will was very unhappy. The sunshine was bright, the natives were blithe, and the birds were joyous, but our hero was despondent! The fact was that he had fallen head and ears in love with Flora Westwood, and he felt that he might as well have fallen in love with the moon--as far as any chance of getting married to her was concerned. Will was therefore very miserable, and, like all ardent and very youthful lovers, he hugged his misery to his bosom--rather enjoyed it, in fact, than otherwise. In short, if truth must be told, he took pleasure in being miserable _for her sake_! When he allowed himself to take romantic views of the subject, and thought of the heights of bliss that _might_ be attained, he was, so to speak, miserably happy. When he looked the stern realities in the face, he was miserably sad. \n\nThat Sabbath morning poor Will felt more impressed than ever with the hopelessness of his case, as he walked slowly and silently to church beside the modest Flora and her mother. He also became impressed with the ridiculousness of his position, and determined to \"overcome his weakness.\" He therefore looked at Flora with the intention of cutting a joke of some sort, but, suddenly recollecting that it was Sunday, he checked himself. Then he thought of getting into a serious talk, and was about to begin, when his eye happened to fall on Thackombau, who, in honour of the day, had got himself up with unusual care, having covered his shoulders with a cotton jacket, his loins with a lady's shawl, and his head with a white night-cap--his dark tatooed legs forming a curious and striking contrast to the whole.

It was Santa Claus, he realized. Bunny jumped out of bed and ran down the hall to the stairs. He hoped to take a look at the old man before Santa left for his next stop. By the time Bunny was at the bottom of the stairs, everything was silent again. Lots of presents were put under the Christmas tree, but Santa was gone. A little disappointed , Bunny turned to climb back upstairs when he heard a cry. \"Hello,\" said Bunny. \"Is somebody there?\" He was answered by another cry. Bunny looked around the big pile of presents to see what was making the noise. Right under the tree was a funny looking brown animal with big feet and sad eyes. It also had antlers on its head. Bunny almost mistook it for a dog. \"Are you a reindeer?\" asked Bunny. \"Yes,\" replied the brown animal with antlers. \"My name is Ralph.\" \"And you were pulling Santa's sled ?\" \"I was until I got air-sick,\" replied Ralph. \"Santa had to leave me here and go on with the other seven reindeer.\" \"Isn't it a bit unusual for a reindeer to get air-sick? I mean, isn't flying what reindeer are famous for?\" \"Not me, I'm afraid. It makes me scared. I always feel sick when it comes to flying,\" replied Ralph. \"But everyone wanted me to pull Santa's sled, so when it was my turn I gave it a try. I'm afraid I just wasn't _ for the job. Now I'm stuck here and I don't know how to get back to the North Pole.\" \"Well, if you like, you can stay with us as a friend,\" said Bunny.

It is the capital and the center of Lublin Voivodeship (\"province\") with a population of 349,103 (March 2011). Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River, and is located approximately to the southeast of Warsaw by road. \n\nOne of the events that greatly contributed to the city's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385. Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Krak\u00f3w; the inhabitants also had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.

It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital. Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. \n\nWashington is the 18th largest state with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along Puget Sound , an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers.

By studying hard, she graduated successfully in 1849. \n\nAfter graduating from medical school, she went to Paris to learn more about medicine. She wanted to be a surgeon, but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea. \n\nWhen she returned to America in 1851, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman. In 1857, Elizabeth and her sister, also a doctor, along with another woman doctor, managed to open a new hospital, the first for women and children. Besides, she also set up the first medical school for women in 1868, where she taught the women students about disease prevention. It was the first time that the idea of preventing disease was taught in a medical school. \n\nElizabeth Blackwell started the British National Health Society in 1871, which helped people learn how to stay healthy.

Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving \"Swaraj\" or self-rule. \n\nGandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to \"Quit India\" in 1942.

It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. \n\nInstead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \"Do the Right Thing\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n\nTwenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,\" he wrote in 2001. \n\nSo what is the thing about \"Do the Right Thing?\" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words \u00bb \n\nPart of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) and \"School Daze\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.

Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: spacetime, physical energies and forces, dark matter, and so on. Thus the term \"physicalism\" is preferred over \"materialism\" by some, while others use the terms as if they are synonymous. \n\nMaterialism belongs to the class of monist ontology. As such, it is different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. \n\nDespite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: \"what does reality consist of?\" and \"how does it originate?\" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary.

The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord\u2014a space and time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need. \n\nThe show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film. The programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies, who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff.

But an early review in The New York Times ensured that the book would be noticed. \"It's as if, in writing it, she broke through the ordinary human condition with all its dissatisfactions, and achieved a kind of transfiguration ,\" wrote Anatole Broyard, with an enthusiasm and amazement that was shared by many critics and readers. The book became a classic, and Robinson was recognized as one of the outstanding American writers of our time. Yet it would be more than twenty years before she wrote another novel. \n\nDuring the period, Robinson devoted herself to writing nonfiction. Her essays and book reviews appeared in Harper's and The New York Times Book Review, and in 1989 she published Mother Country: Britain, the Welfare State, and Nuclear Pollution, criticizing severely the environmental and public health dangers caused by the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in England--and the political and moral corruption . In 1998, Robinson published a collection of her critical and theological writings, The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought, which featured reassessments of such figures as Charles Darwin, John Calvin, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Aside from a single short story--\"Connie Bronson,\" published in The Paris Review in 1986--it wasn't until 2004 that she returned to fiction with the novel Gilead, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Her third novel, Home, came out this fall. \n\nHer novels could be described as celebrations of the human--the characters in them are unforgettable creations. Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her sister Lucille, who are cared for by their eccentric Aunt Sylvie after their mother commits suicide. Robinson writes a lot about how each of the three is changed by their new life together. Gilead is an even more close exploration of personality: the book centres on John Ames, a seventy-seven-year-old pastor who is writing an account of his life and his family history to leave to his young son after he dies. Home borrows characters from Gilead but centers on Ames's friend Reverend Robert Boughton and his troubled son Jack. Robinson returned to the same territory as Gilead because, she said, \"after I write a novel or a story, I miss the characters--I feel like losing some close friends.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which book by Robinson is about Ruth and her sister Lucille?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was it written?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many years passed before she wrote another novel?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did she write in between?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did she publish in 1989?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And where did some of her essays and book reviews show up?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did she publish in 1998?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What figures did it reassess?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What single short story did she write?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did Anatole Broyard say about Housekeeping?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who published Connie Bronson?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When did Robinson start writing fiction again?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was the name of the novel she wrote then?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When does her novel, Home, come out?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What happens to Ruth and Lucille's mother in Housekeeping?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who takes care of them then?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does the book Gilead center on?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How old is Ames?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is he writing his book for?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1666, "span_end": 1722, "span_text": "Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her sister Lucille", "input_text": "Housekeeping.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 15, "span_end": 72, "span_text": "Robinson published her first novel, Housekeeping, in 1980", "input_text": "1980.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 559, "span_end": 626, "span_text": "it would be more than twenty years before she wrote another novel.

Dance.\" \n\n'DWTS' thinks big for 17th season cast \n\nHarper announced in March that she had been diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a condition in which cancer cells spread into the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. But Harper told CNN that she does not have brain cancer. \n\n\"I have lung cancer,\" she said. \"It is situated in the lining of the brain; it's not even in the brain.\" \n\nHer husband, Tony Cacciotti, encouraged her to sign on with the hit ABC dance competition, she said. He runs the couple's production company and had been considering her participation for a few years. \n\nThe actress said she initially resisted the idea. \n\n\"I said, 'Give me one good reason,' \" Harper recalled. \"He said, 'You have cancer! Get up there, and show people that you can dance and do -- and the doctors said it's fine to exercise. Encourage people to move, to exercise, to do all the things that will be good for them, and mainly not to sit in the house and glower and worry and feel sorry for yourself because you have this

industrial city that borders scandal-plagued Bell, on three felony counts after an investigation into questionable business practices. \n\nCourt documents show that Donal O'Callaghan has been indicted on two counts of conflict of interest and a count of public officer crime related to the misappropriation of public funds. \n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office says the counts against

The ancient Babylonians pressed the tips of their fingerprints into clay to record business trade. The Chinese used ink-on-paper finger impressions for business. However, fingerprinting wasn't used as a method for identifying criminals until the 19th century. \n\nIn 1858, Sir William Herschel was working as an official of the Hooghly district in Jungipoor, India.In order to reduce fraud , he had people living in the district record their fingerprints when signing business documents. A few years later, Scottish doctor Henry Faulds was working in Japan when he discovered fingerprints left by artists on ancient pieces of clay.This finding inspired him to begin investigating fingerprints.In 1880, Faulds wrote to his cousin, the famous naturalist Charles Darwin, and asked for help with developing a fingerprint classification system.Darwin refused, but sent the letter to his cousin, Sir Francis Gallon, who was an eugenicist . Gallon began collecting fingerprints and eventually gathered some 8, 000 different samples to analyze. In 1892, he published a book called \"Fingerprints\", in which he outlined a fingerprint classification system--the first existence. \n\nAround the same time, Juan Vucetich, a police officer in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was developing his own version of a fingerprinting system.In 1892, Vucetich was called in to assist with the investigation of the two boys murdered in Necoche, a village near Buenos Aires. Their mother, Francisca Rojas, accused a neighbour named Velasquez. But when Vucetich compared the fingerprints found at the murder scene to those of both Velasquez and Rojas, _ matched Rojas' exactly.She admitted her crime. This was the first time fingerprints had been used in a criminal investigation.Vucetich called his system comparative dactyloscopy . It's still used in many Spanish-speaking countries. \n\nSir Edward Henry, in charge of the Metropolitan Police of London, soon became interested in using fingerprints to catch criminals. In 1896, he added to Gallon's technique, creating his own classification system, the Henry Classification System. It is the primary method of fingerprint classification throughout most of the world.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When were fingerprints first used for business?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did the Chinese use for business impressions?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was fingerprinting done for criminals?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was Henry Faulds profession?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who is his cousin?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "After Darwin declined the work offer, who did he reccomend to work with Faulds", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was his profession?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Gallon publish?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was it about?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who else was interested in Fingerprints", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 63, "span_end": 83, "span_text": " ancient Babylonians", "input_text": "ancient Babylonia", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 176, "span_end": 188, "span_text": "ink-on-paper", "input_text": "ink-on-paper", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 306, "span_end": 318, "span_text": "19th century", "input_text": "19th century", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 367, "span_end": 378, "span_text": "an official", "input_text": "an official", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 825, "span_text": " Charles Darwin,", "input_text": "Charles Darwin", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 948, "span_end": 966, "span_text": "Sir Francis Gallon", "input_text": "Sir Francis Gallon", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 979, "span_end": 990, "span_text": "eugenicist ", "input_text": "eugenicist", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1130, "span_end": 1145, "span_text": " \"Fingerprints\"", "input_text": "\"Fingerprints\"", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1170, "span_end": 1203, "span_text": "fingerprint classification system", "input_text": "the fingerprint classification system", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1250, "span_end": 1263, "span_text": "Juan Vucetich", "input_text": "Juan Vucetich", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high2976.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3g0wwmr1uvkoebz8goqwf8sd6njqn5", "filename": "high7970.txt", "story": "There was once a beautiful nymph called Echo. But Echo had one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument, would have the last word. As she was good company, she and Zeus became good friends. However, Zeus' wife, Hera, became jealous. She followed Zeus to the earth to find out what he was doing and Zeus asked Echo to distract Hera until he could escape. Later when Hera discovered she had been tricked, she became very angry. She turned on Echo and said, \"You shall lose the use of your tongue because you cheated me. You'll have the last word, bur no longer have the power to speak first.\" So from that moment on, Beautiful Echo was hardly able to hold a conversation because she could only repeat the last words of those around her. She became very embarrassed and hid herself deep in the woods. \n\nOne day a handsome young man called Narcissus came into the woods. He had been hunting deer and lost his way. However, the moment Echo saw him, she fell in love with him. She followed him, wishing to tell him but unable to begin a conversation. Oh, how she wished she could speak first. Unfortunately, Narcissus was far too busy worrying about where his companions might be and how he could find his way home. \n\nEventually Narcissus, with Echo following behind along, came to a pool of water in the middle of the woods. Feeling thirsty, Narcissus bent down to drink. As he did so, he saw a beautiful creature in the water staring up at him. He immediately bent over and said to him, \"I love you!\" Echo, nearby, and seeing her chance, immediately responded \".... I love you!\" But it was too late. Narcissus was already in love, with himself. \n\nThe stranger seemed to rise up closer to Narcissus who was so involved that he entirely failed to notice Echo. \"I want to stay and look at this beautiful sight forever,\" he whispered dreamily to himself.\"... Forever,\" repeated Echo sadly. \"Come here,\" called Narcissus to his reflection as he moved his head and the creature seemed to move away. \"...Here.\" responded Echo. Narcissus bent back down to see his reflection more clearly. \"So beautiful! I've never seen anything so beautiful!\" \"....So beautiful!\" responded Echo truthfully. \n\nNarcissus remained by the water refusing all Echo's silent offers of food and drink until he died. Where he had been, a flower grew in his place, as beautiful as Narcissus himself. As for Echo, from that time forward, she also didn't eat or drink till she turned to rocks and all that was left was her voice.

Some Parisians have even started to go to work in London. In the 19thcentury, Charles Dickens compared the two great rival cities, London and Paris, in \"A Tale of Two Cities.\" These days, it might be A Tale of One City. Parisians are these days likely to smile in sympathy at a visitor's broken French and respond in polite English. As jobs grew lack at home over recent years, perhaps 250,000 Frenchmen moved across the Channel. With an undersea tunnel, they could travel between cities in three hours. The European Union freed them from immigration and customs. Paris, rich in beauty, is more attractive. But Londonfeels more full of life, and more fun until the pubs shut down. \"For me, the difference is that Londonis real, alive,\" said Trevor Wheeler, a banker. Chantal Jaouen, a professional designer, agrees. \"I am French, but I'll stay in London,\" she said. There is, of course, the other view. Julie Lenoux is a student who moved to Londontwo years ago. \"I think people laugh more inParis,\" she said. In fact, London and Paris, with their obvious new similarities, are beyond the cold descriptions. As the European Union gradually loosened controls, Londoners _ intoParisto shop, eat and buy property. \"Both cities have changed beyond recognition.\" Said Larry Collins, a writer and sometimes a Londoner. Like most people who know both well, he finds the two now fit together comfortably. \"I first fell in love with Parisin the 1950s, and it is still a wonderful place,\" Collins said. \"But if I had to choose, it would be London. Things are so much more ordered, and life is better.\" But certainly not cheaper. In fancy parts of London, rents can be twice those on Avenue Foch in Paris. Deciding between London and Parisrequires a lifestyle choice. Like Daphne Benoit, a French journalism student with perfect English, many young people are happy to be close enough so they don't have to choose. \"I love Paris, my little neighborhood, the way I can walk around a centre, but life is so structured,\" she said. \"InLondon, you can be who you want.

Before his journey, no one knew Greenland's size or shape. On Peary's first trips, he explored Greenland, mapping parts of it. \n\nWhen Peary returned to the United States, he went to a businessman to sell some furs. There he met Matthew Henson, an African American mechanic, builder and navigator. When Peary went to Nicaragua on a Navy mission ,Henson went with him. When that job was over, the two headed to the Arctic. \n\nHenson and Peary set sail for Greenland. When they landed, Henson built a house for their base camp. Peary and his men set out to explore the land by dog sledge . Henson was injured and had to stay at the base. While there, he made friends with the Inuit, the native people. \n\nIn 1895 Henson, Peary and Hugh Lee went out on another dog sledge journey. This time, they found Greenland's northernmost point. They now knew that the North Pole lay under the frozen Arctic Ocean. Peary had hoped to cross the ice. but the group ran out of food and returned to base camp. In the years that followed, Peary and Henson tried several times to reach the North Pole, but each time they failed. On one trip, Peary's feet froze, and he lost his toes . \n\nPeary and Henson planned last trip when Peary was 53 years old. They started across the sea ice from Ellesmere Island, which is located north of Canada. The temperature dropped as low as--51 degrees Celsius.

Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \"computer vision syndrome .\" Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\" he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\" he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\" Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two. But not all eye doctors have noticed an increase in problems in children. Dr. David Hunter, from Children's Hospital Boston, has not seen an increase in his practice. \"While it is possible to develop _ looking at screens for a long period of time, there's certainly no proof that it actually causes any damage to the eyes.\" he says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What do kids spend hours a day looking at?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where is the doctor located?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Does he see more computer related eye problems?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who's worried?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Why won't they tell their parents?", "turn_id": 5}], "answers": [{"span_start": 39, "span_end": 85, "span_text": "at computer screens and other digital devices ", "input_text": "at computer screens and other digital devices", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 207, "span_end": 224, "span_text": "in Tampa, Florida", "input_text": "in Tampa, Florida", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 368, "span_end": 499, "span_text": " have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,", "input_text": "have headaches or red or wateryiscomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 286, "span_end": 296, "span_text": " children ", "input_text": "children", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 770, "span_end": 851, "span_text": " because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,", "input_text": "because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,", "turn_id": 5}], "name": "middle404.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3a9aa95atwmzoasncbfllm2h90bp5o", "filename": "cnn_ca1cb9876a7fa032050fd650ab9c8818663f9931.story", "story": "(InStyle.com) -- Style, beauty and a certain je ne sais quoi is in the genes for these ultra-glamorous mother/daughter duos. \n\nGoldie Hawn and Kate Hudson \n\nGoldie made a name for herself starring in romantic comedies that highlighted her sense of humor as well as her acting chops. \n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same exact career trajectory her gorgeous daughter Kate Hudson chose to take.

The territory comprises the three islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman located south of Cuba, northeast of Costa Rica, north of Panama, east of Mexico and northwest of Jamaica. Its population is approximately , and its capital is George Town. \n\nThe Cayman Islands are considered to be part of the geographic Western Caribbean Zone as well as the Greater Antilles. The territory is often considered a major world offshore financial haven for many wealthy individuals. \n\nThe Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including pirates, shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from Oliver Cromwell's army in Jamaica. The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655. \n\nEngland took formal control of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the Treaty of Madrid of 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the Governor of Jamaica in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves. Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1833. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 Blacks of African ancestry enslaved by 116 white families of English ancestry.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was the island first get settlers?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was the first official resident?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was he born there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "In which of the islands?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many more islands constitute the whole?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which are the two main other isles?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What geographical zone are they in?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "In what year was it taken control of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who took power?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Were slaves ever used there?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "In what year did they begin bringing them in?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "For how long did the practice continue?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 645, "span_end": 657, "span_text": "17th century", "input_text": "17th century", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 978, "span_end": 991, "span_text": "Isaac Bodden,", "input_text": "Isaac Bodden,", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 996, "span_end": 1016, "span_text": "born on Grand Cayman", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1004, "span_end": 1016, "span_text": "Grand Cayman", "input_text": "Grand Cayman", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 128, "span_end": 141, "span_text": "three islands", "input_text": "2 more", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 159, "span_end": 188, "span_text": "Cayman Brac and Little Cayman", "input_text": "Cayman Brac and Little Cayman", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 426, "span_end": 443, "span_text": "Western Caribbean", "input_text": "Western Caribbean", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1284, "span_end": 1288, "span_text": "1670", "input_text": "1670", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1174, "span_end": 1181, "span_text": "England", "input_text": "England", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1516, "span_end": 1542, "span_text": " perceived need for slaves", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1502, "span_end": 1506, "span_text": "1734", "input_text": "1734", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1891, "span_end": 1895, "span_text": "1833", "input_text": "about 99 years", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "Cayman_Islands.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3iaeqb9fmekkcw4h33bzbsy5gjcwd9", "filename": "high7527.txt", "story": "A brother and sister have been reunited after more than 60 years, thanks to a letter in the Welwyn and Hatfield Times. \n\nFor years John Hannant Kept a photograph of his long-lost sister, hoping they would meet again.

Richards IV was convicted of rape, the wealthy heir to the du Pont family fortune was spared prison by a Delaware court in 2009 because he would \"not fare well\" behind bars, according to court documents CNN obtained Tuesday. \n\nRichards is a great-grandson of the chemical magnate Irenee du Pont. \n\nHe received an eight-year prison sentence in 2009 for raping his toddler daughter, but the sentencing order signed by a Delaware judge said \"defendant will not fare well\" in prison and the eight years were suspended. \n\nRichards was placed on eight years' probation and ordered to get treatment and register as a sex offender, the documents show. He was also prohibited from having contact with children under 16, including his own children. \n\nThe documents were never sealed, yet the ruling managed to go unnoticed until March, when Richards' former wife, Tracy Richards, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court on behalf of their children alleging \"personal injuries arising from the childhood sexual abuse.\" The 11-page suit alleges that not only was their daughter abused, but Richards abused their son, too.

While encompassing a broad range of ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality. \n\nThe term \"postmodernism\" has been applied both to the era following modernity and to a host of movements within that era (mainly in art, music, and literature) that reacted against tendencies in modernism. Postmodernism includes skeptical critical interpretations of culture, literature, art, philosophy, history, linguistics, economics, architecture, fiction, feminist theory, and literary criticism. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism, as well as philosophers such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, and Frederic Jameson. \n\nThe term \"postmodern\" was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested \"a Postmodern style of painting\" as a way to depart from French Impressionism. J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in \"The Hibbert Journal\" (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of religion, writing: \"The raison d'\u00eatre of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of Modernism by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as theology, to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was the term first used?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who suggested a postmodern style of painting?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who wrote The Hibbert Journal?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is postmodernism defined as?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Has it been applied to art?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What philosophers is it associated with?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What schools of thought is it associated with?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is it applied to literature?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it applied to music?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was it developed?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How is post modern thought characterized?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1486, "span_end": 1539, "span_text": "The term \"postmodern\" was first used around the 1880s", "input_text": "around the 1880s", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1540, "span_end": 1604, "span_text": " John Watkins Chapman suggested \"a Postmodern style of painting\"", "input_text": "John Watkins Chapman", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1651, "span_end": 1711, "span_text": "J.

It will be held at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. \n\nGandolfini, 51, died last week while on a working vacation in Rome. He arrived there with his son, Michael, the day before he died. \n\n\"Jim was happy, he was healthy, he was doing really fine,\" Kobold said recently. \"He was on vacation with his son.

Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. \n\nDavid Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. \n\nBuick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. \n\nDurant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \"Boo-ick,\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. \n\nIn another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \"Hupp\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s.

Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous.

While Nora's mother, Martha, loves sitting down with a good book and reading carefully, her daughter may be the wave of the future. \"Deep reading\", or slow reading, is a process in which people think carefully while they read. With most, that means slowing down --- even stopping and rereading a page or paragraph to really understand what the author is trying to say. Last summer, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was concerned about what he sees as a decline in slow reading. Instant messages and 140-character tweets appear to be reducing out ability to concentrate on a single idea or theme of a book, he told Foreign Policy Magazine. It's easy to forget the benefits of deep reading in an age when anything worth doing is done fast. Experts warn that without deep reading, it is impossible to be an educated person of the world, a knowledgeable voter or even an imaginative thinker. \"If you want to have a deep relationship with a text and understand a complex idea, then slow reading is a preferred style. It is good for pleasure, too. It is not a rushed experience and you can lose yourself in a text,\" said Canadian writer John Miedema, the author of the book Slow Reading. US' Ohlone College English professor Cynthia Lee Katona says reading is a highly social activity that builds the mind and social connections. If you read, she says, you simply know more and have more to talk about with friends, partners and people you know. Deep reading can also take a reader on a trip around the world even if they are sitting in a living room armchair, Katona says.

This presently took the form of \"daring.\" \n\nDaring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just then. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were \"dared\" to do them would fill a book by themselves. \n\nFirst of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis, albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the aforesaid Carrie Sloane.

The work's coverage of American and Canadian geography and history has been a traditional strength. Written by 6,500 contributors, the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" includes over 9,000 bibliographies, 150,000 cross-references, 1,000+ tables, 1,200 maps, and almost 4,500 black-and-white line art and color images. It also has 680 factboxes. Most articles are signed by their contributors. \n\nLong available as a 30-volume print set, the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" is now marketed as an online encyclopedia requiring a subscription. In March 2008, Scholastic said that print sales remained good but that the company was still deciding on the future of the print edition. The company did not produce an edition in 2007, a change from its previous approach of releasing a revised print edition each year. The most recent print edition of the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" was published in 2006. \n\nThe online version of the \"Encyclopedia Americana\", first introduced in 1997, continues to be updated and sold.

Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a _ like Mickey. \n\nIn the 1930s, 40s and 50s Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational films about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared---there were no more new cartoons. \n\nClarence Nash died in February, 1985.

He felt himself unable to go alone, and was therefore willing that the bygones of the ship should be bygones. Caldigate, on the other hand, acknowledged to himself that he owed some reparation to his companion. Of course he had not bound himself to any special mode of life;--but had he, in his present condition, allied himself more closely to Mrs. Smith, he would, to some extent, have thrown Dick over. And then, as soon as he was on shore, he did feel somewhat ashamed of himself in regard to Mrs. Smith. Was it not manifest that any closer alliance, let the alliance be what it might, must be ruinous to him? As it was, had he not made an absolute fool of himself with Mrs. Smith? Had he not got himself already into a mess from which there was no escape? Of course he must write to her when the month was over.

It's a windfall for us newsdealers, as well as a glorious victory to match. It makes me think of my old war days, when I was aboard of the _Carondelet_ under Captain Walke. We didn't sink so many ships as Dewey has at Manila, but we sank some, and smashed many a shore battery in the bargain, along the banks of the Mississippi. What does that extra have to say?\" and Phil Newell, the one-legged civil-war naval veteran, who was also proprietor of the news-stand, took the sheet which Walter Russell, his clerk, handed out. \n\n\"There is not much additional news as yet,\" answered Walter. \"One of the sensational papers has it that Dewey is now bombarding Manila, but the news is not confirmed. But it is true that our squadron sunk every one of the Spanish warships,--and that, I reckon, is enough for one victory.\" \n\n\"True, my lad, true; but there is nothing like keeping at 'em, when you have 'em on the run. That is the way we did down South. Perhaps Dewey is waiting for additional instructions from Washington. I hope he didn't suffer much of a loss.

Musicians use the guitar for almost all kinds of music. Country and western music would not be the same without a guitar. The traditional Spanish folk music called Flamenco could not exist without a guitar. The sound of American blues music would not be the same without the sad cry of the guitar. And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. \n\nMusic experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. \n\nMany famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. \n\nIn the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different. Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music. Listen to this Les Paul recording. It was the fifth most popular song in the United States in 1952.

It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area, officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA. The city is bordered to the west by the Elizabeth River and to the north by the Chesapeake Bay. It also shares land borders with the independent cities of Chesapeake to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. Norfolk is one of the oldest cities in Hampton Roads, and is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region. \n\nThe city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest Navy base in the world, Naval Station Norfolk, is located in Norfolk along with one of NATO's two Strategic Command headquarters.

John McCain was against the president's plan for limited intervention but on Wednesday changed his mind. Sen. Marco Rubio was for intervention in Syria for the past two years, but he cannot support Obama's plan for military strikes. \n\nOn the Democratic side, many who have previously defended Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to his predecessor for its caution and thoughtfulness now seem delighted to support his new war in Syria. Then there are Democrats who seem a little less fuzzy on their long-held principles and do not support intervening in Syria. \n\nObama's own administration seems confused as well. Secretary of State John Kerry has had to backpedal more than once after contradicting official policy in Syria, which is admittedly hard to discern. \n\nEven Gen.

Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses. \n\nIn the Georgian era, Brighton developed as a fashionable seaside resort, encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent, later King George IV, who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era. Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841, becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London. Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era, including the Grand Hotel, the West Pier, and the Brighton Palace Pier.

He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day. \n\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of Fran\u00e7ois Arouet (19 August 1649 \u2013 1 January 1722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c. 1660 \u2013 13 July 1701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Gu\u00e9rin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothers\u2014Armand-Fran\u00e7ois and Robert\u2014died in infancy and his surviving brother, Armand, and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively. Nicknamed 'Zozo' by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with , and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand (1704\u20131711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric; later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Was this writer's mother of high ranking birth?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is this writers birth name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "and his nickname?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "was he a lazy writer?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "about how many paper communications did he send to others?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what about works that were published?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "when was he born?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what about his mom?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "when did she die?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how old was he when she died?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "did he insist he had different parentage?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what was something for which he advocated?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what church did he criticize in his writings?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "did he want them to be involved in government?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what was the nickname his family gave him?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "who was his godmother?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who was she married to?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "where did he go to school?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "during which years?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "did he only speak one language?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1086, "span_end": 1144, "span_text": "whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 22, "span_text": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet ", "input_text": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 86, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "Voltaire", "input_text": "Voltaire", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 353, "span_end": 368, "span_text": "prolific writer", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 513, "span_end": 519, "span_text": "20,000", "input_text": "20,000", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 541, "span_end": 547, "span_text": " 2,000", "input_text": "2,000", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 24, "span_end": 41, "span_text": " 21 November 1694", "input_text": "21 November 1694", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1064, "span_end": 1068, "span_text": "1660", "input_text": "1660", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1071, "span_end": 1083, "span_text": "13 July 1701", "input_text": "13 July 1701", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1064, "span_end": 1083, "span_text": "1660 \u2013 13 July 1701", "input_text": "About 40", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1198, "span_end": 1323, "span_text": " because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Gu\u00e9rin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 600, "span_end": 616, "span_text": " civil liberties", "input_text": "civil liberties", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 208, "span_end": 224, "span_text": " Catholic Church", "input_text": "Catholic Church", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 290, "span_end": 320, "span_text": "separation of church and state", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1518, "span_end": 1523, "span_text": "'Zozo", "input_text": "'Zozo", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1594, "span_end": 1607, "span_text": "Marie Daumard", "input_text": "Marie Daumard", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1620, "span_end": 1640, "span_text": " his mother's cousin", "input_text": "his mother's cousin", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1704, "span_end": 1726, "span_text": "Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand", "input_text": "Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1728, "span_end": 1737, "span_text": "1704\u20131711", "input_text": "1704\u20131711", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1825, "span_end": 1854, "span_text": "Italian, Spanish, and English", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Voltaire.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "37xitheisw95z8hh4d6i4n863cmcr3", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/John Morley___The Life of William Ewart Gladstone (Vol 2 of 3).txt/Chapter I_21a2b318960bdbc980176c22f7a384fa0103ca49cfbbf85d02457bf", "story": "Chapter I.

The whole cabinet was assembled. We resolved after full discussion of pros and cons, and some slight difference of opinion, to resign at once. After which came the startling announcement that Gladstone would no longer retain the leadership of the liberal party, nor resume it, unless the party had settled its differences. He will not expose himself to the insults and outrages of 1866-8, and he has a keen sense of the disloyalty of the party during the last three years. He will sit as a private member and occasionally speak for himself, but he will not attend the House regularly, nor assume any one of the functions of leader. He does this not from anger, but because he says that it is absolutely necessary to party action to learn that all the duties and responsibilities do not rest on the leaders, but that followers have their obligations too. As a consequence of this Cardwell retires to the House of Lords. He will not take the leadership, nor will he consent to serve under any one but Gladstone. He is too old, he says. Lowe protests against the anarchical experiment, and talks of Hartington as leader. As neither Lowe, nor Bright, nor Goschen, nor Forster is in a position to act as leader, it may come to this, so that the liberal front benches of the two Houses will be entirely remodelled.(309) ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What were they a member of?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did they write?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "To whom?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was it about?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was it dated?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was the entire cabinet gathered together?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was the full discussion about?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who would not be the head of the liberal party any longer?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How long had he had a sense of disloyality?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did Lowe protest against?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who do they talk about becoming the leader?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 289, "span_end": 329, "span_text": "A member of the great government of 1868", "input_text": "the great government of 1868", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 289, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "A member of the great government of 1868, in a letter to one of his family", "input_text": "a letter", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 289, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "A member of the great government of 1868, in a letter to one of his family", "input_text": "one of his family", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 289, "span_end": 416, "span_text": "A member of the great government of 1868, in a letter to one of his family, gave an account of the final meeting of the cabinet", "input_text": "an account of the final meeting of the cabinet", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 422, "span_end": 435, "span_text": "Feb. 17, 1874", "input_text": "Feb. 17, 1874", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 516, "span_end": 547, "span_text": "The whole cabinet was assembled", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 549, "span_end": 657, "span_text": "We resolved after full discussion of pros and cons, and some slight difference of opinion, to resign at once", "input_text": "to resign", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 707, "span_end": 776, "span_text": " Gladstone would no longer retain the leadership of the liberal party", "input_text": "Gladstone", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 908, "span_end": 987, "span_text": " he has a keen sense of the disloyalty of the party during the last three years", "input_text": "the last three years", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1597, "span_text": " Lowe protests against the anarchical experiment", "input_text": "the anarchical experiment", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1602, "span_end": 1632, "span_text": " talks of Hartington as leader", "input_text": "Hartington", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "data/gutenberg/txt/John Morley___The Life of William Ewart Gladstone (Vol 2 of 3).txt/Chapter I_21a2b318960bdbc980176c22f7a384fa0103ca49cfbbf85d02457bf"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3ix2egzr7bjs7mnne5n4rrl1tvzjrq", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Stratemeyer___The Rover Boys in the Air.txt/CHAPTER IX_f68207ff3135b2e11ec2f4c92f26627c40c675cf425e90ab138a24f", "story": "CHAPTER IX \n\nTHE NEW ARRIVAL \n\n\"Say, that's great!\" \n\n\"Be careful, Dick!

Now, even not on the top, he is still among the list of the world's wealthiest people.Gates entered Harvard in the fall of 1973. Two years later, he dropped out to found Microsoft with friend Paul Allen. And in 2007, he finally received an honorary doctorate from Harvard. 2. Steve Jobs The iPad, even Buzz Lightyear probably wouldn't have existed if Steve Jobs stayed in school. Because his family couldn't afford his college education, Jobs had to drop out of Reed College just after entering for 6 months. Then he found Apple, NeXT Computer and Pixar, which had made great influences on development of modern technique and culture. However, this wizard thought that his brief college education was not worthless. 3. Frank Lloyd Wright As the America's most celebrated architect, Wright spent more time on designing colleges rather than attending classes in them. Once spent one year in the University of Wisconsin-Madison, then he left for Chicago and started to learn from Louis Sullivan, the \"father of modernism.\" Wright' s splendid resume included more than 500 works, most famous of which are Fallingwater and New York City's Solomon R.

The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \"master designer.\" \n\nBorn in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. \n\nDuring his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative director for the entire company. In this position Ford had artistic control over all of the company's products, as well as its advertising and the design of its stores. Under Ford's direction, Gucci's reputation for cutting-edge style soon returned, and the company began to recover. The style shows starting in 1994 were wildly successful. People loved the low-cut velvet pants, unbuttoned silk shirts, and shiny boots in metallic color1s. By 1999 Gucci, which had almost gone out of business, was worth over $4 billion. \n\nWhen Gucci bought Yves Saint Laurent , Ford became creative director for that fashion house while continuing to design for Gucci. When asked how he would be able to keep the two styles apart, Ford said it wasn't a problem and offered a comparison. Yves Saint Laurent was like Catherine Deneuve, he said while Gucci was more like Sophia Loren. Both are sexy and beautiful women, but with very different styles. \n\nFord left Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in 2004 to form his own company called simply \"Tom Ford\". Not long after, he was working together with cosmetics producer Estee Lauder to bring out new beauty products, and then developed and sold a perfume under his own name. His plans for the future? Ford says that someday he'd definitely like to make a film. He puts it his way: \"That is the main design project. You don't just get to design what people wear, but you design the whole world and whether characters get to live or die. There is what fashion lacks.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What designer came into fashion after the revolution?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did the revolution cause other design houses to do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where was Tom Ford born?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Raised?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What city did he relocate to after graduating?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did he study?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did he train for?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he work as?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did he originally want to design?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was his first job in clothing design?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And then?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "With who?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What huge change did he make?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "With who?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When did he start his own company?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "The revolution was over by the time Tom Ford started working in the fashion world", "input_text": "Tom Ford", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 292, "span_end": 418, "span_text": "To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories", "input_text": "start selling more reasonably priced clothes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 292, "span_end": 379, "span_text": "To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing", "input_text": "To stay in business", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 709, "span_end": 767, "span_text": "Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford", "input_text": "Texas", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 726, "span_end": 761, "span_text": " growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico", "input_text": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 806, "span_end": 861, "span_text": "Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York", "input_text": "New York", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 863, "span_end": 891, "span_text": "where he studied art history", "input_text": "art history", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 893, "span_end": 912, "span_text": "trained as an actor", "input_text": "to be an actor", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 917, "span_end": 935, "span_text": " worked as a model", "input_text": "a model", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 953, "span_end": 994, "span_text": "Ford completed a program in indoor design", "input_text": "indoors of houses", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1089, "span_end": 1182, "span_text": "He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer", "input_text": "a fashion designer", "turn_id": 11, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1089, "span_end": 1182, "span_text": "He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer", "input_text": "Cathy Hardwick i", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1184, "span_end": 1286, "span_text": "His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director.

His capture is particularly important because Moreno is allegedly tied to the Sinaloa Cartel led by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" (Shorty) Guzman, Mexico's most wanted man. \n\nGuzman, who remains a fugitive, commands such a vast international drug trafficking network and his profits from the illicit trade are so big that he made Forbes Magazine's list of the world's most powerful.

It is often ranked as one of the world's most prestigious universities. \n\nFounded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. \n\nThe Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, but more recently in biology, economics, linguistics and management as well.

Well, it's a great event for children. It is great for them to sing on a big stage with thousands of other children. Everyone waits for the parents to arrive in the evening to watch the children put on a great show. There is so much fun. When the lights turn on, everyone sings together at the same time as one.

Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications such as \"Judge\", where he had worked, or \"Life\". Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951.

Then, with an unfriendly smile on his face, the boy took hold of his right leg and mimicked the way Amy limped when she walked. \n\nAmy closed her eyes for a moment. --Ignore him, she told herself as she headed for her classroom. \n\nBut at the end of the day, Amy was still thinking about the tall boy's mean teasing. It wasn't as if he were the only one. Amy was tired of it. Sometimes, even in a classroom full of other students, the teasing about her speech or her limping made her feel all alone. \n\nBack home at the dinner table that evening Amy was quiet. That's why Patti Hagdorn was happy to havesome exciting news to share with her daughter. \n\n\"There's a Christmas Wish Contest on the radio station,\" she announced. \"Write a letter to Santa and you might win a prize. I think someone at this table with blond curly hair should enter.\" \n\nAmy giggled. The contest sounded like fun. She started thinking about what she wanted most for Christmas. \n\nA smile took hold of Amy when the idea first came to her. Out came pencil and paper and Amy went to work on her letter. --Dear Santa Claus, she began. \n\nWhile Amy worked away at her best printing, the rest of the family tried to guess what she might ask from Santa. Amy's sister, Jamie, and Amy's mom both thought a 3-foot Barbie Doll would top Amy's wish list. Amy's dad guessed a picture book. But Amy wasn't ready to reveal her secret Christmas wish just then. Here is Amy's letter to Santa, just as she wrote it that night: \n\nDear Santa Clause, \n\nMy name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy . I just want one day where no one laughs at me or makes fun of me. \n\nLove, \n\nAmy \n\nAt radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. The workers had fun reading about all the different presents that boys and girls from across the city wanted for Christmas. \n\nWhen Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully. He knew cerebral palsy was a muscle disorder that might confuse the schoolmates of Amy who didn't understand her disability. He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper. \n\nThe next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the News Sentinel. The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television station reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable Christmas gift - just one day without teasing. \n\nSuddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement. \n\nDuring that unforgettable Christmas season, over two thousand people from all over the world sent Amy letters of friendship and support. Amy and her family read every single one. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Many people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other. She realized that no amount or form of teasing could ever make her feel lonely again. \n\nAmy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at South Wayne Elementary School. Additionally, everyone at school got an added bonus. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel. \n\nThat year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city.

It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. Armenian is written using the Armenian alphabet, introduced in 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots. \n\nArmenian has developed since the separation from Indo-European mother tongue in the third millennium BCE to at least the time of the first Armenian dynasty (the Yervanduni dynasty, founded in the 6th century BCE). Hellenistic influences during the Artashesian Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 1st century CE) led to word borrowings from Greek and Latin. As the state language of the Arshakuni dynasty of Armenia (1st to 5th century CE) was Parthian, a large portion of Armenian vocabulary has been formed from Parthian borrowings. The earliest extant form of written Armenian is from the 5th century and is known as Classical Armenian (5th to 11th century); translations of the Bible and other religious texts during this period led to extensive word borrowings from Hebrew and Syriac. Middle Armenian (12th to 15th century) began with the establishment of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in the 12th century and is marked by an increased influence of European languages on Armenian, particularly Old French (which had become the secondary language of the Cilician nobility) and Italian (which had become the secondary language of Cilician commerce). Middle Armenian is the first written form of Armenian to display Western-type voicing qualities. Early Modern Armenian (16th to 18th centuries) is a mix of Middle Armenian and an evolving, non-standardized literary Modern Armenian (in Constantinople, Venice, the Ararat plain, and the Persian Armenian communities, particularly New Julfa).

Under the Samanids, Bukhara rivaled Baghdad as a cultural capital of the Islamic world. \n\nThe study of the Quran and the Hadith thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, Fiqh and theology (kalaam) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. Aruzi Samarqandi describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).", "questions": [{"input_text": "What field of science is Al-Biruni know for?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What field is Nasr Iraqi known for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who is a respected philosopher that is known to have met with Avicenna?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is a great physician that is known to have met with Avicenna?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What dynasty was in in the eastern part of Persia, Greater Khorasan and Central Asia?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What dynasty was in the western part of Persia and Iraq?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was one important cultural center of the Islamic world during the Islamic Golden Age?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was another?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was the Quran studied during the Islamic Golden Age?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How about the Hadith?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1364, "span_end": 1410, "span_text": " Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer)", "input_text": "astronomy", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1413, "span_end": 1452, "span_text": "bu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician", "input_text": "mathematics", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1455, "span_end": 1495, "span_text": "Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher", "input_text": "Abu Sahl Masihi", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1501, "span_end": 1542, "span_text": "Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).", "input_text": "Abu al-Khayr Khammar", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 476, "span_end": 525, "span_text": "he Samanid dynasty in the eastern part of Persia,", "input_text": "Samanid", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 575, "span_end": 628, "span_text": "Buyid dynasty in the western part of Persia and Iraq ", "input_text": "Buyid", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 719, "span_end": 764, "span_text": "Bukhara rivaled Baghdad as a cultural capital", "input_text": "Bukhara", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 719, "span_end": 764, "span_text": "Bukhara rivaled Baghdad as a cultural capital", "input_text": "Baghdad", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 866, "span_text": "The study of the Quran and the Hadith thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 854, "span_text": "The study of the Quran and the Hadith thrived in such a scholarly", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "AvicennaAvicenna_82f7a8ee89ce0928eb2f20c3ee833ce9474a0bb23b938d6500f513ea"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3lbxntkx0rvny6wq1s2jrftmxuo9x6", "filename": "middle7680.txt", "story": "This is the true story of a great woman.

They are rarely over five feet six, or 120 pounds. The lighter the weight on the horse, the faster it can go. \n\nRiding fast horses on the track is tough on the small jockeys. The jockey doesn't\"sit\"on the horse. He leans forward on his legs. The strain is on his thighs and calf muscles. As jockeys age, their legs\"go\"first. Jockeys also need arm strength. It's a strain holding a 1000-pound racehorse. \n\nOn muddy days, jockeys get a pounding of mud. The mud comes flying off the hooves of the horses in front. \"It feels like someone is punching you all over,\"says one rider. \n\nAnd a jockey can be hurt. A jockey can have a leg jammed between two horses. Or it can get caught between horse and the rail. The worst accidents are from falls. A horse may fall on his rider. Or horses behind may trample if he hits the track. In one year about 240 riders are hurt badly. That's one out of six jockeys. \n\nBut the jockeys are well-paid. A jockey keeps about ten percent of the money his horses win. Jacinto Vasquez, a five-foot-three comer, has ridden horses to $7,000,000 in wins in the last eight years, which means he does almost $100,000 a year. \n\nWhy do some jockeys do better than others? \"It isn't the way a boy sits on a horse or uses the reins or the whip,\"says Conn McCreary. McCreary was a top jockey of the 1950's. He rode two Kentucky Derby winners. \"Most jockeys do this the same. It's the 'feel' he has for the horses.\" \n\n\"When you come right down to it, it just seems that horses run better for some riders,\" McCreary says. \"A real good jockey doesn't lose with the best horse. And sometimes he'll win with the second or third best.\" \n\nMany Latin-American riders, like Jacinto, seem to have the _ . \"Maybe it's because we grew up with horses,\"says Jacinto. \"Maybe it's because we like to ride. There was a strike at Aqueduct last year. We, Jorge Velasquez, and Angel Cordero (two other top Latin riders) went to a park.

Every year, Tara Atkins-Smith collects warm clothes from her community in order to help the less lucky. This year, since the family was traveling to Halifax with their daughter Jayda and seven of her friends to celebrate her 8thbirthday Tara thought it was the perfect time to teach the chidren a valuable life lesson. The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles for others to pick up. Each of the clothes had a tag that read, \"I am not lost. If you are caught in the cold, please take me to keep warm. \" According to Tara, the experience helped the children better understand the difficult situation of homeless people, who have to brave the cold winter on the streets. \"When we got back in the car after an hour on the street, they were all freezing cold and crying for the heater to be on because they were cold , \" she said. By next morning, all the jackets, gloves, and scarves on the poles were gone. Photos of the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook, and have got over10,000 likes.

It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history. In the first centuries AD, the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region, followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137. During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia was the only territory in Africa to defeat a European colonial power and retain its sovereignty. Many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours. Ethiopia was also the first independent member from Africa of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, the Ethiopian monarchy under Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg, a communist military government backed by the Soviet Union. In 1987, the Derg established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, but it was overthrown in 1991 by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which has been the ruling political coalition since.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is this about ?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "is some of the oldest traces of humans from there ?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "it traced roots as far back as when ?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "ad or bc ?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "did it have a democrat  government ?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what kind was it ?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what happened in 1991 ?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "by who ?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "is it still ruling ?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "when was it 1st overthrown ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "under who ?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "by the what ?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "whats the population ?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "and the 2nd most what ?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what it the capital ?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "it that the smallest city ?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "how many borders does it share ?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what it to the north ?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what maintained a unified civilization ?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "when ?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 8, "span_text": "Ethiopia", "input_text": "Ethiopia", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 594, "span_end": 655, "span_text": "Some of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern humans ha", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 950, "span_end": 964, "span_text": "2nd millennium", "input_text": "2nd millennium", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 965, "span_end": 967, "span_text": "BC", "input_text": "BC", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1006, "span_end": 1015, "span_text": "monarchy ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1006, "span_end": 1014, "span_text": "monarchy", "input_text": "monarchy", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1767, "span_end": 1784, "span_text": "it was overthrown", "input_text": "it was overthrown", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1800, "span_end": 1849, "span_text": "Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front", "input_text": "Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1870, "span_end": 1903, "span_text": "ruling political coalition since.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1553, "span_text": "1974", "input_text": "1974", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1584, "span_end": 1599, "span_text": "Haile Selassie ", "input_text": "Haile Selassie", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1621, "span_end": 1625, "span_text": "Derg", "input_text": "Derg", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 356, "span_end": 367, "span_text": "100 million", "input_text": "100 million", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 471, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "populous nation", "input_text": "populous nation", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 579, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "Addis Ababa", "input_text": "Addis Ababa", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 563, "span_end": 575, "span_text": "largest city", "input_text": "largest city", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 193, "span_end": 345, "span_text": " It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south.", "input_text": "Six", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 217, "span_end": 224, "span_text": "Eritrea", "input_text": "Eritrea", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1071, "span_end": 1087, "span_text": "Kingdom of Aksum", "input_text": "Kingdom of Aksum", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1046, "span_end": 1065, "span_text": " first centuries AD", "input_text": "first centuries AD", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Ethiopia.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3oxv7eaxleqo0pnejwsj0pdg0yj63w", "filename": "middle7153.txt", "story": "Presents For Children's Day Charles M.

Why do your teachers use songs to teach you English? It seems there is a scientific reason for this. Researchers are now studying the relationship between music and remembering a foreign language. They find that remembering words in a song is the best way to remember even the most difficult language. \"Singing could be a new way of learning a foreign language. The brain likes to remember things when they are used in a _ and meaningful way\", said Dr, Karen Ludke. The findings may help those who have difficulties learning foreign languages. On his blog, Dr. Ludke writes, \"A listen-and-repeat singing method can support foreign language learning, and opens the door for future research in this area.\" Many language teachers know the value of using music and singing. Hua Zhuying, a teacher at a Chinese language school in Washington, D.C. depends heavily on songs in teaching Chinese. She says, \"I use music all the time to teach children Chinese. For little kids usually we use the music. Not only does it work, but it is fun for kids.\" \"Sometimes, I think if I were taught English that way, maybe I could speak much better English than now,\" Hua Zhuying adds.

The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced.

If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . \"Everyone should just relax\", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents.\" Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway.

Eduardo started up the stairs, but thick, black smoke, swirling ash, and extreme heatforced him to his knees. He inched upstairs and down the hall where Alex said he would find Cody, eight, who had locked himself in a bedroom. \"I'd never seen smoke like that,\" says Eduardo. \"My glasses immediately turned black from the ash.\" As the fire spread across the hall, Eduardo banged on the bedroom door and tried to turn the handle. But Cody didn't respond, and Eduardo made his way back downstairs. At the same time, Marcos saw Yim and Suzanne pulling an aluminum ladder out of the garage. \"Cody was standing at the window, screaming for help,\" says Marcos. \"I knew I had to do something.\" He grabbed the ladder, positioned it near the window, and climbed towards the boy. When Marcos reached the window, he pushed the screen into the room and persuaded Cody out. \"It's OK,\" Marcos told him. \"I've got you.\" Holding Cody with one arm, Marcos moved down the ladder. Halfway down, he handed the boy to a neighbor. The day after the fire, Alex visited Marcos. \"Thank you for saving my son,\" Alex said. \"You are his hero forever.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What profession is Marco's father in?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was Marcos wearing on his feel when he ran outside?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was he wearing?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was the teacher doing when Marcos caught his attention?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was burning?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Whose house?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many of the Ma's were waiting outside for help?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who was still inside?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And where was he?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 87, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "teacher", "input_text": "teacher", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 380, "span_end": 397, "span_text": "the barefoot teen", "input_text": "nothing", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 356, "span_end": 378, "span_text": "Dressed only in shorts", "input_text": "shorts", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 96, "span_end": 117, "span_text": "prepared lesson plans", "input_text": "preparing lesson plans", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 314, "span_end": 340, "span_text": "Dad, the house is on fire!", "input_text": "house", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 310, "span_text": "neighbors' house", "input_text": "neighbors' house", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 441, "span_end": 534, "span_text": "Grandmother Yim Ma, mother Suzanne Ma, and son Nathan Ma were gathered on the front grassland", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 623, "span_end": 666, "span_text": " father Alex Ma was falling down the stairs", "input_text": "Alex Ma", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 704, "span_end": 759, "span_text": "\"Is anyone else in the house?\" Eduardo asked. \"My son!\"", "input_text": "His son", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 988, "span_end": 999, "span_text": "Cody, eight", "input_text": "eight", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1396, "span_end": 1429, "span_text": " \"Cody was standing at the window", "input_text": "window", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high14943.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3p1l2b7ad1pv5zj7pyiddbtomqelo1", "filename": "high21353.txt", "story": "Which is sillier: denying we ever went to the moon or trying to convince the true nonbelievers? \n\nOnce upon a time - July 20, 1969, to be specific - two men got out of their little spaceship and wandered around on the moon for a while.Ten more men walked on the moon over the next three and a half years. \n\nUnfortunately, not quite.A fair number of Americans think that this whole business of moon landings really isa fairy tale.They believe that the landings were a big hoax staged in the Mojave Desert, to convince everyone that U.S.technology was the \"best\" in the whole wide world. \n\nWhich is the harder thing to do: Send men to the moon or make believe we did?

The territory was subsequently ceded to Great Britain \"in perpetuity\" under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, which is only eight miles (13\u00a0km) wide at this naval \"choke point\" and remains strategically important to this day with half the world's seaborne trade passing through the strait. Today Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and cargo ship refuelling services. \n\nThe sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations as Spain asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and again in 2002.

McHenry specifically cites a 2005 Wall Street Journal survey of scholars who placed Reagan at No. 6 and Grant at No. 29. \n\n\"Every generation needs its own heroes,\" McHenry also said. \"One decade into the 21st century, it's time to honor the last great president of the 20th and give President Reagan a place beside Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy.\" \n\nFranklin Roosevelt's face currently appears on the dime while John F.

Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated $ 500,000 to the project.

corruption charges in his home state of Chiapas, officials said. \n\nMariano Francisco Herran Salvatti, who also was the attorney general in Chiapas for more than six years, is charged with embezzlement, criminal association and other acts of corruption, Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar said. \n\n\"In Chiapas, the validity of the law also means that the culture of privilege has passed and justice is applied equally to all,\" Lopez said on the Chiapas government Web page. \n\nHerran was arrested Saturday night in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, but Lopez did not announce the arrest until Sunday. \n\nThe attorney general contends Herran committed the crimes while he served as secretary of economic development in Chiapas, a post he held from November 2007 until June. \n\nOfficials are investigating irregularities involving 175 million pesos (about $12.5 million), Notimex said. \n\nHerran served as drug czar for President Ernesto Zedillo from 1997 to 2000. In that post, he was involved in the prosecution of more than 60 members of the Juarez drug cartel and the investigation that led to the 2001 arrest of former Quintana Roo Gov.

But it wasn't a dream. Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep. Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \"sleep texting\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting.
