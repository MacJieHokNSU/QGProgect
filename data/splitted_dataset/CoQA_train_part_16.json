JAMES III. \n\nJames II. left three sons; the eldest, James III., aged nine, was crowned at Kelso (August 10, 1460); his brothers, bearing the titles of Albany and Mar, were not to be his supports. His mother, Mary of Gueldres, had the charge of the boys, and, as she was won over by her uncle, Philip of Burgundy, to the cause of the House of York, while Kennedy and the Earl of Angus stood for the House of Lancaster, there was strife between them and the queen-mother and nobles. Kennedy relied on France (Louis XL), and his opponents on England. \n\nThe battle of Towton (March 30, 1461) drove Henry VI. and his queen across the Border, where Kennedy entertained the melancholy exile in the Castle of St Andrews. The grateful Henry restored Berwick to the Scots, who could not hold it long. In June 1461, while the Scots were failing to take Carlisle, Edward IV. was crowned, and sent his adherent, the exiled Earl of Douglas, to treat for an alliance with the Celts, under John, Lord of the Isles, and that Donald Balloch who was falsely believed to have long before been slain in Ireland. \n\nIt is curious to think of the Lord of the Isles dealing as an independent prince, through a renegade Douglas, with the English king. A treaty was made at John's Castle of Ardtornish--now a shell of crumbling stone on the sea-shore of the Morvern side of the Sound of Mull--with the English monarch at Westminster. The Highland chiefs promise allegiance to Edward, and, if successful, the Celts are to recover the ancient kingdom from Caithness to the Forth, while Douglas is to be all-powerful from the Forth to the Border!

St. John's was incorporated as a city in 1888, yet is considered by some to be the oldest English-founded city in North America. It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland. With a population of 214,285 as of July 1, 2015, the St. John's Metropolitan Area is the second largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada after Halifax and the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada. It is one of the world's top ten oceanside destinations, according to National Geographic Magazine. Its name has been attributed to the feast day of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497, and also to a Basque fishing town with the same name. \n\nSt. John's is one of the oldest settlements in North America, with year-round settlement beginning sometime after 1630 and seasonal habitation long before that. It is not, however, the oldest surviving English settlement in North America or Canada, having been preceded by the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids, founded in 1610, and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace, founded in 1618. In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest. Other permanent English settlements in the Americas that predate St. John's include: St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and Jamestown, Virginia (1607).", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which is the largest Newfoundland city?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "In what other part of Canada is it also the largest city?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was it incorporated?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was its population in 2015?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's its size ranking in the Census Metropolitan Area?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What's the ranking in the Canadian metro area in size?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's its name attributed to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "In what continent is it located?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When did Cabot arrive?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When did seasonal camps in Newfoundland beging?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who founded it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Aside from largest city, what else is it to Labrador?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And where else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is CMA stand for?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 99, "span_text": "St. John's (/\u02ccse\u026ant\u02c8d\u0292\u0252nz/, local /\u02ccse\u026ant\u02c8d\u0292\u0251\u02d0nz/) is the capital and largest city in Newfoundland ", "input_text": "St. John's", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 103, "span_end": 120, "span_text": "Labrador, Canada.", "input_text": "Labrador", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 136, "span_end": 166, "span_text": "incorporated as a city in 1888", "input_text": "1888", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 338, "span_end": 385, "span_text": "With a population of 214,285 as of July 1, 2015", "input_text": "214,285", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 514, "span_end": 554, "span_text": "20th largest metropolitan area in Canada", "input_text": "20th", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 514, "span_end": 545, "span_text": "20th largest metropolitan area ", "input_text": "20th", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 692, "span_end": 721, "span_text": "feast day of John the Baptist", "input_text": "feast day of John the Baptist", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1073, "span_end": 1087, "span_text": "North America ", "input_text": "North America", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 734, "span_end": 791, "span_text": "abot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497", "input_text": "1497", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 938, "span_end": 1010, "span_text": "beginning sometime after 1630 and seasonal habitation long before that.

Best known for his CNN, Ted Turner launched a second nationwide all-news network, Headline News, purchased the Atlanta Braves baseball team, and became the world's best yachtsman at the America's Cup in 1977. In 1982 Ted Turner was named by Forbes one of the 400 richest people in the US. He was named Time magazine's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992. How did Ted Turner accomplish all of this at such a young age? \n\nTed Turner's father, Ed, was a self-made millionaire who demanded that his only son try to achieve similar success. He instilled in the boy a strong belief that hard work was good. Besides reading a new book every two days, Ted Turner was also charged rent at home during summer vacations from boarding school. Ed Turner was a strong influence in his son's life. \n\nAs a child, Ted Turner lived a very lonely life, often separated from his family. During World War II, his father served in the Navy. Ed Turner took his wife and daughter with him so they could live nearby but left his 6yearold son behind in a boarding school in Cincinnati, Ohio. When Ted Turner was in the fifth grade, his father enrolled him in a military academy. Even though Turner had friends at school, it didn't make up for the absence of his parents and sister. Eventually Ted Turner enrolled at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended college off and on, became involved in sailboat racing, and became a member of the U.S. Coast Guard for a while. In his early twenties, he became general manager of one of his father's branch offices -- the Turner Advertising Company in Macon, Georgia. \n\nTwo years later after his father's suicide, Ted Turner took over the company. He soon discovered that he was more skilled than his father in managing the business. During the next twenty years, Ted Turner worked hard to accumulate enough power and money to fulfill his father's dream. \n\nReflecting on his father's death, however, Ted Turner realized that it was dangerous to put too much emphasis on material possessions. He decided to use his hard-earned influence to serve the public. Concerned about the environment, Ted Turner established the Better World Society in 1985. The purpose of this organization was to produce documentaries to educate people about pollution, hunger, and the danger of building weapons of mass destruction.

On 3rd March 2016 children of all ages in the UK will come together to appreciate reading. Sometimes, reading a modern novel can be tough ( Booker Prize winner The Luminaries runs to 832 pages! ), especially if reading is not your strong suit. In fact, one in six people in the UK never pick up a book because they've experienced difficulties or are out of the habit of reading for pleasure. \n\nThe Galaxy Quick Reads series are designed to introduce reluctant readers to bestselling short funny novels, which bring the joy of reading without demanding hours of concentrated time. They cover a range of subjects, from romance to comedy. \n\nJojo Moyes's Paris For One is a romantic adventure in which 26-year-old Nell books a weekend away to Paris with her lazy, neglectful boyfriend. When he fails to turn up, she is alone in the city. That is, until she meets Fabien, who shows her the charms of the French capital -- in more ways than one. \n\nAdele Geras's moving story Out In The Dark was set in World War I, in which young Rob came back from the battlefields. Determined to find the officer's widow to return the photo of her and their daughter that the captain kept with him, he traveled several thousand miles but never gave up. \n\nDead Man Talking is a fantastic tale of Pat, who had a terrible fight with his best friend, Joe, ten years ago -- but now hears that Joe is dead, and he must attend his funeral. But Joe is not going quietly that very night -- he's lying in his coffin being very chatty indeed.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When is World Book Day celebrated in the UK?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What book series is for people who don't like to read?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is so special about that series?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What subjects do they offer?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Why does Nell's boyfriend not arrive in Paris?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does she do about that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does she do with Fabien?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where is Adele Geras's story set?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who was Rob looking for?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why was he looking for her?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What happened to Pat?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What happened to his buddy?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What spooky thing is happening during the funeral?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 192, "span_end": 223, "span_text": "is a yearly event on 23rd April", "input_text": "on 23rd April", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 811, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "The Galaxy Quick Reads series", "input_text": "The Galaxy Quick Reads series", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 834, "span_end": 918, "span_text": "series are designed to introduce reluctant readers to bestselling short funny novels", "input_text": "its designed to introduce reluctant readers to bestselling short funny novels", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 996, "span_end": 1053, "span_text": " They cover a range of subjects, from romance to comedy.

She was not sure what gave her the idea, but she wanted to look like a movie star. \"I have a lot of pictures from my childhood of me wearing sunglasses,\" she says. \"I used to wear them to watch TV.\" Early movie actors started wearing sunglasses, not because they looked good, but because their eyes hurt. The lights used on movie sets were really bright and could cause a painful problem known as \"Klieg eyes\". It was named after the Klieg brothers who invented the lights. Actors wore sunglasses to give their eyes a rest. But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must. From then on, actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hepburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. \n\nRecently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. \n\nBy the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. \n\nApproaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\" a swimming official told her team, \"or you will be disqualified.\" \n\nEverybody on her team started screaming, \"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \"You have to put the sock on,\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. \n\nBy now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. \n\nOn the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal.

resumed debate Wednesday on a bill that may result in the region's first statutory minimum wage. \n\nThe Minimum Wage Bill is a controversial piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will protect the most vulnerable workers in Hong Kong, one of the few places in the world without any sort of minimum wage law. \n\nThe debate is set to take two to three days. \n\nA recent government survey showed that around half a million workers in Hong Kong earn less than $4 an hour. These include low-skilled workers from the catering, retail, and cleaning industries. \n\nAccording to Man Hon Poon, a policy researcher at the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Union, the lack of legal protection for workers has led to serious exploitation. \n\n\"Workers in restaurants have to work for 12 hours or even 14 hours a day to earn a living,\" he said. \"They cannot even go to the cinema.\" \n\nLegislator Tommy Cheung, however, claims that the government should not interfere with the free market economy, which he says has served Hong Kong well in the past. A minimum wage could deter investors and lead to increased unemployment, said Cheung, who represents the catering industry. \n\n\"There is one fear within the industry, that they would have to close down,\" he said. \"When you see a closure, everyone loses out.\" \n\nThe government first proposed the current bill in 2008 following a failed attempt at a voluntary minimum wage. Labor unions, however, have been lobbying for a minimum wage since 1998, following the Asian financial crisis.

The Secretary-General serves as the chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations Secretariat, and of the Secretary-General in particular, is laid out by Chapter\u00a0XV (Articles\u00a097 to 101) of the United Nations Charter. \n\nAs of 2017, the Secretary-General is Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, appointed by the General Assembly on 13 October 2016. \n\nThe Secretary-General was envisioned by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a \"world moderator\", but the vague definition provided by the UN Charter left much room for interpretation by those who would later occupy the position. According to the UN website, their roles are further defined as \"diplomat and advocate, civil servant, and CEO\". Nevertheless, this more abstract description has not prevented the office holders from speaking out and playing important roles on global issues to various degrees. Article\u00a097 under of the United Nations Charter states that the Secretary-General shall be the \"chief administrative officer\" of the Organization, but does not dictate their specific obligations. \n\nResponsibilities of the Secretary-General are further outlined in Articles\u00a098 through 100. Article\u00a098 states that they shall act as the chief administrative officer \"in all meetings of the General Assembly, of the Security Council, of the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council, and shall perform other functions as are entrusted to him by these organs\". They are also responsible for making an annual report to the General Assembly.

Comprising the Shetland constituency of the Scottish Parliament, Shetland Islands Council is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland; the islands' administrative centre and only burgh is Lerwick, which has also been the capital of Shetland since taking over from Scalloway in 1708. \n\nThe largest island, known as the \"Mainland\", has an area of , making it the third-largest Scottish island and the fifth-largest of the British Isles. There are an additional 15 inhabited islands. The archipelago has an oceanic climate, a complex geology, a rugged coastline and many low, rolling hills. \n\nHumans have lived in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The earliest written references to the islands date back to Roman times.

It contains a large amount of information about the biological function of proteins derived from the research literature. \n\nThe UniProt consortium comprises the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). EBI, located at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK, hosts a large resource of bioinformatics databases and services. SIB, located in Geneva, Switzerland, maintains the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) servers that are a central resource for proteomics tools and databases. PIR, hosted by the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, DC, USA, is heir to the oldest protein sequence database, Margaret Dayhoff's Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, first published in 1965. In 2002, EBI, SIB, and PIR joined forces as the UniProt consortium. \n\nEach consortium member is heavily involved in protein database maintenance and annotation. Until recently, EBI and SIB together produced the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases, while PIR produced the Protein Sequence Database (PIR-PSD). These databases coexisted with differing protein sequence coverage and annotation priorities. \n\nSwiss-Prot was created in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and subsequently developed by Rolf Apweiler at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Swiss-Prot aimed to provide reliable protein sequences associated with a high level of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recognizing that sequence data were being generated at a pace exceeding Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up, TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was created to provide automated annotations for those proteins not in Swiss-Prot. Meanwhile, PIR maintained the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was Swiss-Prot developed?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "By whom?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was he working on a dissertation at the time?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was he working on his PhD?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which entity helped Amos in the development?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did someone later work on its development?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "And his entity?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the use of UniProt?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the NBRF?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "From which institution?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1400, "span_end": 1430, "span_text": "Swiss-Prot was created in 1986", "input_text": "1986", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1400, "span_end": 1446, "span_text": "Swiss-Prot was created in 1986 by Amos Bairoch", "input_text": "Amos Bairoch", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 3, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1434, "span_end": 1461, "span_text": "Amos Bairoch during his PhD", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1400, "span_end": 1516, "span_text": "Swiss-Prot was created in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "input_text": "Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1400, "span_end": 1560, "span_text": "Swiss-Prot was created in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and subsequently developed by Rolf Apweiler", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1400, "span_end": 1560, "span_text": "Swiss-Prot was created in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and subsequently developed by Rolf Apweiler", "input_text": "Rolf Apweiler", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1547, "span_end": 1601, "span_text": "Rolf Apweiler at the European Bioinformatics Institute", "input_text": "European Bioinformatics Institute", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "UniProt is a freely accessible database of protein sequence and functional information", "input_text": "database of protein sequence and functional information", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 746, "span_end": 797, "span_text": " the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF)", "input_text": "National Biomedical Research Foundation", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 791, "span_end": 855, "span_text": "(NBRF) at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington", "input_text": "Georgetown University Medical Center", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "UniProt.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "35gcefq6i5oqoz7pl1puxn6b6i43z5", "filename": "middle3648.txt", "story": "A large book NBA star Yao Ming's English autography will come out in New York, US , this month.

Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the Earth's oceans.

I belong in that spot. I will do everything I can to get the title.\" \n\nSome would say, too, that Sharapova has fate on her side. \n\nShe was almost knocked out in the second round, needing to save a pair of match points against qualifier Alexandra Panova. And only last year Li Na took advantage of her second chance in Melbourne, fending off a match point in the third round before going on to capture a second grand slam title a week later.

The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing).

Delta flight in February was sentenced Monday to eight months in prison, the man's lawyer said. \n\nJoe Rickey Hundley pleaded guilty to assault in federal court in October. \n\nHundley's attorney,

to the crime and added that it was two months longer than what prosecutors had recommended. \n\nIn February, Hundley was seated next to Jessica Bennett and her 19-month-old son in row 28 when Delta flight 721 from Minneapolis, Minnestoa, began its descent into Atlanta . \n\nWhen the baby began to cry, Hundley allegedly told Bennett to \"shut that (N-word) baby up,\" according to an FBI affidavit. \n\n\"(He) then turned around and slapped (the child) in the face with an open hand, which caused (him) to scream even louder,\" the affidavit continued. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. \n\nShein said in a February statement that her client was in distress and grieving during the flight after learning the day before that his son was in a coma, after overdosing on insulin. \n\nHundley was headed to Atlanta to decide whether or not to take his son -- who died the day after the flight -- off life support. \n\nShein said Hundley \"had paid a terrible price for his hurtful words but asks only that people understand that he was not doing well that night and spoke hurtful words he would have not otherwise have said.\" ", "questions":

These were Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. The youngest sister, Anne, was also a gifted novelist, and her books have the same extraordinary quality as her sisters'. \n\nTheir father was Patrick Bronte, born in Ireland. He moved with his wife, Maria Bronte, and their six small children to Haworth in Yorkshire in 1820. Soon after, Mrs. Bronte and the two eldest children died, leaving the father to care of the remaining three girls and a boy. \n\nCharlotte was born in 1816. Emily was born in 1818 and Anne in 1820. Their brother Branwell was born in 1817. Left to themselves, the children wrote and told stories and walked over the hills. They grew up largely self-educated. Branwell showed a great interest in drawing. The girls were determined to earn money for his art education. They took positions as teachers or taught children in their homes. \n\nAs children they had all written many stories. Charlotte, as a young girl, alone wrote 22 books, each with 60 to 100 pages of small handwriting. Therefore, they turned to writing for income. By 1847, Charlotte had written The Professor; Emily, Wuthering Heights; and Anne, Agnes Grey. After much difficulty Anne and Emily found a publisher , but there was no interest shown in Charlotte's book. (It was not published until 1859.) However, one publisher expressed an interest in seeing more of her works. Jane Eyre was already started, and she hurriedly finished it. It was accepted at once; thus each of the sisters had a book published in 1847. \n\nJane Eyre was immediately successful; the other two, however, did not do so well. People did not like Wuthering Heights. They said it was too wild, too animal-like. But gradually it came to be considered one of the finest novels in the English language. Emily lived only a short while after the publication of the book, and Anne died in 1849. \n\nCharlotte published Shirley in 1849, and Villette in 1853. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls.

The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable news channel. \n\nIn the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. Moves were made to sharpen the channel's news image through a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News.

Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics. \n\nBronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae, and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durr\u00ebs discovered in Durr\u00ebs, Albania in 1916, is an early figural example; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.

She cradles a young dog called Jennifer, the only survivor when a shell hit her family's home near the airport.

More than 70\u00a0million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Suarez's fine strike was tipped onto the post by City's England goalkeeper Joe Hart. \n\nBut the visiting defense was struggling to cope with Liverpool's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when Carroll's superbly struck left-footed strike, from just outside the area, swerved past Hart for his first goal since joining the club for a British record transfer fee in January. \n\nLiverpool doubled their lead in the 34th minute when City failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots, the ball eventually falling to the feet of Dirk Kuyt who fired through the legs of defender Alexander Kolarov and past Hart. \n\nLiverpool made it 3-0 a minute later when Raul Meireles curled in an inviting cross from the left for Carroll to outjump Kolarov and help the ball into the far corner of the net. \n\nLiverpool had chances to increase their lead after the break but Hart did well to keep out efforts from Meireles and Kuyt, while Suarez fired wide from an acute angle and Carroll headed over the crossbar from a good position.

Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals. Larger airports may have fixed base operator services, airport aprons, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. \n\nThe majority of the world's airports are non-towered, with no air traffic control presence. Busy airports have air traffic control (ATC) system. All airports use a traffic pattern to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There are a number of aids available to pilots, though not all airports are equipped with them. Many airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain, snow, or fog.

CNN takes a closer look at the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and how he's becoming more popular with every game. \n\nWho is Jeremy Lin? \n\nBorn to parents Shirley and Gie-Ming on August 23, 1988, Lin is an Asian-American NBA player for the New York Knicks. He wears the jersey No. 17 and plays as point guard. As a professional basketballer he's not overly tall, measuring 6 feet, 3 inches (191 centimeters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). He played for four years at Harvard, and has spent just one year as a professional player. \n\nCareer highlights: \n\nFollowing his stint at Harvard (where he was twice named to the all-Ivy League), Lin failed to get drafted by an NBA franchise, and instead signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors in July, 2010. In December 2011, Lin signed with the New York Knicks after being cut by the Houston Rockets. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. \n\n'Linsanity': Why the hype? \n\nEveryone loves a battle-against-the-odds story, and Lin fits the bill perfectly. The reasons for his meteoric rise to become a U.S. basketball sensation are numerous, but it all starts with talent. In just weeks he's gone from one-time bench-warmer to team savior, leading the Knicks to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game, while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50%. In Friday's game against Kobe Bryant's L.A. Lakers, he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone.

one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the \"Father of Liberalism\". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. \n\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as David Hume, Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of \"consciousness\". He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate or \"tabula rasa\". Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception. This is now known as empiricism. An example of Locke's belief in Empiricism can be seen in his quote, \"whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire.\" This shows the ideology of science in his observations in that something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproven.

In Cleveland, she did work for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Cerebral Palsy Association, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. \n\nShe and her husband started and funded the Hospice of the Western Reserve in Cleveland. \n\nModell was a major contributor in Baltimore to the St. Vincent's Center and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modells contributed $3.5 million to the Lyric Opera House, which was recently renamed the Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric. \n\nThe Modells pledged $5 million to help start a public boarding school, The SEED School, for disadvantaged students.

Supporters of Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann will have to be content with yard signs or donations as ways of cheering on their favorite would-be nominee. \n\nThat's because their campaigns failed to gain the requisite 10,000 signatures. It is, to be sure, a self-inflicted wound, a measure of some organizational chaos. But it is also a function of illogically restrictive local laws. They not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the Oval Office. \n\nThe United States is the only nation in the world, save Switzerland, that does not have uniform federal ballot access laws, according to Ballot Access News, a website run by Richard Winger that is dedicated to the issue. This may reflect the country's closely held federalism, but it can create chaos in a presidential year. In many cases, the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates. \n\nTake, for example, my home state of New York. It votes reliably Democratic in presidential years, at least since Ronald Reagan thrashed Walter Mondale in 1984. But the state's primary delegates can still be a prize in a protracted Republican nomination fight. In 1999, John McCain had to sue to even have his name appear on the ballot alongside George W. Bush because the Republican state party chair and his committee essentially decided that Bush would be their nominee without the inconvenience of putting it to a vote. Local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end-run around democracy. Each presidential cycle, the corrupt kabuki continues.

It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark \u2013 all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as \"Pump Up The Volume\" by MARRS (1987), \"House Nation\" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), \"Theme from S'Express\" by S'Express (1988) and \"Doctorin' the House\" by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide. \n\nEarly house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house and jump house.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where did house music originate?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which three cities did it quickly spread to?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did each of these cities do?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What type of beats was early house music?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What provide most of the rhythms?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What other music was it similar to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is the most important thing in house music?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Name another part of the world where house became popular?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Is there anywhere else?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 65, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "in Chicago in the early 1980s", "input_text": "in Chicago", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 75, "span_end": 94, "span_text": " in the early 1980s", "input_text": "in the 1980s", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 169, "span_end": 243, "span_text": "spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark", "input_text": "Detroit, New York City, and Newark", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 252, "span_end": 294, "span_text": " which developed their own regional scenes", "input_text": "they developed their own regional scenes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 851, "span_end": 888, "span_text": "characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats", "input_text": "they were repetitive 4/4 beats", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 890, "span_end": 930, "span_text": "rhythms mainly provided by drum machines", "input_text": "drum machines", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1013, "span_end": 1052, "span_text": " characteristics similar to disco music", "input_text": "its similar to disco", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1098, "span_end": 1148, "span_text": " the repetitive rhythm of house was more important", "input_text": "the repetitive rhythm was", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 322, "span_end": 358, "span_text": "house music became popular in Europe", "input_text": "it became popular in Europe", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 341, "span_end": 414, "span_text": "popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia", "input_text": "Australia", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 399, "span_text": "as well as major cities in South America", "input_text": "cities in South America", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "House_musicHouse_music_c6a648fcaad97208e4865bde859beb67a5f63ba05a77c2fe33b272fe"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3z9wi9eozzoatcf20lbme2j8ld5kh1", "filename": "cnn_b93abcdf348537647f0d6a72c4bcbd01de6f219c.story", "story": "(CNN) -- Perhaps somebody forgot to tell Rafael Benitez that the Oscars were last week. \n\nIt doesn't matter. Benitez's extraordinary post-match performance Wednesday managed to combine the good, the bad and the ugly as the Chelsea manager launched a scathing attack on his employers and club's supporters before revealing he will quit at the end of this season. \n\nHere was Benitez, the victim.

Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established. It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status. \n\nUntil recently, in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition, the concept was thought to mean (as a shorthand) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government'. New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively. Leading examples of the federal state include the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and India.

It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. \n\nAs a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its indigenous cultures. Beginning as early as 7000 BC, the domestication of cacao, maize, beans, tomato, squash and chili, as well as the turkey and dog, caused a transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex mythological and religious tradition, a vigesimal numeric system, and a complex calendric system, a tradition of ball playing, and a distinct architectural style, were diffused through the area. Also in this period, villages began to become socially stratified and develop into chiefdoms with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as obsidian, jade, cacao, cinnabar, \"Spondylus\" shells, hematite, and ceramics.

Guede, Knox and Sollecito have all denied wrongdoing. Guede's attorney said he will appeal the conviction and sentence. \n\nKercher, a 21-year-old exchange student at the University of Perugia, was found nearly a year ago, dead in her bed, with a knife wound to her neck. Official reports said Kercher may have been sexually assaulted before she died and that she bled to death. \n\nMembers of Kercher's family spoke to reporters following the court proceeding. John Kercher Jr., one of the woman's brothers, said it was \"overwhelming\" to be in the same room as Guede when the judge convicted and sentenced him. \n\nBut Lyle Kercher, a second brother, said that \"pleased\" wasn't the right word for the family's feelings, noting that his sister was murdered. \"Satisfied\" was more appropriate given the circumstances, he said. \n\nAt his lawyers' request, Guede, hoping for a lesser sentence, received a separate fast-track trial from Knox and Sollecito. \n\nLawyers for Sollecito, 24, and Knox, 21, asked that their clients -- who have been in jail since shortly after the murder -- be allowed to stay under house arrest if indicted.

An introductory economics textbook describes econometrics as allowing economists \"to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships\". The first known use of the term \"econometrics\" (in cognate form) was by Polish economist Pawe\u0142 Ciompa in 1910. Jan Tinbergen is considered by many to be one of the founding fathers of econometrics. Ragnar Frisch is credited with coining the term in the sense in which it is used today. \n\nThe basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods. Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. \"Applied econometrics\" uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analyzing economic history, and forecasting. \n\nThe basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis. Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualized as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what method is being discussed?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what does it try to do?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what else is it considered to be?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "based on what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what does it allow economists to do?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "when was the word first used?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who is he?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who made up the term that we now use?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who else played an important role in coming up with it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "to what extent?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what is the most important tool for econometrics?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what does this theory use?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "to accomplish what?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "which is the most used tool?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "how is this done?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "how is it visualized?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "of what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what is the main goal of an econometrician?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 12, "span_text": "Econometrics", "input_text": "Econometrics", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 16, "span_end": 71, "span_text": "the application of statistical methods to economic data", "input_text": "the application of statistical methods to economic data", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 129, "span_end": 173, "span_text": "give empirical content to economic relations", "input_text": "give empirical content to economic relations", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 198, "span_end": 252, "span_text": "the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena", "input_text": "the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 262, "span_end": 359, "span_text": "the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference", "input_text": "the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 446, "span_end": 509, "span_text": " sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships", "input_text": "sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 617, "span_end": 621, "span_text": "1910", "input_text": "1910", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 601, "span_end": 613, "span_text": "Pawe\u0142 Ciompa", "input_text": "Pawe\u0142 Ciompa", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 584, "span_end": 600, "span_text": "Polish economist", "input_text": "a Polish economist", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 710, "span_end": 723, "span_text": "Ragnar Frisch", "input_text": "Ragnar Frisch", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 623, "span_end": 636, "span_text": "Jan Tinbergen", "input_text": "Jan Tinbergen", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 640, "span_end": 692, "span_text": "considered by many to be one of the founding fathers", "input_text": "considered by many to be one of the founding fathers", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 835, "span_end": 871, "span_text": "the multiple linear regression model", "input_text": "the multiple linear regression model", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 897, "span_end": 943, "span_text": "statistical theory and mathematical statistics", "input_text": "statistical theory and mathematical statistics", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 944, "span_end": 987, "span_text": "to evaluate and develop econometric methods", "input_text": "to evaluate and develop econometric methods", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1454, "span_end": 1471, "span_text": "linear regression", "input_text": "linear regression", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1604, "span_end": 1668, "span_text": "as fitting a line through data points representing paired values", "input_text": "as fitting a line through data points representing paired values", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1672, "span_end": 1711, "span_text": "the independent and dependent variables", "input_text": "the independent and dependent variables", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1009, "span_end": 1070, "span_text": "to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties", "input_text": "to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Econometrics.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3io1lgzlk9xa1mtkvdnfr6lrhyf68l", "filename": "Library_of_Congress_Classification.txt", "story": "The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a system of library classification developed by the Library of Congress.

It is the only triply landlocked U.S. state. Nebraska's area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000\u00a0km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln, and its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. \n\nIndigenous peoples including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes lived in the region for thousands of years before European exploration.

The Dissected Till Plains is a region of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. The Great Plains occupy most of western Nebraska, characterized by treeless prairie, suitable for cattle-grazing. The state has a large agriculture sector and is a major producer of beef, pork, corn and soybeans. There are two major climatic zones: the eastern half of the state has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\"), with a unique warmer subtype considered \"warm-temperate\" near the southern plains like in Kansas and Oklahoma which have a predominantly humid subtropical climate. The western half has a primarily semi-arid climate (Koppen \"BSk\"). The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures, decreasing south through the state. Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer, but sometimes in autumn.

The water takes four hundred seconds to boil. Next, she cuts up the beef and puts it in a pan to fry it. When the beef is cooked she starts to cut the tomatoes.

There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts. \n\nThe term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions. Most countries now use the SI unit \"watt\" for measurement of power. With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1, 2010, the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit. \n\nThe development of the steam engine provided a reason to compare the output of horses with that of the engines that could replace them. In 1702, Thomas Savery wrote in \"The Miner's Friend\": \n\nSo that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses, working together at one time in such a work, can do, and for which there must be constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same.

But that wasn't the case. \"The people at the hospital said they had never seen anything like it,\" Mynatt recalls.

According to Marxist perspective, class conflict within capitalism arises due to intensifying contradictions between the highly productive mechanized and socialized production performed by the proletariat and the private ownership and appropriation of the surplus product (profit) by a small minority of the population who are private owners called the bourgeoisie. The contradiction between the forces and relations of production intensifies leading to crisis. The haute bourgeoisie and its managerial proxies are unable to manage the intensifying alienation of labor which the proletariat experiences, albeit with varying degrees of class consciousness, until social revolution ultimately results. The eventual long-term outcome of this revolution would be the establishment of socialism \u2013 a socioeconomic system based on social ownership of the means of production, distribution based on one's contribution and production organized directly for use. As the productive forces and technology continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would eventually give way to a communist stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "What kind of inquiry was originally used by Marxism?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "To do what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did it evaluate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did it originate?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where ustralian philosophers responsible for the theory?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which two philosophers are?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "And the other?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where are they from?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What are the private owners called?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who provides the labor force?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What does tension between these two groups result in?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What eventually happens due to the disagreement between them?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And what occurs as a result of this?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is that a form of economic system?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is it rooted in?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Of what?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What quote from Marx is given in the passage?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How is how much a person is given decided?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is another term for appropriation of the surplus product?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What view of social transformation is described?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 318, "span_end": 541, "span_text": "Marxist methodology originally used a method of economic and sociopolitical inquiry known as historical materialism to analyze and critique the development of capitalism and the role of class struggle in systemic economic c", "input_text": "historical materialism", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 411, "span_end": 444, "span_text": "historical materialism to analyze", "input_text": "to analyze", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 490, "span_text": "he development of capitalism an", "input_text": "capitalism", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 206, "span_end": 254, "span_text": " it originates from the mid-to-late 19th century", "input_text": "from the mid-to-late 19th century", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 262, "span_end": 316, "span_text": "f German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

KENNEDY PUTS HIS FOOT IN IT. \n\nOne morning, about two weeks after Charley's arrival at Red River, Harry Somerville found himself alone in Mr Kennedy's parlour. The old gentleman himself had just galloped away in the direction of the lower fort, to visit Charley, who was now formally installed there; Kate was busy in the kitchen, giving directions about dinner; and Jacques was away with Redfeather, visiting his numerous friends in the settlement: so that, for the first time since his arrival, Harry found himself at the hour of ten in the morning utterly lone, and with nothing very definite to do. Of course, the two weeks that had elapsed were not without their signs and symptoms, their minor accidents and incidents, in regard to the subject that filled his thoughts. Harry had fifty times been tossed alternately from the height of hope to the depth of despair, from the extreme of felicity to the uttermost verge of sorrow, and he began seriously to reflect, when he remembered his desperate resolution on the first night of his arrival, that if he did not \"do\" he certainly would \"die.\" This was quite a mistake, however, on Harry's part. Nobody ever did _die_ of unrequited love.

It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. \n\nA civil parish can range in size from a large town with a population of about 80,000 to a single village with fewer than a hundred inhabitants. In a limited number of cases a parish might include a whole city where city status has been granted by the Monarch. Reflecting this diverse nature, a civil parish may be known as a town, village, neighbourhood or community by resolution of its parish council. Approximately 35% of the English population live in a civil parish. As of 31 December 2015 there were 10,449 parishes in England. \n\nOn 1 April 2014, Queen's Park became the first civil parish in Greater London. Before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a London borough. \n\nThe division of land into ancient parishes was linked to the manorial system: parishes and manors often covered the same area and had the same boundaries. The manor was the principal unit of local administration and justice in the early rural economy. Later the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre, and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe. In the medieval period, responsibilities such as relief of the poor passed increasingly from the Lord of the Manor to the parish's rector, who in practice would delegate tasks among his vestry or the (often well-endowed) monasteries.

Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. \n\nGiven its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars. Between 431 and 404 BC, Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War, from which it emerged victorious, though at a great cost of lives lost. Sparta's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta's prominent role in Greece. However, it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC. It then underwent a long period of decline, especially in the Middle Ages, when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras. Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives. \n\nSparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which configured their entire society to maximize military proficiency at all costs, and completely focused on military training and excellence. Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates (Spartan citizens, who enjoyed full rights), mothakes (non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans), perioikoi (free residents, literally \"dwellers around\"), and helots (state-owned serfs, enslaved non-Spartan local population). Spartiates underwent the rigorous \"agoge\" training and education regimen, and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle.

Conversation between them, however, languished, for the Baron spoke only in monosyllables, and his attitude gave Wrayson the idea that he viewed his presence at the chate\u00e2u with disfavour. With stiff punctiliousness, he begged Wrayson to try some wonderful Burgundy, and passed a box of cigarettes. He did not, however, open any topic of conversation, and Wrayson, embarrassed in his choice of subjects by the fact that any remark he could make might sound like an attempt at gratifying his curiosity, remained also silent. In a very few minutes the Baron rose. \n\n\"You will take another glass of wine, sir?\" he asked. \n\nWrayson rose too with alacrity, and bowed his refusal. They recrossed the great hall and entered the drawing-room. Louise and Madame de Melbain were talking earnestly together in a corner, and from the look that the latter threw at him as they entered, Wrayson was convinced that in some way he was concerned with the subject of their conversation.

Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued. DRM can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the fair use doctrine, and under French law.

MusicBrainz was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the Compact Disc Database (CDDB), a database for software applications to look up audio CD (compact disc) information on the Internet. MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a compact disc metadata (this is information about the performers, artists, songwriters, etc.) storehouse to become a structured open online database for music. \n\nMusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written . Recorded works can also store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, cover art, acoustic fingerprint, free-form annotation text and other metadata. , MusicBrainz contained information about roughly 1.1 million artists, 1.6 million releases, and 16 million recordings. End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tags to their digital media files, such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC. \n\nMusicBrainz allows contributors to upload cover art images of releases to the database; these images are hosted by Cover Art Archive (CAA), a joint project between Internet Archive and MusicBrainz started in 2012.

However, this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a restaurant for lunch each day before returning to the place we lived in. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I took lots of photos from the place we lived in, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam-powered trains are very popular. I took many photos of the train. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early. We usually have snow in January. It rained all day, then snowed in the evening .Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well. I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail , that Jenny is now working in a hotel.

In principle, the choice of standard state is arbitrary, although the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends a conventional set of standard states for general use. IUPAC recommends using a standard pressure \"p\"\u00a0= 10\u00a0Pa. Strictly speaking, temperature is not part of the definition of a standard state. For example, as discussed below, the standard state of a gas is conventionally chosen to be unit pressure (usually in bar) ideal gas, regardless of the temperature. However, most tables of thermodynamic quantities are compiled at specific temperatures, most commonly or, somewhat less commonly, . \n\nThe standard state should not be confused with standard temperature and pressure (STP) for gases, nor with the standard solutions used in analytical chemistry. \n\nFor a given material or substance, the standard state is the reference state for the material's thermodynamic state properties such as enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and for many other material standards. The standard enthalpy change of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, and this convention allows a wide range of other thermodynamic quantities to be calculated and tabulated. The standard state of a substance does not have to exist in nature: for example, it is possible to calculate values for steam at 298.15\u00a0K and 10\u00a0Pa, although steam does not exist (as a gas) under these conditions.

Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately. \n\nTuppence's spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \"Green Dragon\" bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero's face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion.

Dick had had the japanned box under his arm, and now held it up in triumph. \n\n\"Yes, we've got them all back, and those that don't go to the bank as collateral security for a loan are going to a safe deposit box,\" answered Dick. \"I won't take any more chances with an office safe.\" \n\n\"Especially not that office safe,\" put in Sam, pointedly. \n\n\"And what are you going to do with Jesse Pelter?\" questioned Nellie. \n\n\"We are going to put him where he belongs-- in prison,\" answered Tom. And it may be as well to state here that in due course of time Jesse Pelter and his partner in crime, Grimes, alias Haywood, were tried and sentenced to long terms in prison. At this trial it was brought to light that Barton Pelter had known about the hole in the back of the safe, but had had absolutely nothing to do with the taking of the bonds.

True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \"stem-birds\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What do fossil records say about birds?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did they evolve from?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What group?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did they first appear?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How long ago was that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What group are they classified as?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What are their characteristics?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many chambers does their heart have?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where do they live?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How big are they?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is the smallest?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How big are they?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is the largest?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is their size?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is their class rank?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How many living species are there?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What are half known as?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What is another name for that?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When did they diversify dramatically?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 543, "span_end": 615, "span_text": "The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs,", "input_text": "are the last surviving dinosaurs", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 616, "span_end": 656, "span_text": "having evolved from feathered ancestors ", "input_text": "from feathered ancestors", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 656, "span_end": 706, "span_text": "within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs", "input_text": "theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 708, "span_end": 762, "span_text": "True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period", "input_text": "during the Cretaceous period", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 764, "span_end": 793, "span_text": "around 100 million years ago.", "input_text": "around 100 million years ago", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 51, "span_text": "Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates", "input_text": "endothermic vertebrates", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 53, "span_end": 102, "span_text": "characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws,", "input_text": "feathers, toothless beaked jaws,", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 103, "span_end": 158, "span_text": "the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate,", "input_text": "the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate,", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 158, "span_end": 180, "span_text": " a four-chambered hear", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 222, "span_end": 242, "span_text": "Birds live worldwide", "input_text": "Birds live worldwide", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 247, "span_end": 260, "span_text": "range in size", "input_text": "range in size", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 281, "span_end": 297, "span_text": " bee hummingbird", "input_text": "bee hummingbird", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 269, "span_end": 281, "span_text": " 5 cm (2 in)", "input_text": "5 cm (2 in)", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 319, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "ostrich", "input_text": "ostrich", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 305, "span_end": 318, "span_text": "2.75 m (9 ft)", "input_text": "2.75 m (9 ft)", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 328, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "They rank as the class of tetrapods", "input_text": "tetrapods", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 363, "span_end": 423, "span_text": " with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand", "input_text": "approximately ten thousand", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 425, "span_end": 470, "span_text": "with more than half of these being passerines", "input_text": "passerines", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 471, "span_end": 505, "span_text": " sometimes known as perching birds", "input_text": "perching birds", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 822, "span_end": 915, "span_text": "t birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event", "input_text": "Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "BirdBird_5c77c521c298b4d76d088af8555cb4b0250d71f104b2581e37e91e1b"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3ns0a6kxc48ribjdggweghvkan8zg8", "filename": "middle486.txt", "story": "If you want to get a new cell phone number, don't forget to bring your ID with you .

Shaari, estimated to be in his late teens, was unable to move by himself and was transferred from Jazan in southern Saudi Arabia. \n\nDr. Aa'ed al-Qahtani, head of the medical team overseeing Shaari's treatment, told Sayidaty magazine in a recent interview that Shaari's health is continuing to improve at a steady rate. He has improved heart and lung function, reduced inflammation and improved muscle strength, including the ability to move his feet, he said. \n\nA massive custom-made wheelchair was built to help Shaari become more mobile and aid his physical therapy, al-Qahtani said. Shaari still cannot move on his own and needs to use a mechanized pulley to sit on the chair. Before being taken out of his house on a forklift, Shaari had not left his bed for three years, the magazine said. \n\nIn photos published in the magazine, which has launched an obesity awareness campaign, Shaari is shown smiling and holding up a victory sign.

A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on. \n\nThe nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies \u2013 organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is an NPO also known as?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is the purpose?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "are they all charities?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what do they usually serve?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what is a member serving kind?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what do the commnity ones do?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what is an implication of becoming non profit?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what do they do with extra money?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "rather than what?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what are some member serving types?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 67, "span_text": "A nonprofit organization (NPO, also known as a non-business entity)", "input_text": "a non-business entity", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 70, "span_end": 133, "span_text": " an organization whose purposes are other than making a profit.", "input_text": "an organization whose purposes are other than making a profit.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 736, "span_end": 856, "span_text": "The nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 985, "span_end": 1054, "span_text": " Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving.", "input_text": "they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1235, "span_end": 1295, "span_text": "organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e.", "input_text": "organizations that benefit a particular group of people", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1328, "span_end": 1463, "span_text": " Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: ", "input_text": "focus on providing services to the community in genera", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 543, "span_end": 644, "span_text": "The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, ", "input_text": "taxation implications", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 265, "span_end": 375, "span_text": "n economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission", "input_text": "it is used to further achieve its purpose or mission", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 377, "span_end": 495, "span_text": "rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends", "input_text": "than distributing its surplus income", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1054, "span_end": 1232, "span_text": " Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies", "input_text": "mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Nonprofit_organizationNonprofit_organization_cd5574abcee34ac89653a184f6cbcd031dc95dcac015d0e1cfc1ad1f"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3x66wabajwiqxickv915cgq5vprg34", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Charlotte Mary Yonge___The Stokesley Secret.txt/CHAPTER VII_90fa56b30cc7947575f169b229895e87605800ed81e1af1f37cca6c", "story": "CHAPTER VII. \n\n\n\nIt is not worth while to go on describing every day at Stokesley, since lessons were far too much alike; and play-times, though varied enough for the house of Merrifield, might be less entertaining to the readers. \n\nEnough to say, that by Saturday afternoon John had not only forfeited his last farthing, but was charged with another into next week, for the poor pleasure of leaving his hat on the school-room floor because Elizabeth had told him of it.

The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium. The immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to 25 years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March\u2013July 1815.

For most of its existence, Rutgers was a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. \n\nIn 1864, the college expanded its role in research and instruction in agriculture, engineering, and science when it was named as the state's sole land-grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862. \n\nIn 1924, it gained university status with the introduction of graduate education and further expansion. However, Rutgers evolved into a coeducational public research university after being designated \"The State University of New Jersey\" by the New Jersey Legislature in laws enacted in 1945 and 1956. It is one of only two colonial colleges that later became public universities. Rutgers, however, remains something of a public-private hybrid, in particular retaining certain \"private rights\" against unilateral changes in its governance, name, and structure that the state might otherwise want to impose.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did it gain university status?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What state is Rutgers in?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is it called?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What country is it located in?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Are their larger universities in new jersey?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is it public or private?", "turn_id": 6}], "answers": [{"span_start": 990, "span_end": 1027, "span_text": "In 1924, it gained university status ", "input_text": "In 1924", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 43, "span_text": "Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey", "input_text": "New Jersey", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 57, "span_end": 107, "span_text": "referred to as Rutgers University, Rutgers, or RU,", "input_text": "Rutgers University, Rutgers, or RU,", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 107, "span_end": 149, "span_text": " is an American public research university", "input_text": "America", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 150, "span_end": 215, "span_text": "and the largest institution for higher education in New Jersey. \n", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1370, "span_end": 1432, "span_text": "Rutgers, however, remains something of a public-private hybrid", "input_text": "both", "turn_id": 6}], "name": "Rutgers_University.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3ix2egzr7bjs7mnne5n4rrl1sq0jrg", "filename": "mc500.dev.10", "story": "Thunder can move a seesaw.

It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. \n\nThe U.S. Mail traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general. The Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin's operation, elevated to a cabinet-level department in 1872, and transformed in 1971 into the U.S. Postal Service as an agency of the U.S. government. \n\nThe USPS as of February 2015 has 617,254 active employees and operated 211,264 vehicles in 2014.

Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume, after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (which mandated $5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to fully prefund employee retirement health benefits, a requirement exceeding that of other government and private organizations), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume, prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit.

Following the invention of agriculture, hunter-gatherers have been displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world. \n\nOnly a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture and/or keeping animals. \n\nIn the 1950s, Lewis Binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging, not hunting. Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands, which allowed them to collect seafood, eggs, nuts, and fruits besides scavenging. Rather than killing large animals for meat, according to this view, they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes.

The first areas settled were on the Swan River, with the city's central business district and port (Fremantle) both located on its shores. \n\nPerth was founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. It gained city status (currently vested in the smaller City of Perth) in 1856, and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929. The city is named after Perth, Scotland, due to the influence of Sir George Murray, Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century. During Australia's involvement in World War II, Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre, and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay. An influx of immigrants after the war, predominantly from Britain, Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia, led to rapid population growth.

Muzaffar Jung set out for Hyderabad, accompanied by a French contingent under Bussy. On the way, the chiefs who had conspired against Nazir Jung mutinied against his successor. Muzaffar charged them with his cavalry. Two of the three chief conspirators were killed and, while pursuing the third, Muzaffar was himself killed. \n\n\"Bussy at once released from confinement a son of Nazir Jung, proclaimed him Subadar of the Deccan, escorted him to Hyderabad, and received from him the cession of considerable fresh grants of territory to the French. The latter were now everywhere triumphant, and Trichinopoli and Tanjore were, with the three towns held by the English, the sole places which resisted their authority. Muhammud Ali, deeming further resistance hopeless, had already opened negotiations with Dupleix for the surrender of Trichinopoli. Dupleix agreed to his conditions; but when Muhammud Ali found that Count Bussy, with the flower of the French force, had been despatched to Hyderabad, he gained time by raising fresh demands, which would require the ratification of the subadar. \n\n\"Luckily for us Mr. Floyer had been recalled, and his place taken by Mr. Saunders; who is, everyone says, a man of common sense and determination.

What about the people who invented the traffic light and the windshield wiper ? Shouldn' t we know who they are? \n\nJoan Mclean thinks so. In fact, Mclean, a professor of physics at Mountain University in Range, feels so strongly about this matter that she' s developed a course on the topic. In addition to learning \"who\" invented \"what\" , however, Mclean also likes her students to learn the answers to the \"why\" and \"how\" questions. According to Mclean, \"When students learn the answers to these questions, they are better prepared to recognize opportunities for inventing and more motivated to give inventing a try. \" \n\nHer students agree. One young man with a patent for an unbreakable umbrella is walking proof of McLean's statement. \"If I had not heard the story of the windshield wiper' s invention,\" said Tommy Lee, a senior physics major. \"I never would have dreamed of turning my bad experience during a rain storm into something so constructive. \" Lee is currently negotiating to sell his patent to an umbrella producer. \n\nSo, just what is the story behind the windshield wiper? Well, Mary Anderson came up with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City. The day was cold and stormy, but Anderson still wanted to see the sights, so she jumped aboard a streetcar. Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield, she found herself wondering why there couldn' t be a built - in device for cleaning the window. Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham, Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions. One of her ideas, a lever on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside, became the first windshield wiper. \n\nToday we benefit from countless inventions and innovations. It' s hard to imagine driving without Garrett A. Morgan' s traffic light. It' s equally impossible to picture a world without Katherine J. Blodgett' s innovation that makes glass invisible. Can you picture life without clear windows and eyeglasses?", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where does Joan Mclean work?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is her job title?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which questions does she want her students to answer?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is she preparing her students to become inventors?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did one of her students invent?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "and his major?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What year is he in school?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What bad experience led to his invention?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When was the idea for the windshield wiper brainstormed?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "By who?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where was she travelling?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where was her home?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What kind of weather sparked her creativity?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What did Garret A.

As he says, \"Why be you when you can be new?\" \n\nAided by a few misfit robots known as the Rustles-including Robin Williams as the cowardly Fender (\"I'm made of a metal called Afraidium\")-Rodney must track down the firm's founder, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), and convince him to save the city from Ratchet's plans. \n\nThe first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City. It's a wondrous world full of mechanical marvels including wind-up cars and walking streetlamps. \n\nAlso terrific are the special effects. This might be animated movie but at times you'll catch yourself thinking it's really a live-action film. \n\nOf course, there have been plenty of animated movies that looked the part but were let down by a weak storyline(see Shark Tale, for example). \n\nBut Robots grips right from the start thanks to a heart-warming and thoroughly engaging plot that never bores. \n\nMy only complaints are with Williams who, as usual, has a one-in-10 success rate with his jokes. Also a letdown is a romantic subplot between Rodney and a shapely robot called Cappy (Halle Berry) that doesn't go anywhere. \n\nComplains aside, this is a mechanical marvel that'll have you bolted firmly to your seat. \n\nBEST QUOTE :Fender:\"Even though you had a discouraging day, just remember there's another one coming tomorrow. \n\nBEST BIT:Check out those amazing images. \n\nWORST BIT:Robin Williams' character does an unfunny Britney Spears dance routine. \n\nIF YOU LIKED...Ice Age, The Incredibles, Toy Story...YOU'LL LIKE THIS.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What movie is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who plays Rodney?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is Rodney a human?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is Rodney from the big city?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where is he from?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where does Rodney go?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was he hoping to get a job?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who has taken over bigweld Industries?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is ratchet a good person?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What actor plays Ratchet?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What is the name of ratchets mom?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is the name of the actor who plays Madame gasket?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What are ratchets minions known as?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who can save the city?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Does this movie have good special effects?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What actor plays cappy?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is this an animated movie?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How does ratchet plan to make his fortune?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Does the movie ever get boring?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who performs a Britney Spears dance?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 182, "span_end": 267, "span_text": "Robots is the best animated film since The Incredibles.

No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear. \n\nBut when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety returned and haunted her.

A.L.T. also scored a hit later that year with his remake of the song Tequila. Cypress Hill, of which Mellow Man Ace was a member before going solo, would become the first Latino rap group to reach platinum status in 1991. The group has since continued to release other gold and platinum albums. Ecuadorian born rapper Gerardo received heavy rotation on video and radio for his single \"Rico, Suave\". While commercially watered-down, his album enjoyed a status of being one of the first mainstream Spanglish CDs on the market. Johnny J was a multi-platinum songwriter, music producer, and rapper who was perhaps best known for his production on Tupac Shakur's albums All Eyez on Me and Me Against the World.

A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 \u00b7 3, 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3. \n\nThe property of being prime (or not) is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.

It was successful at once. This year, Alipay Wallet , the payment system run by Alibaba, is ready to take on the competition. It is allowing its 190 million users to send digital gifts, especially on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. For the past few weeks a digital battle has been terrible, with Tencent banning Alipay from sending red envelopes on WeChat, saying they were at a risk.

It is one of the world's most important economic sectors by revenue. The automotive industry does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles following delivery to the end-user, such as automobile repair shops and motor fuel filling stations. \n\nThe term \"automotive\" was created from Greek \"autos\" (self), and Latin \"motivus\" (of motion) to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. This term was proposed by Elmer Sperry. \n\nThe automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994.

Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains. \n\nThe successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include host defense mechanisms, the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection. Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration, in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial. To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was demonstrated in 1943?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "By what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What has been less effective?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What kind?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is dependent on several factors?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What does that include?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What might depend on the growth phase?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does it require?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What might get rid of infections?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 496, "span_end": 614, "span_text": "antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943", "input_text": "antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 614, "span_end": 648, "span_text": " by the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment.", "input_text": "the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 647, "span_end": 803, "span_text": ".

It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames.

It wasn't insurance but a program that advertised deep discounts at doctors' offices and hospitals. \n\nMurray immediately signed up for the program, which she says advertised $30 doctor visits and $50 visits to specialists. \n\n\"It was pretty phenomenal,\" Murray said. \"They promised me everything was included,\" including doctor visits, vision, dental and hospital stays. \"They even mentioned the Mayo Clinic.\" \n\nMurray paid $314 for the card up front and then $179 each month after that. \n\nHer daughter made an appointment to see Dr. Robert Epsten, a San Diego, California, gastroenterologist, to get treatment for her Crohn's disease. \n\nEpsten was listed on Direct Med's Web site as being part of its network, but when Meredith arrived at Epsten's office, his staff said they didn't accept the Direct Med card. In fact, they said they'd never even heard of Direct Med, Hope Murray says. \n\nAccording to Murray, this same scene played out with several other doctors and hospitals. \n\n\"I have never been more angry, more furious about anything in my life,\" Murray said. \"It is a bogus scam that hurts people.

I couldn't find anything,\" said Green, a history and social studies major. \n\nWith few employment options in his hometown of Bellingham, Washington, Green applied to teach English in a South Korean middle school through Reach to Teach, an organization that assists college graduates with finding teaching positions in Asia. Green, who counts trips to Canada as his only experience abroad, will be leaving for Seoul on March 20 for one year. \n\n\"I am scared. I've only had one major breakdown so far, ... but I'm really excited about being on my own ... somewhere completely new where I know absolutely no one,\" he said. \n\nLike Green, many recent college graduates are searching for alternatives to jumping into the job market in the face of the recession. An increasing number of young Americans are searching out paid positions teaching English in countries like South Korea, Japan, China and Spain as a means to expand their horizons and weather the economic doldrums. \n\nMitch Gordon, director of school relations for Reach to Teach, said his organization has seen more than a 100 percent increase in applications in the last six months, with 3,784 applicants compared to 1,488 during the same six-month period last year. The application system doesn't track U.S. applicants separately, but Gordon estimates more than 70 percent are from the United States.
