THE DAUGHTER OF WITHERSTEEN \n\n\"Lassiter, will you be my rider?\" Jane had asked him. \n\n\"I reckon so,\" he had replied. \n\nFew as the words were, Jane knew how infinitely much they implied. She wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save them if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud all she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself. Whatever the price to be paid, she must keep Lassiter close to her; she must shield from him the man who had led Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. In her fear she so controlled her mind that she did not whisper this Mormon's name to her own soul, she did not even think it. Besides, beyond this thing she regarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her, was the need of a helper, of a friend, of a champion in this critical time. If she could rule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him from shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her? Never would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters shouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then what she could do might put off the fatal day. \n\nOne of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones.

He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \n\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \n\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta.

THE INTERRUPTED MASS \n\nThe morning of that Wednesday of Corpus Christi, fateful to all concerned in this chronicle, dawned misty and grey, and the air was chilled by the wind that blew from the sea. The chapel bell tinkled out its summons, and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass. \n\nPresently came Monna Valentina, followed by her ladies, her pages, and lastly, Peppe, wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager anxiety and unrest. Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \n\nThere were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers. \n\nGonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that, as the events of which Fanfulla's letter had given them knowledge might lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls.

The population of Budapest is about three million, and the city is a very popular place for tourists. Visitors like to take boat rides along the Danube. Budapest is also known for its exciting nightlife. The best time to visit is summer since Budapest is very cold in winter. Los Angeles Los Angeles was founded in 1781. With 3.5 million people it is now the biggest city in California and the second largest city in the United States. It is famous for its modern highways, its movie stars, and its smog. When the city is really smoggy, you can't see the near-by Mountains. The weather is usually dry and warm. Visitors like to go to the film studios and to drive along Hollywood Street. There are many good beaches near the city, and Los Angeles is also close to Disneyland. Taipei Since the founding of Taipei in the 18th century, the city has grown to a population of 2.3 million. Taipei is an exciting city, but the weather is humid and not always pleasant. It's also a very busy city, and the streets are always full of people.

Chestnut said. \n\nAccording to court documents, Bus C, which is was the vehicle where the incident took place and the name of a specific hazing ritual, was parked in a dark corner, separate from the other buses provided by the company. \n\nThe suit also alleges that the bus and its air conditioning system were running at the time Champion was beaten and that the bus driver was standing guard at the door to prevent anyone from entering or exiting the vehicle. \n\nWhen Champion stepped off the bus at one point to vomit, the bus driver told him \"he would be alright as she forced him back onto the bus,\" the lawsuit claims. \n\nDespite a request for damages in excess of $15,000, Chestnut insisted the focus isn't money. It allows him to file subpoenas and take witness statements to further the investigation. \n\n\"We figure out how this happened, we figure out how to fix it, and then we stop it from happening again,\" Chestnut said. \n\nCalls to the bus company and its attorneys, Wicker, Smith, O'Hara, McCoy, and Ford, PA, for comment have not been returned.

The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy.

These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as \"waterfowl\" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \"poultry\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal. \n\nThe domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat.

He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. Ma has hit back at Wang, accusing him of abandoning their family. \n\nThe topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce. It seems Wang's situation has struck a chord with many - which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. \n\nThe divorce quickly became a top trending topic in China. According to micro blog Sina Weibo, posts with the hashtag \"Wang BaoQiang Divorce\" have been viewed over five billion times. Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like \"Wang Don't Cry\" \"Wang We Support You\", quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 47% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. \n\nBut why are they so interested? what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? \n\nSome people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope - of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to \"match\" at every level - be it in status, or physical appearance - for a relationship to work out. Wang and Ma's split has many people wondering if uneven matches are unlikely to succeed. \n\nA lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves. Wang has alleged that his wife transferred and hid some of the couple's assets.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \"On Nature\", disliked humor, \"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. \n\nHowever, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. \n\nIn the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \"The Daily Show\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. \n\nOf course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \"The Pussycat Dolls\", describing their hit song \"Don't Cha\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. \n\nA study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. \n\nOf course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another. \n\nThough 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of. \n\nWith that in mind, remember to laugh with humanity and sometimes at humanity.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is humor important in the opinion of the author?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where was the study done showing we look for humor when dating?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is mirrored by a culture?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who didn't like humor?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did he think it was?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who said it helps us see things less seriously?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When do we elected politicians in America?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is laughter important in this process?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What television show provides an outlet for this?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who jokes about a song?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What is it's name", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "By whom?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is humor only used to help?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is something less than positive that may appear there?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What might it be linked to?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What does the author see in his reflection?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What do they tell him?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "And what should we chuckle at besides ourselves?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 616, "span_end": 753, "span_text": "Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming?", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1406, "span_end": 1423, "span_text": "Loyola University", "input_text": "Loyola University", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 37, "span_end": 48, "span_text": " its humor.", "input_text": "its humor.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 102, "span_end": 115, "span_text": "Thomas Hobbes", "input_text": "Thomas Hobbes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 284, "span_end": 329, "span_text": "a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness", "input_text": "a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 341, "span_end": 358, "span_text": " Mordechai Gordon", "input_text": "Mordechai Gordon", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 579, "span_end": 595, "span_text": "every four years", "input_text": "every four years", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 616, "span_end": 753, "span_text": "Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming?", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 775, "span_end": 792, "span_text": " \"The Daily Show\"", "input_text": "\"The Daily Show\"", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1164, "span_end": 1179, "span_text": " Hari Kondabolu", "input_text": "Hari Kondabolu", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1285, "span_end": 1297, "span_text": " \"Don't Cha\"", "input_text": "\"Don't Cha\"", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1237, "span_end": 1259, "span_text": " \"The Pussycat Dolls\",", "input_text": "\"The Pussycat Dolls\",", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1614, "span_end": 1658, "span_text": " humor is not always used for good purposes.", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1312, "span_end": 1335, "span_text": "representation of women", "input_text": "representation of women", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1682, "span_end": 1702, "span_text": "vulgarity and racism", "input_text": "vulgarity and racism", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1956, "span_end": 1975, "span_text": " increased wrinkles", "input_text": "increased wrinkles", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1984, "span_end": 2050, "span_text": "that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of", "input_text": "That there is a comedy in everything.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1807, "span_end": 1858, "span_text": " our failures and our connection with one another.

Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. \n\nWelsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century.

Not a word was hinted to either the invalid or the school teacher regarding the inquiries Mr. Merrick was making about the deed to the Bogue timber lands, which, if found, would make the young couple independent. Joe was planning to exploit a new patent as soon as he could earn enough to get it introduced, and Ethel exhibited a sublime confidence in the boy's ability that rendered all question of money insignificant. \n\nJoe's sudden appearance in the land of his birth and his generally smashed up condition were a nine days' wonder in Millville. The gossips wanted to know all the whys and wherefores, but the boy kept his room in the hotel, or only walked out when accompanied by Ethel or one of the three nieces. Sometimes they took him to ride, as he grew better, and the fact that Joe \"were hand an' glove wi' the nabobs\" lent him a distinction he had never before possessed. \n\nMcNutt, always busy over somebody else's affairs, was very curious to know what had caused the accident Joe had suffered. Notwithstanding the little affair of the letter, in which he had not appeared with especial credit, Peggy made an effort to interview the young man that resulted in his complete discomfiture. But that did not deter him from indulging in various vivid speculations about Joe Wegg, which the simple villagers listened to with attention. For one thing, he confided to \"the boys\" at the store that, in his opinion, the man who had murdered Cap'n Wegg had tried to murder his son also, and it wasn't likely Joe could manage to escape him a second time. Another tale evolved from Peggy's fertile imagination was that Joe, being about to starve to death in the city, had turned burglar and been shot in the arm in an attempt at housebreaking.

Several of the region's universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology) have renowned research programs. In addition, Rochester is the site of many important inventions and innovations in consumer products. The Rochester area has been the birthplace to such corporations as Kodak, Western Union, Bausch & Lomb, Gleason and Xerox that conduct extensive research and manufacturing in the fields of industrial and consumer products. Until 2010, the Rochester metropolitan area was the second-largest regional economy in New York State, according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, after the New York City metropolitan area.

The teen turns 18 in May, police said. \n\nUntil the fatal shots ended Al-Jumalli's life, March 4 had been a day of fun and joy for Al-Jumaili and his family.

The explanation is this: when Cuffe was giving his subordinate instructions how to proceed, the possibility of detention struck the latter, and he bethought him of some expedient by which such an evil might be remedied. At his suggestion then, the signal of the guns was mentioned by the captain, in his letter to the commander-in-chief, and its importance pointed out.

He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. \n\nSoon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs \"numerous\" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. \n\nYang's frustration over his life as a migrant is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the \"ant tribe\", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. \n\nA survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the \"ants\" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the \"ants\" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. \n\nFor two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the \"ant community\" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. \n\nThe ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop \"second-and-third-tier cities\" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, \"ants\" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations. As in the case of Yang, he is optimistic about getting a new job soon, having received eight interview offers in a week after sending out his resume. The prospect of landing a higher-paying job keeps him hopeful of moving out of the slum district soon.

The writer said he was now \"doing Europe\" and having a good time generally. One portion of the letter read as follows: \n\n\"The authorities needn't look for me, for they will never find me. I struck a soft thing over here and am about seventy pounds to the good. Tell Dave Porter I could tell him something he would like to hear--about his folks--but I am not going to do it.

Tell him that some day I'll square up with him and put him in a bigger hole than he got me into.

Lucretia bore as little resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person. If she did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far greater capacity and reach. She had a deep judgment. A hasty alliance with a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well the clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was altogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country. She had no conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if willing, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet only on the threshold of the world. Lucretia therefore received the suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and indifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect for this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it. Although really younger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in all worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same age. She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before Coningsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage, while, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not to delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which she very frequently found herself.

Musicians use the guitar for almost all kinds of music. Country and western music would not be the same without a guitar. The traditional Spanish folk music called Flamenco could not exist without a guitar. The sound of American blues music would not be the same without the sad cry of the guitar. And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. \n\nMusic experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. \n\nMany famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. \n\nIn the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different. Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music. Listen to this Les Paul recording. It was the fifth most popular song in the United States in 1952. It is called \"Meet Mister Callaghan.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What muscial instrument is being talked about here?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What kind of music you usually hear a guitar?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where was it first played?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What about the modern guitar?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did any famous muscians play the guitar in those times?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When was the electric guitar famous?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "who was les paul", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he use a special guitar?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did it look like", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did Les have any popular songs?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 97, "span_end": 106, "span_text": "the guita", "input_text": "the guitar", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 117, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "t all kinds of music", "input_text": "all kinds of music", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 621, "span_end": 627, "span_text": " Egypt", "input_text": "Egypt", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1110, "span_end": 1117, "span_text": "Spanish", "input_text": "Spain", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 953, "span_end": 969, "span_text": "Niccole Paganism", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 953, "span_end": 969, "span_text": "Niccole Paganism", "input_text": "Niccole Paganism", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1388, "span_end": 1392, "span_text": "1952", "input_text": "1952", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1204, "span_end": 1260, "span_text": " Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar", "input_text": "A guitar player", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1443, "span_end": 1556, "span_text": "The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very differen", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1443, "span_end": 1527, "span_text": "The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar", "input_text": "Like a traditional guitar?", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1559, "span_end": 1658, "span_text": "Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high14494.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "37qw5d2zrgmfokrh2qqisbhjy9hs85", "filename": "middle7497.txt", "story": "It's not just gloves that can help people keep warm in winter.

Two parallel set of charts are concurrently produced and published, one on behalf of Belgium's Dutch-speaking Flanders region, and the other catering to the nation's French-speaking region of Wallonia. \n\nThe music charts produced by Ultratop organization are separated along regional-language boundaries, an unusual division that is justified by the cultural differences in Belgium. So it is that the Dutch-speaking Flanders region has one set of charts of record activity there, while the French-speaking Wallonia region has another set to measure popularity in those provinces. \n\nThe charts are broadcast on several Belgian radio stations, and on TV stations TMF in Flanders and Plug RTL in Wallonia. \n\nUltratop creates charts based on record sales of around 500 retail outlets and legal digital downloads. Currently GfK is the market observer of the charts. The chart broadcasts on Radio Contact on Saturdays from 12:00 to 14:00.

Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, Elizabeth I, who died without issue. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and styled himself \"King of Great Britain and Ireland\".

It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. \n\nIntel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words \"int\"egrated and \"el\"ectronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). The fact that \"intel\" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate. Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the subject of the article?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where is the company's headquarters?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "ALso known as?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did Intel invent?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When was Intel founded?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Name one founder.", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "And the other?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What two words were used to make the company's name?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did Intel make the world's first of?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 17, "span_text": "Intel Corporation", "input_text": "Details about Intel Corporation", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 140, "span_end": 164, "span_text": "Santa Clara, California ", "input_text": "Santa Clara, California", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 194, "span_end": 208, "span_text": "Silicon Valley", "input_text": "Silicon Valley", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 447, "span_end": 532, "span_text": "x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).", "input_text": "x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 874, "span_end": 888, "span_text": " July 18, 1968", "input_text": "July 18, 1968", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 916, "span_end": 929, "span_text": "Robert Noyce ", "input_text": "Robert Noyce", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 933, "span_end": 945, "span_text": "Gordon Moore", "input_text": "Gordon Moore", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1087, "span_end": 1118, "span_text": " \"int\"egrated and \"el\"ectronics", "input_text": "\"int\"egrated and \"el\"ectronics", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1463, "span_end": 1493, "span_text": "commercial microprocessor chip", "input_text": "commercial microprocessor chip", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1497, "span_end": 1501, "span_text": "1971", "input_text": "1971", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Intel.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3rkntxvs3mya5nil9neeqz78bwp4ak", "filename": "cnn_8d76f09ab7fbce83d545ad34a88f2ff6448b1040.story", "story": "(CNN) -- ISIS has released a new video of British hostage John Cantlie, this time showing him in the Syrian border city of Kobani. \n\nIn a segment that lasts for more than five minutes, Cantlie argues that -- unlike Western media accounts of recent days -- Kobani is mostly under control of the terror group, which calls itself the Islamic state. \n\nHe claims that ISIS fighters are mopping up, and that the all-out battle for the city is over.

The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \"greater confusion of purpose\", yet led to a war noted for its \"notoriously incompetent international butchery.\" \n\nWhile the churches eventually worked out their differences and came to an initial agreement, both Nicholas I of Russia and Napoleon III refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate, and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to.

THE LAST JACOBITE RISING. \n\nWhile the Kirk was vainly striving to assuage the tempers of Mr Erskine and his friends, the Jacobites were preparing to fish in troubled waters. In 1739 Walpole was forced to declare war against Spain, and Walpole had previously sounded James as to his own chances of being trusted by that exiled prince. James thought that Walpole was merely angling for information. Meanwhile Jacobite affairs were managed by two rivals, Macgregor (calling himself Drummond) of Balhaldy and Murray of Broughton. The sanguine Balhaldy induced France to suppose that the Jacobites in England and Scotland were much more united, powerful, and ready for action than they really were, when Argyll left office in 1742, while Walpole fell from power, Carteret and the Duke of Newcastle succeeding. In 1743 Murray found that France, though now at war with England over the Spanish Succession, was holding aloof from the Jacobite cause, though plied with flourishing and fabulous reports from Balhaldy and the Jacobite Lord Sempill. But, in December 1743, on the strength of alleged Jacobite energy in England, Balhaldy obtained leave from France to visit Rome and bring Prince Charles. The Prince had kept himself in training for war and was eager. Taking leave of his father for the last time, Charles drove out of Rome on January 9, 1744; evaded, in disguise, every trap that was set for him, and landed at Antibes, reaching Paris on February 10. Louis did not receive him openly, if he received him at all; the Prince lurked at Gravelines in disguise, with the Earl Marischal, while winds and waves half ruined, and the approach of a British fleet drove into port, a French fleet of invasion under Roqueville (March 6, 7, 1744).

It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. \n\nMusic can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term \"genre \"itself. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of \"genre\", Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre \u2013 both are violin concertos \u2013 but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\" Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is music often divided into?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Are these objective categorizations?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is there distinct boundaries between all genres?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did Green publish?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many categories of Renassiance music did he list?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is dance one of those?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he argue that genre and form were essentially the same?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which pieces did he argue with the same genre but had different forms?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which works were examples of the exact opposite of that?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What genre would The Beethoven and Mendelssohn pieces be listed as?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Do van der Merwe and Moore argue the same point?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Which one of them thinks genre and style are the same?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How does he define it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is musical technique one way define a genre?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is another?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Is geographical origin ever used?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What is one issue with that?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who said that the term has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What type of framework has it become in his opinion?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What do recent academics think  about this type of categorization?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 367, "span_end": 409, "span_text": "Music can be divided into different genres", "input_text": "different genres", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 474, "span_end": 516, "span_text": "these classifications are often subjective", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 540, "span_end": 563, "span_text": "some genres may overlap", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 637, "span_end": 689, "span_text": "In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M.

Ibn Rushd was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Al Andalus (present-day Spain), and died at Marrakesh in present-day Morocco. His body was interred in his family tomb at C\u00f3rdoba. The 13th-century philosophical movement in Latin Christian and Jewish tradition based on Ibn Rushd's work is called Averroism. \n\nIbn Rushd was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Although highly regarded as a legal scholar of the Maliki school of Islamic law, Ibn Rushd's philosophical ideas were considered controversial in Ash'arite Muslim circles. Whereas al-Ghazali believed that any individual act of a natural phenomenon occurred only because God willed it to happen, Ibn Rushd insisted phenomena followed natural laws that God created. \n\nIbn Rushd had a greater impact on Christian Europe, being known by the \"the Commentator\" for his detailed emendations to Aristotle.

However, this may not be completely true. \n\nPeople who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called \"galvanometer\". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. \n\nA man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects . \n\nBackster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. \n\nAnother scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain.

Now, if it had been a photograph of a pretty girl instead of a middle-aged man, we might have connected the two. Hallo!\" \n\nHe broke off in his speech and turned round. Standing in the doorway, looking at us, was Leonard de Cartienne, with a slight smile on his thin lips. \n\n\"Behold the missing link--I mean man!\" exclaimed Cecil. \"Good old Leonard! Do you know, you gave us quite a fright. We expected to find you here and the room was empty. Are you better?\" \n\n\"Yes, thanks! I'm all right now,\" he answered. \"I've been out in the yard and had a blow. What's Milly looking so scared about? And what was it I heard you say about a photograph?\" \n\n\"Father's likeness has gone,\" she explained, turning round with tears in her eyes. \"It was there on the mantelpiece this afternoon and now, when we came in to look at it, it has gone!\" \n\n\"I should think that, if it really has disappeared,\" de Cartienne remarked incredulously, \"the servant must have moved it. Ask her.\" \n\nMiss Hart rang the bell and in the meantime we looked about the room. It was all in vain. We could find no trace of it, nor could the servant who answered the summons give us any information. She had seen it in its usual place early in the morning when she had been dusting.

In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\" This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches.

Matilda told me she wanted to keep in touch, but couldn't remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore!

For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different. But Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine.

Pipo was asking people in the street for some change, in return for him helping them in any way he could. Pipo was very poor; he had no home and no family, so he made a living however he could. Even so, Pipo always had the biggest smiles on his face. \n\nJoe took to Pipo, so he decided to help him out in making some money. He went over next to Pipo, took off his hat, put it face-up on the ground, and started crying with the most pitiful of expressions. Ina few minutes, Joe's hat was full of coins and sweets, but when Joe offered all this to Pipo, Pipo declined. \"I prefer deserving what I receive,\" answered Pipo with his usual smile, \"It's much more fun making an effort to get things. Maybe I haven't gotten everything I've wanted, but I've done a load of interesting things.\" Teary Joe didn't answer; he just walked sadly away. Joe had got everything he wanted, but he'd done practically nothing of interest the whole day. \n\nThat evening, having returned home, Joe requested a delicious cake for his supper.

For comparison, Melissa McCarthy's last major film Bridesmaids (though it was in a supporting role) opened at $26.2 million, in 2,918 theaters. With an opening like this, big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon's R-rated comedy which has already surpassed its $35 million production budget. Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a $28.3 million opening weekend in July 2011, Bateman hasn't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles. Universal's The Change-Up (with Ryan Reynolds) opened at $13.5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only $37.1 million domestically, on a $52 million production budget. \n\nJonathan Levine's Warm Bodies took second place for its second weekend with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $36.7 million. This breaks Levine's record, beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature, the cancer dramedy 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which brought in $35 million. \n\nThe R-rated Hitchcock-style, prescription-drug thriller Side Effects (CinemaScore: B) ended up beating director Steven Soderbergh's January 2012 weekend opening of Haywire, earning $10 million weekend this weekend and averaging $3,845 per theater. We talked a little bit about stars Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum's box office history yesterday. Another star of Side Effects is Jude Law, and he's got a varied track record at the box office. He generally participates in ensemble casts -- Anna Karenina, the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Soderbergh's Contagion, The Holiday -- making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive. Side Effects has Soderbergh's name and another strong ensemble, and could go on to a respectable run, even though it won't reach Contagion heights (the epidemic thriller eventually grossed $76 million).

The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula that forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. \n\nThe English word \"Iberia\" was adapted from the use of the Ancient Greek word \u1f38\u03b2\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 by Greek geographers under the rule of the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula. At that time, the name did not describe a single political entity or a distinct population of people. Strabo's 'Iberia' was delineated from Keltik\u0113 (Gaul) by the Pyrenees and included the entire land mass southwest (he says \"west\") of there. \n\nThe ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the Phoenicians, by voyaging westward on the Mediterranean. Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term \"Iberia\", which he wrote about circa 500 BC. Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaeans that \"it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with... Iberia.\" According to Strabo, prior historians used \"Iberia\" to mean the country \"this side of the \u1f3e\u03b2\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" as far north as the river Rh\u00f4ne in France, but currently they set the Pyrenees as the limit.

But what if the drugs don't even work very well? There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years or declined greatly. The reason for this is interesting and even paradoxical. Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene . As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous -- yet many farmers still use them. \n\nTo understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz, a specialist in pig nutrition at Kansas State University. Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, \"people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies,\" he says. Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle. In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers. \n\nFast forward to the 1990s. Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically. \n\nPreviously, pigs were born and raised in one barn or in several barns close together. This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home. Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease. \n\nCraig Rowles, who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. There's not a piglet in sight. \"This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while,\" he says. \n\nA whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. \"That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market,\" Rowles says. \n\nThe groups are kept strictly separated from each other.

The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy.

Afterward ,they wanted to share a video from the party with their friends. They wanted to send it over the Internet. But at the time, the process of sharing videos that way was difficult. Using e-mail did not work and the friends complained that there, was no website to help them. So they created their own. They called their website YouTube. It made sharing videos easy, so the website soon became very popular. People watched 2.500 million videos in the first six months! Today, more than 70,000 new videos go up on YouTube each day. People watch more than 1,000 million videos a day. Many last no more than 10 minutes. These videos show all kinds of things, from sleeping cats to earthquakes. Most of the filmmakers are not professionals. They are just everyday people making videos, and they use the website in many interesting ways. First many people use YouTube to entertain others. One example is Judson Laipply. He made a funny dance video and put it on YouTube in 2006. People watched the video more than 10 million times in the first two weeks. Now people stop Judson on the street to ask, \"Are you the dance guy on Youtube?\" Some people have invited him to dance at their parties. A few women even asked to marry him. Judson wants to make more dance videos, and people look forward to seeing them. Other people use YouTube to advertise a business. David Taub does this. He is a guitar teacher and he sells videos of guitar lessons on his own website. He wanted to increase his business, so he put short videos with free lessons on YouTube. People enjoyed watching the lessons on YouTube, and afterward, many decided to go to David's own website. Now David sells hundreds of guitar lesson videos each week. People also use YouTube to help others. Ryan Fitzgerald is one example. Ryan is friendly young man who knows that some people are lonely and have no one to talk to. One day, he made a video of himself for YouTube. In the video, he gave his phone number and invited people to call him. In less than a week, he had more than 5,000 calls and messages from all over the world. These days, he is very busy talking on the phone. He helps people when he can, but mostly, he just listens, like a friend. Finally, some filmmakers use YouTube in a more serious way. They want to inform people about important events happening in the world. For example, they show clips of videos from countries at war, or they show people in need of help after a storm. Sometimes TV news shows do not give enough information about these events. Thanks to YouTube filmmakers, people can go to their computers and learn more. For many people, YouTube is more than just another website to visit. It is a way to communicate with others. More and more people are using it every day, and they will probably find even more ways to use it.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many men are credited with the invention of Youtube?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was it immediately popular?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is it still?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many videos are uploaded every day?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And how many are watched?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did Judson Laipply upload a video?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was the video of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was it instantaneously popular?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do people recognize him?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Can youtube be used to generate money?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What kind of lessons does David upload?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Do you have to pay to watch them?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did it increase his customers?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many calls did he receive in a week?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What video did the men originally want to share?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Could they have used email?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Do you have to be a professional to upload videos?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 8, "span_end": 14, "span_text": " three", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 3, "span_end": 7, "span_text": "2004", "input_text": "2004", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 410, "span_end": 540, "span_text": "It made sharing videos easy, so the website soon became very popular.

Millions upon millions of people have read it in over 25 different languages, but fewer know about the author and the history of the composition of the creative masterwork. \n\nJohn Ronald Refuel Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1892. His parents died when he was a child. Living in England with his aunt, Tolkien and his cousins made up play languages, a hobby that led to Tolkien's becoming skilled in Welsh, Greek, Gothic, Old Norse and Anglo--Saxon. \n\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Tolkien served in World War I. In 1917, while recovering from trench fever he began composing the mythology for The Rings. As a professor of Anglo-Saxon in the 1930s at Oxford, Tolkien was part of an informal discussion group called the Inklings, which included several writers. The group was soon 1istening to chapters of Tolkien's imaginative work \"The Hobbit\". \n\nHobbit was a name Tolkien created for people that could best be described as half-sized members of the English rural class. Hobbits live in hillside holes. One of them,Bilbo Baggins, looks for treasures with a group of dwarves . On the way, he meets the twisted, pitiful creature Gollum, from whom he sees a golden ring that makes the holder invisible. \n\nOne of Tolkien's students persuaded her employer, publisher Allen & Unwind, to look at a draft .

The Chaldeans, for instance, give us his story, merely altering his name into Xisuthrus--a trivial alteration, which to an historian skilled in etymologies will appear wholly unimportant. It appears, likewise, that he had exchanged his tarpaulin and quadrant among the Chaldeans for the gorgeous insignia of royalty, and appears as a monarch in their annals. The Egyptians celebrate him under the name of Osiris; the Indians as Menu; the Greek and Roman writers confound him with Ogyges; and the Theban with Deucalion and Saturn. But the Chinese, who deservedly rank among the most extensive and authentic historians, inasmuch as they have known the world much longer than any one else, declare that Noah was no other than Fohi; and what gives this assertion some air of credibility is that it is a fact, admitted by the most enlightened _literati_, that Noah traveled into China, at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel (probably to improve himself in the study of languages), and the learned Dr. Shuckford gives us the additional information that the ark rested on a mountain on the frontiers of China.

Theories differ, but there's no doubt that Napoleon was a major influence. The French had used the right since at least the late 18th century.

Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany.

But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right. \n\nOne of the final moves to firmly standardize traffic directions in the U.S. occurred in the 20th century, when Henry Ford decided to mass-produce his cars with controls on the left (one reason, stated in 1908; the convenience for passengers exiting directly onto the edge, especially... if there is a lady to be considered). Once these rules were set, many countries eventually adjusted to the right-hand standard, including Canada in the 1920s, Sweden in 1967 and Burma in 1970.

One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at second-hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being \"hip\" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \"cool\". \n\nHipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox. \n\n\"I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt,\" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University in the US. Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity, especially regarding music.When lesser-known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes: I used to like that band before it got popular. \n\nAccording to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become \"less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity.\" \n\nMany young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster position. Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted the anti-mainstream culture. \n\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster. \n\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream. \n\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\" \n\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much? \n\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery . Writing in The New York Times, Wampole paints a less appreciative picture of a typical hipster. \n\n\"The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool.

The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles \u2013 Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south. Santa Monica is well known for its affluent single-family neighborhoods but also has many neighborhoods consisting primarily of condominiums and apartments. Over two-thirds of Santa Monica's residents are renters. The Census Bureau population for Santa Monica in 2010 was 89,736. \n\nSanta Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Cresp\u00ed on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs (Serra Springs), that were reminiscent of the tears that Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What city borders Santa Monica to the North", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who had been living there for awhile?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When did Gaspar first camp there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is it known for in the current day?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What kind of neighborhoods are there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Are the families generally considered to be in lower social classes?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "In one of the versions of the naming who cried the tears the springs reminded people of?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was she crying about?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the other story of the naming?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When is that actual date?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What kind of city is it?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 234, "span_end": 251, "span_text": "Pacific Palisades", "input_text": "Pacific Palisades", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 690, "span_end": 703, "span_text": "Tongva people", "input_text": "Tongva people", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 940, "span_end": 954, "span_text": "August 3, 1769", "input_text": "August 3, 1769", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 893, "span_end": 936, "span_text": "intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues", "input_text": "intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 413, "span_end": 426, "span_text": "single-family", "input_text": "single-family", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 404, "span_end": 412, "span_text": "affluent", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1318, "span_end": 1330, "span_text": "Saint Monica", "input_text": "Saint Monica", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1341, "span_end": 1364, "span_text": "her son's early impiety", "input_text": "her son's early impiety", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1059, "span_end": 1084, "span_text": "feast day of Saint Monica", "input_text": "feast day of Saint Monica", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1144, "span_end": 1149, "span_text": "May 4", "input_text": "May 4", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 18, "span_end": 28, "span_text": "beachfront", "input_text": "beachfront", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Santa_Monica,_CaliforniaSanta_Monica,_California_f56a12437397f40025eaa0200a5c52d9fe4239951c83372d7e0efa03"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3gna64guze4komt2coualrsrf78q5e", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Rafael Sabatini___Scaramouche.txt/CHAPTER IV_f4ca94af7e72eb1c9a93be2392ce6d78cdb33611e0322aa4d5687fb", "story": "CHAPTER IV.

For years, he had always been planning to paint a work of art, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Johnsy and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf on the old ivy vine climbing hopelessly up the outside block wall. \n\nOld Behrman was angered at such an idea. \"Are there people in the world with the foolishness to die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly business come in her brain?\" \n\n\"She is very sick and weak,\" said Sue, \"and the disease has left her mind full of strange ideas.\" \n\n\"This is not any place in which one so good as Miss Johnsy shall lie sick,\" yelled Behrman. \"Some day I will paint a masterpiece, and we shall all go away.\" \n\nJohnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. \n\nThe next morning, Sue awoke after an hour's sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. \"Pull up the shade; I want to see,\" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed. \n\nAfter the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. It was still dark green at the center. But its edges were color1ed with the yellow. It hung bravely from the branch about seven meters above the ground. \n\n\"It is the last one,\" said Johnsy. \"I thought it would surely fail during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.\" \n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Sue, leaning her worn face down toward the bed. \"Think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?\" But Johnsy did not answer. \n\nThe next morning, when it was light, Johnsy demanded that the window shade be raised. The ivy leaf was still there. Johnsy lay for a long time, looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was preparing chicken soup. \n\n\"I've been a bad girl,\" said Johnsy. \"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how bad I was. It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.\" \n\nAn hour later she said: \"someday I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.\" \n\nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hallway. \"Even chances. With good care, you'll win,\" said the doctor. \"And now I must see another case I have in your building. Behrman, whose name is some kind of an artist, I believe, has Pneumonia , too. He is an old, weak man and his case is severe. There is no hope for him, but he goes to the hospital today to ease his pain.\" \n\nThe next day, the doctor said to Sue:\" She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.\" \n\nLater that day, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, and put one arm around her. \"I have something to tell you, white mouse,\" she said, \"Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick only two days. They found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night. \n\n\"And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been moved from its place. And art supplies and a painting board with green and yellow color1s mixed on it. \n\n\"Look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall.

And Mr. Freeland's gone.\" \n\nSusie added: \"The dog's gone, too.\" \n\n\"Then help me to get some tea.\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\nWith the assistance of the mother-child, and the hindrance of Susie and Billy, Nedda made and laid tea, with an anxious heart. The absence of her aunt, who so seldom went outside the cottage, fields, and orchard, disturbed her; and, while Felix refreshed himself, she fluttered several times on varying pretexts to the wicket gate. \n\nAt her third visit, from the direction of the church, she saw figures coming on the road--dark figures carrying something, followed by others walking alongside. What sun there had been had quite given in to heavy clouds; the light was dull, the elm-trees dark; and not till they were within two hundred yards could Nedda make out that these were figures of policemen. Then, alongside that which they were carrying, she saw her aunt's blue dress. WHAT were they carrying like that? She dashed down the steps, and stopped. No! If it were HE they would bring him in! She rushed back again, distracted. She could see now a form stretched on a hurdle. It WAS he! \n\n\"Dad! Quick!\" \n\nFelix came, startled at that cry, to find his little daughter on the path wringing her hands and flying back to the wicket gate. They were close now. She saw them begin to mount the steps, those behind raising their arms so that the hurdle should be level.

Most pubs offer a range of beers, wines, spirits, and soft drinks and snacks.

But for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us dogs included squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix. I admit it: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd got away from. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did. A lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, I came to the opposite conclusion: your strict parenting made me more independent . Everybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you refused to take because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people believe that Lulu and I will feel hurt for life. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't put my heart into it. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel hurt at all. There's one more thing: I have come to understand what it really means to live a meaningful life to the fullest. To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind. You feel _ when the piano piece you've practiced for days and hours finally comes to life beneath your fingertips. You feel _ when you do something on your own that you never thought you could.

Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence.

It was, at once, improbable yet typical of a man who was as comfortable in the salons of power as he was in the embrace of the disadvantaged. \n\nChuck was the last man you'd pick out of a lineup of guys suspected of aiding and abetting dangerous felons. In his horn-rimmed glasses, hand-tied, silk bowties and graying crew cut, he looked like a grown-up version of the nerds that tough guys used to beat up to burnish their reps. \n\nBut fugitives who were wanted for vicious assaults and heinous crimes would call Chuck before they called their lawyers. In a town where some cops were known to administer curbside justice, surrendering to Chuck Stone was a way to keep from having their faces rearranged on the way to jail. At least 75 fugitives did just that over Stone's 19-year career.

It was historically a part of Lancashire, although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. \n\nManchester achieved city status in 1853. The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to the sea, to the west. Its fortunes declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where is Manchester located?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is the population?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is it the UK's most populated area?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What year did it become a city?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was opened in 1894?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is located to it's south?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is the governing authority?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where did the history begin?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "During what time was it a manorial township?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "During what period did textile manufacturing increase dramatically?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was the result of the increase in manufacturing?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "In what direction was the city linked to the sea?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What happened after WWII?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 20, "span_end": 80, "span_text": "ity and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England,", "input_text": "Greater Manchester, England,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 88, "span_end": 110, "span_text": "population of 530,300 ", "input_text": "530,300", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 148, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "second-most populous urban area,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1138, "span_end": 1177, "span_text": "Manchester achieved city status in 1853", "input_text": "1853", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1179, "span_end": 1219, "span_text": "The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894", "input_text": "The Manchester Ship Canal", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 272, "span_text": "Cheshire Plain to the south", "input_text": "the Cheshire Plain", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 375, "span_end": 421, "span_text": "The local authority is Manchester City Council", "input_text": "Manchester City Council", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 426, "span_end": 539, "span_text": "he recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of \"Mamucium\"", "input_text": "with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of \"Mamucium\"", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 530, "span_end": 593, "span_text": "Mamucium\" or \"Mancunium\", which was established in about AD 79 ", "input_text": "about AD 79", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 802, "span_end": 868, "span_text": "Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township", "input_text": "Throughout the Middle Ages till the turn of the 19th century.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1004, "span_end": 1068, "span_text": " a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution,", "input_text": "during the Industrial Revolution,", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1069, "span_end": 1134, "span_text": "and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city", "input_text": "it becoming the world's first industrialised city", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1258, "span_end": 1297, "span_text": "inking the city to the sea, to the west", "input_text": "to the west", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1299, "span_end": 1347, "span_text": "Its fortunes declined after the Second World War", "input_text": "Its fortunes declined", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1321, "span_end": 1377, "span_text": "after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation", "input_text": "deindustrialisation", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "Manchester.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3dh6gaktyypr424damiknh2oe5yzyd", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Anthony Trollope___Is He Popenjoy?.txt/CHAPTER XXV_3c4b09ffe3e0f425f323f5866a1e039808e16fd1c38f623d21aa3ca", "story": "CHAPTER XXV. \n\nLADY SUSANNA IN LONDON. \n\nIn spite of the caution which he had received from his friend and cousin Mrs. Houghton, Jack De Baron did go to Munster Court during the absence of Lord George, and there did encounter Lady Susanna.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population.

Cecco had been attracted with the rest towards the Piazza, and she found Baldassarre standing alone against the church-door, with the horn-cup in his hand, waiting for her. There was a striking change in him: the blank, dreamy glance of a half-returned consciousness had given place to a fierceness which, as she advanced and spoke to him, flashed upon her as if she had been its object. It was the glance of caged fury that sees its prey passing safe beyond the bars. \n\nRomola started as the glance was turned on her, but her immediate thought was that he had seen Tito. And as she felt the look of hatred grating on her, something like a hope arose that this man might be the criminal, and that her husband might not have been guilty towards him. If she could learn that now, by bringing Tito face to face with him, and have her mind set at rest! \n\n\"If you will come with me,\" she said, \"I can give you shelter and food until you are quite rested and strong.

It calls the territories under its control the Liberated Territories or the Free Zone. Morocco controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The SADR government considers the Moroccan-held territory to be occupied territory, while Morocco considers the much smaller SADR-held territory to be a buffer zone. The claimed capital of the SADR is El-Aai\u00fan, while the temporary capital has been moved from Bir Lehlou to Tifariti. \n\nThe Sahrawi Republic maintains diplomatic relations with 40 UN states, and is a full member of the African Union. \n\nFollowing the Spanish evacuation of Spanish Sahara, Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania signed the Madrid Accords on November 14, 1975, leading to both Morocco and Mauritania moving in to annex the territory of Western Sahara. On 26 February 1976, Spain informed the United Nations that as of that date it had terminated its presence in Western Sahara and relinquished its responsibilities, leaving no Administering Power. Neither Morocco nor Mauritania gained international recognition, and war ensued with the independence-seeking Polisario Front.

It may wash away the inner confusion you feel right after being forced to make a choice between two appealing choices, according to a new study. The study builds on the past research into a phenomenon known as \"the Macbeth effect\" . It turns out that Shakespeare was really onto something when he imagined Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands. A few years ago, scientists asked people to describe a past wrong act. If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned. This finding interested W. S. Lee, a researcher. \"Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,\" says Lee. He decided to test hand washing's effect on one kind of bad feeling:the tension we feel after being forced to choose between two attractive choices, because picking one choice makes us feel that we've lost the other. People usually try to calm this inner conflict by later exaggerating the positive aspects of their choice. He had students rank 10 different music CDs. Then he offered students two of the CDs and told them to select one as a gift. Some students then used liquid soap. Others only looked at the soap or sniffed it. \"Actually, you do not need water and soap,\" says Lee. Later, the students again had to rank all the music CDs. People who didn't wash their hands had the normal response -- they scored their take-home CD higher, suggesting that they now saw it as an even more attractive one than before. But this wasn't true for the hand washers. They ranked the music about the same. \"They feel no need at all to justify (...)the choice,\" says Lee. But the effects of it just aren't clear. Schwarz says it's too soon to know whether people should head for a sink after making a tough choice. He says washing may help decision-makers by cleaning away mental disorder. But perhaps if they don't go through the usual post-decision process of justifying their choice, they might feel more sorrow in the long run.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who expressed less of something when they had washed up first.", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did they express less of?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What might get rid of more of a thing?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What might that get rid of more of?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is the phenomenon mentioned?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who was onto a thing?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was he onto?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Shakespeare imagine?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What might be washed away?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "anything else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was offered to pupils?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What were theyinstructed to do with them?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did some kids do with the soap?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "anything else?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who was the third President of the Galactic Federation?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What might a person feel a greater amount of in the long run?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What kind of soap did some kids use?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 532, "span_end": 652, "span_text": "If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.", "input_text": "people who were given a chance to clean their hands.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 589, "span_end": 652, "span_text": "they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.", "input_text": "guilt", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 61, "span_text": "Soaping up your hands may do more than just get rid of germs.", "input_text": "Soaping up your hands", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 43, "span_end": 61, "span_text": " get rid of germs.", "input_text": "germs.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 250, "span_end": 292, "span_text": "a phenomenon known as \"the Macbeth effect\"", "input_text": "the Macbeth effect", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 350, "span_text": " It turns out that Shakespeare was really onto something", "input_text": "Shakespeare", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 652, "span_text": " If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.", "input_text": "If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 368, "span_end": 460, "span_text": "Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands.", "input_text": "Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 703, "span_end": 793, "span_text": "Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,\"", "input_text": "Anything from the past", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 701, "span_end": 793, "span_text": " \"Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,\"", "input_text": "any kind of negative emotional experiences", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1173, "span_end": 1251, "span_text": "Then he offered students two of the CDs and told them to select one as a gift.", "input_text": "CDs", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1173, "span_end": 1251, "span_text": "Then he offered students two of the CDs and told them to select one as a gift.", "input_text": "to select one as a gift.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1289, "span_end": 1334, "span_text": "Others only looked at the soap or sniffed it.", "input_text": "looked at the soap", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1289, "span_end": 1335, "span_text": "Others only looked at the soap or sniffed it.

MONSIEUR LE BARON \n\nThe sun beat down mercilessly on thatch and terrace, the yellow walls flung back the quivering heat, as Madame la Vicomtesse and I walked through the empty streets towards the Governor's house. We were followed by Andre and Madame's maid. The sleepy orderly started up from under the archway at our approach, bowed profoundly to Madame, looked askance at me, and declared, with a thousand regrets, that Monsieur le Baron was having his siesta. \n\n\"Then you will wake him,\" said Madame la Vicomtesse. \n\nWake Monsieur le Baron! Bueno Dios, did Madame understand what it meant to wake his Excellency? His Excellency would at first be angry, no doubt. Angry? As an Andalusian bull, Madame. Once, when his Excellency had first come to the province, he, the orderly, had presumed to awake him. \n\n\"Assez!\" said Madame, so suddenly that the man straightened and looked at her again. \"You will wake Monsieur le Baron, and tell him that Madame la Vicomtesse d'Ivry-le-Tour has something of importance to say to him.\" \n\nMadame had the air, and a title carried with a Spanish soldier in New Orleans in those days. The orderly fairly swept the ground and led us through a court where the sun drew bewildering hot odors from the fruits and flowers, into a darkened room which was the Baron's cabinet. I remember it vaguely, for my head was hot and throbbing from my exertions in such a climate. It was a new room,--the hotel being newly built,--with white walls, a picture of his Catholic Majesty and the royal arms of Spain, a map of Louisiana, another of New Orleans fortified, some walnut chairs, a desk with ink and sand and a seal, and a window, the closed lattice shutters of which showed streaks of light green light. These doubtless opened on the Royal Road and looked across the levee esplanade on the waters of the Mississippi.

It had been placed there since my last visit, and that same day I pushed Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing and round the other room, which, from that day on, became my regular job. \n\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, my sister's husband; then I explained my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help. But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services. \n\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would be seemingly kind to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would hold her tightly with great fondness, saying something quietly in her ear that sounded like \"Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "who is the narrator?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "does he work?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "for who?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "is he well compensated?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how is he compensated?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who is the young woman?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "was she around a lot?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "was she good looking?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "by who's standards?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "anyone else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "did someone push someone else?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1420, "span_end": 1443, "span_text": " Pip?\" And when I said ", "input_text": "Pip", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 895, "span_end": 1014, "span_text": "she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 275, "span_text": "ame day I pushed Miss Havisham", "input_text": "Miss Havisham", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 958, "span_end": 1015, "span_text": "nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services.", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 883, "span_end": 955, "span_text": "Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner", "input_text": "with daily dinner", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1018, "span_end": 1114, "span_text": "Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again", "input_text": "Estella", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1018, "span_end": 1042, "span_text": "Estella was always about", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1384, "span_end": 1419, "span_text": "Does she grow prettier and prettier", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1382, "span_end": 1461, "span_text": " \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham", "input_text": "Miss Havisham", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1383, "span_end": 1448, "span_text": "\"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes, ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1389, "span_end": 1446, "span_text": "she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said yes", "input_text": "Pip", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 253, "span_end": 275, "span_text": "I pushed Miss Havisham", "input_text": "Who was the pusher?", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "high14323.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3c6fju71tqtai3a34zjc6pn9dsluyw", "filename": "high4443.txt", "story": "\"Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life.\" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, \"There are no happy jobs, only happy workers.\" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics. \n\nFirst, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, \"My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'\" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys. \n\nSecond, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, \"I work with the coolest people in the world.\" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, \"There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying.\" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people. \n\nThird, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work. \n\nTony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, \"Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous.\" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is an author?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did she write?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is that her only book?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does she believe?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How does she feel about that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many characteristics  do happy workers share?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is the first one?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "The second?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "The third?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was Tony Hawk when he was young?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "At what age did he become this?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is he now?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does he have a child?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is it a son or daughter?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What did Sally Ayote say?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What does she do?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "For who?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who are those people?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What does Caroline Baron do?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 100, "span_end": 158, "span_text": "Joanne Gordon does.

The agency had no contact with the Anthonys prior to the girl's disappearance in the summer of 2008, Hoeppner added. \n\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Office will not take any further action as a result of the report, Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday. \n\n\"This closes out the DCF case, and it does not create additional follow-up on our part,\" he said. \n\nThe report said: \"The Department of Children and Families concludes that the actions or the lack of actions by the alleged perpetrator ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child.\" The report was signed by officials in the department Wednesday. \n\nAnthony is now free. While she was cleared on murder and aggravated child abuse charges, the 25-year-old Orlando woman was convicted on four counts related to misleading law enforcement authorities. She was sentenced to four years in jail on those convictions, but was given credit for the time she had already served between her arrest and the end of the seven-week trial and was released from jail in mid-July.

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

LUCREZIA'S THIRD MARRIAGE \n\nAt about the same time that Burchard was making in his Diarium those entries which reflect so grossly upon the Pope and Lucrezia, Gianluca Pozzi, the ambassador of Ferrara at the Vatican, was writing the following letter to his master, Duke Ercole, Lucrezia's father-in-law elect: \n\n\"This evening, after supper, I accompanied Messer Gerardo Saraceni to visit the Most Illustrious Madonna Lucrezia in your Excellency's name and that of the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso. We entered into a long discussion touching various matters. In truth she showed herself a prudent, discreet, and good-natured lady.\"(1) \n\n1 See Gregorovius's Lucrezia Borgia. \n\nThe handsome, athletic Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, with his brothers Sigismondo and Fernando, had arrived in Rome on December 23 with the imposing escort that was to accompany their brother Alfonso's bride back to Ferrara. \n\nCesare was prominent in the welcome given them. Never, perhaps, had he made greater display than on the occasion of his riding out to meet the Ferrarese, accompanied by no fewer than 4,000 men-at-arms, and mounted on a great war-horse whose trappings of cloth of gold and jewels were estimated at 10,000 ducats. \n\nThe days and nights that followed, until Lucrezia's departure a fortnight later, were days and nights of gaiety and merry-making at the Vatican; in banquets, dancing, the performance of comedies, masques, etc., was the time made to pass as agreeably as might be for the guests from Ferrara, and in all Cesare was conspicuous, either for the grace and zest with which he nightly danced, or for the skill and daring which he displayed in the daily joustings and entertainments, and more particularly in the bull-fight that was included in them.

He kept his ground until he reached a small hamlet named Kingsdown, lying about two and a half miles to the north of Saint Margaret's Bay.

They are to be married soon, or rather sooner, for I rather suspect that we shall receive announcements almost any day. On account of his father's death it is to be a very quiet affair--only blood relatives. \n\nWhile I was alone with Mr. Philander the old fellow became rather confidential.

If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great. Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \"Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\" Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework.

A black tail coat, burst at the elbows, stained with mud, was tightly buttoned across his chest.

A pair of gray flannel trousers and boots out of which two toes peeped coyly, completed the picture. \n\nEven Spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his appearance which would have distressed the editor of a men's fashion paper. \n\n\"'Scuse dese duds,\" he said. \"Me man's bin an' mislaid de trunk wit' me best suit in.

Cross-dressing to join the army \n\nUntil recently, women have rarely been allowed to serve as soldiers. \n\nSo what was a gal to do if she wanted to serve her country? Naturally, disguise herself as a man and join the troops. \n\nAt least 400 Civil War soldiers were women in drag. These included Union Army soldier \"Frank Thompson\" (also known as Sarah Edmonds), whose small frame and feminine mannerisms (rather than causing suspicion) made her an ideal spy, as she could spy on the Confederates disguised as... a woman! \n\nShe wasn't the first woman to don a male disguise and join the army, though. During the Revolutionary War, women fought as men on both sides. \n\nHannah Snell, for example, joined the British army to find her husband, who had walked out on her to enlist. \n\nOnce her true sex was discovered (thanks to a pesky groin injury), she became a national celebrity in Britain, and made a post-war career of performing in bars as the \"Female Warrior.\" Mental Floss: The Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America \n\n2. Cross-dressing to keep a royal family together \n\nWith all the power play that went on in the court, the French royal family would go to great lengths to avoid sibling rivalry. In one of the more extreme cases, Philippe I, Duke of Orleans (1640-1701), was raised as a girl to discourage him from any political or military aspirations.

Maggie was lucky because she and her family lived on the ground floor and they had a big back yard that had a fence. This meant she got to go outside and play! \n\nMaggie's family loved her very much. She knew this because they took such good care of her. She had her very own purple cat bed. She loved her bed, and purple. This was her favorite color and her favorite place to sleep. If she did not sleep on the lap of one of her family this was her favorite place to sleep. She also knew that they loved her because they made sure to feed her every day. In fact, they fed many times a day. This is why she was so large. \n\nOne day when she was in the yard a group of street cats came up to her. \"Oink, oink\" they said in mean voices. They were teasing her because she was so big.

He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. \n\nNot long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. \n\nAttorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. \n\n\"I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,\" Demiraj told CNN. \n\nBut Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston.

It is instead thrown away. Experts say food is wasted in both rich and poor countries, but for different reasons. \n\nElliot Woolley teaches sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, which was held earlier this month in Vietnam. \n\nMr. Woolley said in poor countries, food is usually lost while it is still in the field or during storage and transportation. He said that is because food producers there are inefficient. These businesses are unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time or energy. But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they buy. \n\nHowever, people in developed countries throw away as much as half of the food they purchase. In the US, big contributors to waste include supersized portions that customers simply can't manage, and\"eat as much as you want\"offers in restaurants. In the UK, over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items are key factors, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible. And efficient farming methods, transport and storage mean that most of the wastage occurs through retail and customer behavior. The British researcher called this custom\"adisgrace\". \n\nElliot Woolley has created a smartphone app that he says shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat. It also gives information on how people can combine the foods they have to make a meal. The software program is called\"Pantry App\". \n\nMr. Woolley said that people who used the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third. But this result came from a limited experiment -- users only followed their food use for a week. \n\nJeremy Bonvoisin is a student at the Technical University of Berlin. He attended the recent conference in Vietnam. He said one way to solve the problem of wasting food is to take steps to persuade people to stop buying so much food in the first place. He said people buy more food than they need because it is becoming less costly. They waste so much food because they buy more than they need. \n\nHe said the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy. But he is also worried that it could get people to waste more food because they no longer have to pay attention to how much they have bought.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who created a smart phone app?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is it called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does it do?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many run it daily?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What were the claimed results of this?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where does the author of the app teach?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's his name?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Do poor countries waste food as well?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who is the 2nd person mentioned in the article?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did he say?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1564, "span_end": 1578, "span_text": "Elliot Woolley", "input_text": "Elliot Woolley", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1831, "span_end": 1841, "span_text": "Pantry App", "input_text": "Pantry App", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1621, "span_end": 1710, "span_text": "shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat", "input_text": "shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1884, "span_end": 1941, "span_text": "the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third", "input_text": "the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 2079, "span_end": 2109, "span_text": "Technical University of Berlin", "input_text": "Technical University of Berlin", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1564, "span_end": 1579, "span_text": "Elliot Woolley ", "input_text": "Elliot Woolley", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 771, "span_end": 870, "span_text": " But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they bu", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 2042, "span_end": 2058, "span_text": "Jeremy Bonvoisin", "input_text": "Jeremy Bonvoisin", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2445, "span_end": 2536, "span_text": " the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy", "input_text": "the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "high19561.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3oxv7eaxleqo0pnejwsj0pdg1ci36l", "filename": "Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada.txt", "story": "The provinces and territories of Canada are the administrative divisions that are responsible for the delivery of sub-national governance within the geographical areas of Canada under the authority of the Canadian Constitution.

It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology; the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as \"justified true belief\", though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers to be problematic because of the Gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition. However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist. \n\nKnowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of \"acknowledgment\" in human beings. \n\nThe definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato, specifies that a statement must meet three in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified, true, and believed. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as Gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate.

The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum (\"French work\") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe.

Hyde Park was circled, incessantly, by turning wheels. \n\n\"The height of the season,\" said Bonamy sarcastically. \n\nHe was sarcastic because of Clara Durrant; because Jacob had come back from Greece very brown and lean, with his pockets full of Greek notes, which he pulled out when the chair man came for pence; because Jacob was silent. \n\n\"He has not said a word to show that he is glad to see me,\" thought Bonamy bitterly. \n\nThe motor cars passed incessantly over the bridge of the Serpentine; the upper classes walked upright, or bent themselves gracefully over the palings; the lower classes lay with their knees cocked up, flat on their backs; the sheep grazed on pointed wooden legs; small children ran down the sloping grass, stretched their arms, and fell. \n\n\"Very urbane,\" Jacob brought out. \n\n\"Urbane\" on the lips of Jacob had mysteriously all the shapeliness of a character which Bonamy thought daily more sublime, devastating, terrific than ever, though he was still, and perhaps would be for ever, barbaric, obscure. \n\nWhat superlatives!

The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany, which lies culturally in Central Germany, was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools. \n\nThe economy was centrally planned, and increasingly state-owned. Prices of basic goods and services were set by central government planners, rather than rising and falling through supply and demand. Although the GDR had to pay substantial war reparations to the USSR, it became the most successful economy in the Eastern Bloc. Nonetheless it did not match the economic growth of West Germany. Emigration to the West was a significant problem - as many of the emigrants were well-educated young people, it further weakened the state economically. The government fortified its western borders and, in 1961, built the Berlin Wall.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Whats a $20 coin called?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When did they stop making it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How much was a half union worth?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was the Coinage Act?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When did they consider calling $100 a Union?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What's a dime's value?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What system is the US dollar based on?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Were any Union coins ever made?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was thee any paper money worth less than a buck?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Which is worth more?

In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

These were the people who remembered hearing tales about footprints of an animal that walked like a human being. The five men, however, were not the first to have seen these creatures called Bigfoot. Long before their experience, the local Native Americans were certain that a group of apelike animals had been living in the _ mountain for centuries. In 1958, some workers, who were building a road through the jungles of Northern California, often found huge footprints in the earth around their camp. Then in 1967, Roger Patterson, a man who was interested in finding Bigfoot, went into the same jungles with a friend. While riding, they were suddenly thrown off from their horses. Patterson saw a tall apelike animal standing not far away. He managed to take photos of the hairy creature before it disappeared in the jungles. When Patterson's photos were shown to the public, not many people believed his story. Richard Brown, an experienced hunter, discovered a similar creature. He saw the animal clearly through the telescopic lens of his rifle . He said the creature looked more like a human being than an animal. Later many other people also found deep footprints in the same area.

And the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both, even (dare one say it) quixotic in a time of recession.

Historical records indicated Cervantes had been buried there, but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since. (Etxeberria, incidentally, performed the autopsy on former Chilean President Gen. Salvador Allende, confirming he had committed suicide.) \n\nAt a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday, Etxeberria said that while there was no mathematical proof or DNA test available to completely verify the findings, there were \"many coincidences and no discrepancies\" in the examination of \"Osario 32,\" a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people. \n\n\"We have Cervantes, represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented,\" Etxeberria told national television. \n\nThe search for Cervantes' coffin -- using radar -- began last year, funded by the Madrid City Council. It first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church.
