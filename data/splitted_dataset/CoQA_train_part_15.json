Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe. It was the right move. Harry's persistence and constant practice were about to pay off. To get people's attention, he walked into police stations and offered to be handcuffed by all the policemen. They were shocked when he was loose only seconds later. Soon, everyone in Europe was talking about Houdini's astounding skills. He was in high demand and found himself doing more and more dangerous acts. He escaped from a straitjacket hanging upside down over the street; he escaped from locked boxes of all kinds; and, of course, he got out of any kind of handcuffs put on him. After several years in Europe, Bess and Harry returned to the United States in victory. Harry was doing such amazing tricks that people felt he must have special powers. However, few realized how much time he spent practicing and studying. He would do special exercises to keep his body strong, and he would do tricks with his fingers to keep them flexible. He would spend large amounts of time tying and untying knots -- with his toes! For his underwater tricks, he would get in the bathtub and practice holding his breath for longer and longer times. Since many of his tricks involved being deep in icy water, he would pour buckets of ice in the tub to get accustomed to working in the cold. The reason that Harry Houdini was such a success was that he practiced and prepared for whatever might happen. When a college student punched him in the abdomen in 1926, however, he wasn't prepared. The punch did internal damage that not even this magician could get out of. Harry died in 1926 at 52 years of age -- a master of his trade and a true legend.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the story about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was that his real name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was he from the US?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where was his family from?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did they go in 1897?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was he an only child?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many siblings did he have?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was he able to do as a teenager?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he find that changed his path forever?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who was it about?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was he performing with someone?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was he the only assistant in his lifetime?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who else was his assistant?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Were they related?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Where did they eventually succeed?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What was his secret in remaining successful?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What happened that he was unprepared for?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Did he live?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 13, "span_text": "Harry Houdini", "input_text": "Harry Houdini", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 368, "span_end": 380, "span_text": "Ehrich Weiss", "input_text": "Ehrich Weiss", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 304, "span_end": 339, "span_text": "Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 322, "span_end": 339, "span_text": "Budapest, Hungary", "input_text": "Budapest, Hungary", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1963, "span_end": 1982, "span_text": "they went to Europe", "input_text": "Europe", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 381, "span_end": 408, "span_text": " the third of five children", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 382, "span_end": 408, "span_text": "the third of five children", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 657, "span_end": 700, "span_text": "he could pick almost any lock that was made", "input_text": "he could pick almost any lock that was made", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 852, "span_end": 909, "span_text": " he came across a book that would actually change his lif", "input_text": "a book", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 957, "span_end": 982, "span_text": "Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin", "input_text": "Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 752, "span_end": 767, "span_text": "brother, Theo, ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 748, "span_end": 765, "span_text": "his brother, Theo", "input_text": "his brother, Theo", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1463, "span_end": 1566, "span_text": " Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1452, "span_end": 1468, "span_text": "woman named Bess", "input_text": "woman named Bess", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1567, "span_end": 1591, "span_text": "They married immediately", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1567, "span_end": 1592, "span_text": "They married immediately ", "input_text": "husband and wife", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2243, "span_end": 2307, "span_text": "everyone in Europe was talking about Houdini's astounding skills", "input_text": "Europe", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 2774, "span_end": 2798, "span_text": " practicing and studying", "input_text": "practicing and studying", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 3372, "span_end": 3414, "span_text": "college student punched him in the abdomen", "input_text": "college student punched him in the abdomen", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 3529, "span_end": 3539, "span_text": "Harry died", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high21145.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "33sa9f9trxup42ihzymjhagqfp8ew2", "filename": "middle5955.txt", "story": "Green Eyes is a book.

It was like a dream. They went through a room where women, idling or working at tapestries, looked at them curiously. Margaret heard one of them say to another: \n\n\"Why does the Dona Margaret's cousin leave her?\" And the answer, \"Because she is in love with the marquis herself, and cannot bear to stay.\" \n\n\"What a fool!\" said the first woman. \"She is good looking, and would only have had to wait a few weeks.\" \n\nThey passed an open door, that of Morella's own chambers. Within it he stood and watched them go by. When they were opposite to him some doubt or idea seemed to strike his mind, for he looked at them keenly, stepped forward, then, thinking better of it, or perhaps remembering Betty's bitter tongue, halted and turned aside. That danger had gone by! \n\nAt length, none hindering them, they reached the yard where the escort and the horses waited. Here, standing under an archway, were Castell and Peter. Castell greeted Margaret in English and kissed her through her veil, while Peter, who had not seen her close since months before he rode away to Dedham, stared at her with all his eyes, and began to draw near to her, designing to find out, as he was sure he could do if once he touched her, whether indeed this were Margaret, or only Betty after all.

But Luis Moreno-Ocampo said the court did not know his whereabouts and would not reveal with whom the court is talking. \n\nSaif al-Islam Gadhafi has realized there is no escape, and wants to negotiate a surrender to limit the damage, said Anees al-Sharif, spokesman for the National Transitional Council's Tripoli Military Council. \n\nBut, he said, if the younger Gadhafi is captured in Libya, he will be tried there, as his alleged crimes were committed on Libyan soil. If he is captured outside Libya, the location of his trial will depend on where he is captured because of the ICC arrest warrants, he said. \n\nHowever, the NTC would prefer to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi in a Libyan court, as it would like to show that he could receive a fair trial, he said. \n\nMoreno-Ocampo said Friday that if Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is brought before the ICC, he will \"have all the rights and be protected,\" and will be allowed to present a defense. \n\n\"We believe we have a strong case,\" the prosecutor told CNN in an exclusive interview from The Hague. \"We believe he should be convicted.\" \n\nThe court believes Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, along with his father and his brother-in-law, Abdulla al-Sanussi, are responsible for crimes against humanity including murder and persecution across the country beginning in February amid anti-government demonstrations, Moreno-Ocampo said.

She cares about not only children's health but also their education. Before becoming a doctor, Chan taught science to the 4th and 5th graders at a school in California for a year.

She has a Chinese father and a Vietnamese mother. Her parents didn't come to the US with much. But they worked hard to make sure Chan and their other two daughters had the best opportunities possible. Chan went to Harvard University in 2003 and now works as a doctor. \"I realized that I was so lucky to be what I was,\" said Chan. \"It drives me to make sure others, no matter what background they have, can have their opportunities, to reach their dreams and their full potential .\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is she married to?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How much are they donating in US dollars?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "$3 billion.", "turn_id": 3, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "What grades did she teach?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What college did she attend?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What program did she start?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What nationality is her dad?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How many kids do they have?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What are their sexes?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is Chan's occupation?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How old is she?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 226, "span_end": 241, "span_text": "Mark Zuckerberg", "input_text": "Mark Zuckerberg", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 380, "span_end": 390, "span_text": "$3 billion", "input_text": "$3 billion", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 828, "span_text": "4th and 5th graders", "input_text": "4th and 5th graders", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1270, "span_end": 1277, "span_text": "Harvard", "input_text": "Harvard", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 906, "span_end": 924, "span_text": "The Primary School", "input_text": "The Primary School", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1066, "span_end": 1073, "span_text": "Chinese", "input_text": "Chinese", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 492, "span_end": 498, "span_text": "doctor", "input_text": "doctor", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 157, "span_end": 159, "span_text": "31", "input_text": "31", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "middle7800.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3mh9dq757wcawcp3atx6zpg583fgui", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/R M Ballantyne___The Red Man's Revenge.txt/CHAPTER TWENTY_4632ccce4f3fbec3b20ba2085cf7551c0463ccabe33c0a10e5b5d51", "story": "CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR. \n\nA SURPRISING DISCOVERY--AND MORE. \n\nWhen Ian Macdonald had seen his father's house fairly stranded on the knoll, and had made it fast there with innumerable ropes, thin and thick, as the Lilliputians secured Gulliver, he bethought him that it was high time to visit the Little Mountain, to which his father had gone on at that time, and inform him of the amazing fact. \n\nBefore setting off, however, common propriety required that he should look in at Willow Creek in passing, not only to let them know what had occurred, if they had not already observed it, but to ask if there was any message for Mr Ravenshaw. \n\nFirst releasing Peegwish, who now regarded him as a maniac, he embarked with him in the punt, and rowed over. \n\nIt was by that time approaching the afternoon.

In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. \n\nWith the exception of humans, who inhabit every continent, most primates live in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. They range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs only , to the eastern gorilla, weighing over ; that is, without taking into account the weight of particular human individuals, reaching up to . Based on fossil evidence, the earliest known true primates, represented by the genus \"Teilhardina\", date to 55.8 million years old. An early close primate relative known from abundant remains is the Late Paleocene \"Plesiadapis\", c. 55\u201358\u00a0million years old. Molecular clock studies suggest that the primate branch may be even older, originating near the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary or around 63\u201374\u00a0mya. \n\nThe order Primates was traditionally divided into two main groupings: prosimians and anthropoids (simians).

So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing. \n\nArtists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind. \n\nNo art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does.

Police believe Pardo planned to carry out a similar attack at Nord's house as he did at the shooting and house fire that claimed nine lives. \n\nAnother rented car that Pardo used to flee the scene was found booby-trapped after the shooting, police said.

He was a co-host of \"Crossfire\" on CNN with Robert Novak from 2002 to 2005. \n\nPaul Begala says he admired Robert Novak for his skepticism about authority, work ethic and faith in his beliefs. \n\n(CNN) -- In our innumerable debates, I delighted in calling Bob Novak \"the finest mind of the 12th century.\" One time, though, he scowled and growled, \"I prefer the 15th century. Spanish Inquisition. Those were the days.\" \n\nNovak left this world on Tuesday, but he also left his mark. Needless to say I disagreed with Bob about virtually every political issue, and sometimes our on-air debates continued as profanity-laced shouting matches after the show ended. Despite our profound differences, though, we were friends. Here's why: \n\nBob was an iconoclast. He loved poking conventional wisdom in the eye. If all the media elite were perched on the same wire, Bob would land on the opposite wire and gleefully squawk at them. \n\nBob was an ideologue more than a partisan. One of the many sources of tension between us was the fact that I am a partisan Democrat who believes that, from time to time, my personal ideological agenda must take a backseat to advancing a broader progressive agenda carried by my party.

GEORGE, Utah (CNN) -- A young man whose arranged marriage to a young cousin led to the conviction of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs was charged Wednesday with her rape. \n\nProsecutors filed the rape charge against Allen Steed, 26, a day after a jury found Jeffs guilty of two rape-accomplice counts in connection with Steed's ill-fated 2001 marriage to Elissa Wall. \n\nJurors found that Jeffs used his authority as leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, to push the girl into a marriage she did not want. \n\nSteed was 19 and his bride, who also was his first cousin, was 14 when Jeffs \"sealed\" them in spiritual marriage at a motel in Caliente, Nevada, where many FLDS weddings were performed. Three other couples also were married that day in separate ceremonies, according to testimony. \n\nSteed is accused of having sex with the girl against her will several weeks into the marriage. \n\nSteed testified for the defense at Jeffs' trial. He said his new wife was affectionate to him in private, but cold in public.

During that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and diamonds. In the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19\u201320th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech. \n\nElliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. \"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,\" he said. \n\nArmstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" and said: \"Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\" \n\nSpeaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was \"among the greatest of \n\nAmerican heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\". He added: \"And when Neil stepped on the \n\nmoon for the first time, it was a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\" \n\nBuzz Aldrin flew with Armstrong on Apollo 11. He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion. \n\n\"When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,\" he said. \"Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans \n\nhad ever been, we were not alone. Almost the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know many millions of people around the world will join me in mourning the death of a true \n\nAmerican hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will always be remembered as a historic moment in human history.\" \n\nIn the US, people felt that he represented the achievement of a past age of American greatness. Today, things are very different: NASA has cancelled a number of missions because they don't have enough money. \n\nFormer astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, said: \"Neil did something that people thought was impossible.\" Others complained about the state of the US. Journalist Andrew Pasternak wrote: \"It will take longer to rebuild lower Manhattan after 9/11 than it took to build an entire space program and send a man to the moon.\" \n\nOf course, NASA has its modern successes. Its engineers have landed a nuclear-powered robot on Mars. There will also be another Mars mission. It will drill below the planet's surface. But these achievements are not as exciting as Armstrong's. NASA administrator Charles Bolden expressed that in his tribute. \"As we enter this next era of space exploration, we are standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong,\" he said. \n\nArmstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become. Blogger Eric Berger saw an email from Armstrong and other former astronauts. It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: \"If you don't know where you are \n\ngoing, you might not get there.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Elliot Pulham?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Does he think NASA gets too much money?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What are his thoughts on this?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who is Neil Armstrong?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is he most known for?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What speech did he give?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is he still alive?", "turn_id": 8}], "answers": [{"span_start": 310, "span_end": 367, "span_text": "Elliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, t", "input_text": "A Chief Executive", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 340, "span_end": 429, "span_text": " of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, ", "input_text": "of the Space Foundation", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 366, "span_end": 429, "span_text": "thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 518, "span_end": 643, "span_text": "\"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,\" he said", "input_text": "\"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of\"", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 128, "span_text": "Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, has died at the age of 82.

The site provides an excerpt from each review and hyperlinks to its source. A color of Green, Yellow or Red summarizes the critics' recommendations. It has been described as the video game industry's \"premier\" review aggregator. \n\nMetacritic's scoring converts each review into a percentage, either mathematically from the mark given, or which the site decides subjectively from a qualitative review. Before being averaged, the scores are weighted according to the critic's fame, stature, and volume of reviews. \n\nMetacritic was launched in July 1999 by Marc Doyle, his sister Julie Doyle Roberts, and a classmate from the University of Southern California law school, Jason Dietz. Rotten Tomatoes was already compiling movie reviews, but Doyle, Roberts, and Dietz saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media. They sold Metacritic to CNET in 2005.

Although always hard pressed financially, their father encouraged his sons with their education. As a result, Burns not only read the Scottish poetry of Ramsay and the collections by Hailes and Herd, but also the works of Pope, Locke, and Shakespeare. \n\nBy 1781, Burns had tried his hand at several agricultural jobs without success. Although he had begun writing, and his poems were spread widely in manuscript , none were published until 1786, when Burns published Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786), which was an immediate success. Later Burns brought out a second edition of his poems at Edinburgh in 1787, and for two winters he was socially active in the Scottish city. In 1788 he retired to a farm at Ellis land. By 1791 Burns had failed as a farmer, and he moved to Dumfries, where he held a position as a tax collector. He died of illness at 37. \n\nBurns's art is at its best in songs such as My Heart's in the Highlands. Some of his songs, such as Auld Lang Syne and Comin' thro' the Rye, are among the most familiar and best-loved songs in the English language.

However, his three-month stay it the orphanage turned into in unusual experience. It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal. When he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children. The young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, \"I started walking with photos of the kids.\" he told the Reuters reporter. \"I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families.\" At the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture. Grennan said, \"Volunteering is the single best way to see how the rest of the world lives.\" He also encouraged others to do what he had done.

Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now also includes books and primary sources, and current issues of journals. It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. As of 2013, more than 8,000 institutions in more than 160 countries had access to JSTOR; most access is by subscription, but some older public domain content is freely available to anyone. JSTOR's revenue was $69 million in 2014. \n\nWilliam G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988, founded JSTOR. JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically. \n\nBowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution. However, Ira Fuchs, Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet.)

In addition to the alleged argument with Roy, the paper threw in Jay Z's supposed desire to head solo to a party being given by Rihanna. This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister. \n\nTalk show host Wendy Williams also offered her own observations, including what appears to be the removal of a tattoo on Beyonce's finger of the roman numeral \"IV.\" It was reportedly her wedding ring tattoo, meant to symbolize both her wedding date (April 4) as well as her and Jay Z's birthdays (September 4 and December 4, respectively). \n\nSo far, some of the principal characters seem to be letting Instagram speak for them.

One view holds that Malayalam and Modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of 'Proto-Dravidian' in the prehistoric era. \n\nThe earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet, and later the Kolezhuttu, which derived from it. The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords. With a total of 52 letters, the Malayalam script has the largest number of letters among the Indian language orthographies. The oldest literary work in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated from between the 9th and 11th centuries. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam \"Varthamanappusthakam\", written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is the origin of Malayalam clear?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was the earliest writing?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was there another script after that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was that?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many letters does the current one contain?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many views on origin are given?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is Malayalam?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where is it used?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it spoken mostly in one place?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many languages are in India?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When was it classified as a classical language?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many speak it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What group of languages does it fall under?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Does it ever serve as a link language?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 843, "span_end": 894, "span_text": "The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1140, "span_end": 1211, "span_text": "The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet", "input_text": "the Vatteluttu alphabet", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1213, "span_end": 1237, "span_text": "and later the Kolezhuttu", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1213, "span_end": 1237, "span_text": "and later the Kolezhuttu", "input_text": "the Kolezhuttu", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1404, "span_end": 1430, "span_text": "With a total of 52 letters", "input_text": "52 letters", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1027, "span_end": 1041, "span_text": "A second view ", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 33, "span_text": "Malayalam is a Dravidian language", "input_text": "a Dravidian language", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 50, "span_text": "Malayalam is a Dravidian language spoken in India,", "input_text": "in India", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 51, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "predominantly in the state of Kerala", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 51, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "predominantly in the state of Kerala", "input_text": "the state of Kerala", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India", "input_text": "22", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 146, "span_end": 197, "span_text": "designated as a Classical Language in India in 2013", "input_text": "in 2013", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 488, "span_end": 527, "span_text": "and is spoken by some 38 million people", "input_text": "38 million people", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 440, "span_end": 487, "span_text": "It belongs to the Dravidian family of languages", "input_text": "the Dravidian family", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 750, "span_end": 775, "span_text": "serves as a link language", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "Malayalam.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3ggai1sqevye2s4pz5a1ioewwbvmc4", "filename": "cnn_0233120a6a9102f49d4784014bd6343b2922b900.story", "story": "(CNN) -- Even a presidential campaign's airplane troubles can get partisan in an election year. \n\nAviation incidents involving President Barack Obama and Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have inspired hundreds of supporters commenting at CNN.com to connect those events to the candidates' political positions. \n\nWhen the Air Force One pilot aborted his first landing in Toledo, Ohio, due to weather on Wednesday, commenters were quick to jump on Obama. \n\n\"See, Barack Obama can't even land a plane correctly,\" wrote a commenter whose handle is TheOtherBob. \"He was probably checking the polls - thinks he has Ohio in the bag - no need to land,\" wrote another commenter. \n\n\"He was distracted, since he was busy adjusting gas prices over his smart phone,\" wrote another commenter. \n\nAnn Romney's smoke-filled plane \n\nAnn Romney couldn't catch a break, either.

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. \n\nWhat Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . \n\nFor years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \n\n\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. \n\nLike most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. \n\nBesides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet.

The -isomer, -glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the -isomer, -glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar, cane sugar, maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. It is commonly commercially manufactured from cornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization. In 1747, Andreas Marggraf was the first to isolate glucose. Glucose is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.

The city is at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country. Being in the centre of the Balkan peninsula, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea. \n\nSofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. Being Bulgaria's primate city, Sofia is a hometown of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. Sofia is one of the top 10 best places for start-up business in the world, especially in information technologies. Sofia is Europe's most affordable capital to visit . \n\nFor the longest time the city possessed a Thracian name, derived from the tribe \"Serdi\", who were either of Thracian, Celtic, or mixed Thracian-Celtic origin. The Serdi and the name of emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53 \u2013 117 AD) prompted the Romans to give the city the combinative name of \"Ulpia Serdica\"; Ulpia is derived from an Umbrian cognate of the Latin word \"lupus\", meaning \"wolf.\" It seems that the first written mention of \"Serdica\" was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0438, \"Sardaki\"). During the Romans \"civitas Serdenisium\" was mentioned the \"brightest city of the Serdi\" in official inscriptions. The city was major throughout the past ever since Antiquity, when Roman emperor Constantine the Great referred to it as \"my Rome\", and it nearly became his capital.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the capital of Bulgaria?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it a small  city?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How manyh people live in the city?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "And in the metro area?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What mountain is it at the base of?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many seas is it near?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "which one is it closest to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is one other sea nearby?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "and the other?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how long have people been living there?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "does it have universities?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How does it rank regarding start ups?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "in the country?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What kind of name did it have?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "where did that name came from?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "who was the emperor?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What name did the  Romans give to the city?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does  lupus mean?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "When was he last mention of the name?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what did Constantine called it?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 6, "span_text": "Sofia ", "input_text": "Sofia", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 43, "span_end": 50, "span_text": "largest", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 69, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "1.26 million", "input_text": "1.26 million", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 110, "span_end": 122, "span_text": "1.68 million", "input_text": "1.68 million", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 188, "span_end": 204, "span_text": "Vitosha Mountain", "input_text": "Vitosha Mountain", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 375, "span_text": "Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea. \n", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 362, "span_end": 372, "span_text": "Aegean Sea", "input_text": "Aegean Sea", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 320, "span_text": "Black Sea", "input_text": "Black Sea", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 329, "span_end": 341, "span_text": "Adriatic Sea", "input_text": "Adriatic Sea", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 419, "span_end": 441, "span_text": "since at least 7000 BC", "input_text": "since at least 7000 BC", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 485, "span_end": 534, "span_text": "hometown of many of the major local universities,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 592, "span_end": 621, "span_text": "one of the top 10 best places", "input_text": "one of the top 10 best places", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 644, "span_end": 656, "span_text": "in the world", "input_text": "in the world", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 795, "span_end": 803, "span_text": "Thracian", "input_text": "Thracian", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 818, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "from the tribe \"Serdi\"", "input_text": "from the tribe \"Serdi\"", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1506, "span_end": 1527, "span_text": "Constantine the Great", "input_text": "Constantine the Great", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1045, "span_end": 1058, "span_text": "Ulpia Serdica", "input_text": "Ulpia Serdica", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1138, "span_end": 1142, "span_text": "wolf", "input_text": "wolf", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1256, "span_end": 1268, "span_text": "19th century", "input_text": "19th century", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1547, "span_end": 1554, "span_text": "my Rome", "input_text": "my Rome", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Sofia.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3ruiqrxjbbonzegac62llupuro5llm", "filename": "cnn_7f1928656f6354b9cbfc16c684fc7a4ebda61fee.story", "story": "(CNN) -- In 1984, in the midst of Lebanon's civil war, Naji Gebran started hosting regular gatherings at his Beirut beachfront apartment for the purpose of \"musical therapy.\" \n\nWeary and traumatized from the conflict that had divided their city -- and would claim some 150,000 lives over its 15 years -- people would come to his apartment to lose themselves in a night of jazz, blues, funk, soul, classical and Arabic music. \n\n\"They used to come because of the music, to forget the war,\" said Gebran. \"We used to do this for peace.\" \n\nThe party nights were an important outlet, he said, as during the war years there were few other options. \n\n\"My friends had nowhere to go,\" he said.

Then Harding got news from his agent that necessitated his return to Winnipeg, and Mrs. Mowbray and Beatrice, who wished to visit the millinery stores, arranged to accompany him. \n\nIt was hot and dry when they reached the city, but Harding was of sanguine temperament and, being relieved from fear of immediate disaster, proceeded with his plans for the consolidation of Allenwood. He could not carry them far, because even if he secured an abundant harvest, which was at present doubtful, he would have some difficulty in raising capital enough to outbid his rival. Acting cautiously with Jackson's help, however, he found two men who had lent Davies money and were now frankly alarmed by the general fall in values.

Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on the UEFA club rankings. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Cl\u00e1sico. \n\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club. On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane.

The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the church, and paved the way for the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment. \n\nFrancis Hutcheson, a moral philosopher, described the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, \"the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers\".

Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . \n\nMary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. \n\nMary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. \n\nJoey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. \n\nThe story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale.

The device went on sale in North America on November 21, 2004. The DS, short for \"Developers' System\" or \"Dual Screen\", introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one featuring a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity. Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-closed Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony's PlayStation Portable as part of the seventh generation era. It was likened to the Nintendo 64 from the 1990s, which led to several N64 ports such as \"Super Mario 64 DS\", \"Diddy Kong Racing DS\", among others. \n\nPrior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental, \"third pillar\" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series. On March 2, 2006, Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi, another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features.

But is today's American Dream a mythical concept or still a reality? \n\nIsabel Belarsky's tiny Brooklyn apartment fills with the sound of her father's voice. Sidor Belarsky sings an Aria in Russian and 90-year-old Isabel, her lips painted an elegant red, sways gently to the song coming from her stereo. \n\nIsabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer: Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience. \n\nHow the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" \n\nLike generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" \n\nThe American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". \n\nThe concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution. \n\nBut somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well. \n\nIn the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. \n\nCheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \n\n\"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious.

Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple \"faculties\" (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution. It was also home to many other educational innovations. The first school of medicine in North America (Perelman School of Medicine, 1765), the first collegiate business school (Wharton School of Business, 1881) and the first \"student union\" building and organization (Houston Hall, 1896) were founded at Penn. With an endowment of $10.72 billion (2016), Penn had the seventh largest endowment of all colleges in the United States. All of Penn's schools exhibit very high research activity. In fiscal year 2015, Penn's academic research budget was $851 million, involving more than 4,300 faculty, 1,100 postdoctoral fellows and 5,500 support staff/graduate assistants.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who founded U of Penn?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was his curriculum ever adopted?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is U of Penn a public or private school?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is it Ivy League?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "In what city is it located?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many founding members were in the Association of American Universities?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Was U of Penn one of them?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Before what historical event was the school chartered?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did Franklin's proposed curriculum included the study of what kind of service?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was the school of Medicine named?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When was it founded?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was the business school called?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What year was it established?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was the building founded in 1896?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "It was the first what?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is the amount of the school's endowment?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What year is this data from?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How does that endowment rank in the US?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Does Penn have a great deal of research going on?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How much money is in their research budget?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 388, "span_end": 422, "span_text": "Benjamin Franklin, Penn's founder,", "input_text": "Benjamin Franklin", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 565, "span_end": 613, "span_text": "though his proposed curriculum was never adopted", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 65, "span_end": 88, "span_text": "is a private Ivy League", "input_text": "private?", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 64, "span_end": 88, "span_text": " is a private Ivy League", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 109, "span_end": 146, "span_text": "located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "input_text": "Philadelphia", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 228, "span_end": 305, "span_text": "enn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities", "input_text": "14", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 227, "span_end": 306, "span_text": "Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 309, "span_end": 386, "span_text": " one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.

It is on the eastern end of Lake Ontario, at the beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River (south end of the Rideau Canal). The city is midway between Toronto and Montreal. The Thousand Islands tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"\"Limestone City\"\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone. \n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\" in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later Fort Frontenac, became a focus for settlement. After the British conquered New France, the village was renamed Kingston. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the Province of Canada on February 10, 1841. While its time as a political centre was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important military installation. Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998. Kingston is now a separated municipality from the County of Frontenac. \n\nA number of origins of \"Cataraqui\", Kingston's original name, have been postulated. One is it is derived from the Iroquois word that means \"the place where one hides\". The name may also be derivations of Native words that mean \"impregnable\", \"muddy river\", \"place of retreat\", \"clay bank rising out of the water\" or \"where the rivers and lake meet\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "What country is Kingston in?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was it named the first capital?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was it a long-standing political epicenter for the nation?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did its political importance end?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What importance does it serve now?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is Kingston's original name?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is one possible meaning of that word?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Derived from which tribe?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is another possible translation?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do any of the names have to do with water?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Which?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Which rivers is Kingston located near?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "And which major lake?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is Kingston's nickname?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Which major cities is it in the middle of?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is there a tourist destination nearby?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Named?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was known as Cataraqui in 1673?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When was it renamed Kingston?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 45, "span_text": "Kingston is a city in eastern Ontario, Canada", "input_text": "Canada", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 862, "span_end": 945, "span_text": "Kingston was named the first capital of the Province of Canada on February 10, 1841", "input_text": "February 10, 1841", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 1010, "span_text": " While its time as a political centre was short (ending in 1844)", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 977, "span_end": 1010, "span_text": "centre was short (ending in 1844)", "input_text": "in 1844", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1012, "span_end": 1073, "span_text": "the community has remained an important military installation", "input_text": "the community has remained an important military installation", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1209, "span_end": 1269, "span_text": "A number of origins of \"Cataraqui\", Kingston's original name", "input_text": "Cataraqui", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1331, "span_end": 1376, "span_text": " word that means \"the place where one hides\".", "input_text": "\"the place where one hides\".", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1293, "span_end": 1332, "span_text": "One is it is derived from the Iroquois ", "input_text": "from the Iroquois", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1465, "span_end": 1484, "span_text": " \"place of retreat\"", "input_text": "\"place of retreat\"", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1525, "span_end": 1558, "span_text": "\"where the rivers and lake meet\".", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1450, "span_end": 1558, "span_text": " \"muddy river\", \"place of retreat\", \"clay bank rising out of the water\" or \"where the rivers and lake meet\".", "input_text": "\"muddy river\", \"clay bank rising out of the water\" or \"where the rivers and lake meet\".", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 96, "span_end": 172, "span_text": "beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River ", "input_text": "the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 60, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "eastern end of Lake Ontario", "input_text": "Lake Ontario", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 321, "span_end": 357, "span_text": " is nicknamed the \"\"Limestone City\"\"", "input_text": "\"\"Limestone City\"\"", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 358, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone.

He set up a website where he could write down all his good deeds, like helping the neighbor take out the rubbish or spending a few hours in helping a disabled lady pick out a dress for a party. \"I've never thought of any return from helping others.Actually, it has given me happiness and I have become more thankful and grateful for the things I have now.\" Luke said.He has decided to continue doing good deeds in 2015. Luke won the competition for the job of National Philanthropy Manager because of his kind deeds.He will travel all over the UK and help 45 different charities in 2015. \"I used to work as a part-time worker in a shop.Now I become the National Philanthropy Manager.\" Luke said, \"I think I've helped myself by helping others.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where is Luke Cameron from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did he decide to do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When did that start?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was something he did?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was that the first thing?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did he do the next day?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How does he feel now that he has started doing this?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What else has it done for him?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he decide to continue the next year?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did he win as a result of his acts?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "For what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where will he go?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What will he do?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is Luke an older person?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What was his job before he won this one?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How did he keep up with all of his acts of kindness", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What did he write there?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did he want in return?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who did he help pick out a dress?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "A young British man called Luke Cameron", "input_text": "Britain", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 40, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "has done a good deed every day", "input_text": "do a good deed every day", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 140, "span_end": 185, "span_text": "Luke made a decision at the beginning of 2014", "input_text": "at the beginning of 2014", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 280, "span_end": 311, "span_text": "he greeted the waiter at a cafe", "input_text": "he greeted the waiter at a cafe", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 267, "span_end": 329, "span_text": "For example, he greeted the waiter at a cafe on New Year's Day", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 334, "span_end": 396, "span_text": "he bought food and drink for some homeless people the next day", "input_text": "he bought food and drink for some homeless people", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 646, "span_end": 681, "span_text": "Actually, it has given me happiness", "input_text": "it has given him happiness", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 682, "span_end": 713, "span_text": "and I have become more thankful", "input_text": "he has become more thankful", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 765, "span_end": 816, "span_text": "He has decided to continue doing good deeds in 2015", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 818, "span_end": 887, "span_text": "Luke won the competition for the job of National Philanthropy Manager", "input_text": "a competition", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 818, "span_end": 887, "span_text": "Luke won the competition for the job of National Philanthropy Manager", "input_text": "for the job of National Philanthropy Manager", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 914, "span_end": 945, "span_text": "He will travel all over the UK ", "input_text": "all over the UK", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 945, "span_end": 976, "span_text": "and help 45 different charities", "input_text": "help different charities", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "A young British man called Luke Cameron", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 987, "span_end": 1023, "span_text": "I used to work as a part-time worker", "input_text": "a part-time worker", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1004, "span_end": 1033, "span_text": " a part-time worker in a shop", "input_text": "in a shop", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 398, "span_end": 462, "span_text": "He set up a website where he could write down all his good deeds", "input_text": "a website", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 398, "span_end": 462, "span_text": "He set up a website where he could write down all his good deeds", "input_text": "all his good deeds", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 593, "span_end": 625, "span_text": "I've never thought of any return", "input_text": "nothing", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 538, "span_end": 579, "span_text": "helping a disabled lady pick out a dress ", "input_text": "a disabled lady", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle5532.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "333u7hk6i9fy6c4iw4skm24xenadj2", "filename": "high21861.txt", "story": "People in the United States love baseball.

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyonc\u00e9's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". \n\nFollowing the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\", and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyonc\u00e9 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyonc\u00e9 took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul.

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.4 million. \n\nThe area's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia.

It is, to be sure, a self-inflicted wound, a measure of some organizational chaos. But it is also a function of illogically restrictive local laws. They not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the Oval Office. \n\nThe United States is the only nation in the world, save Switzerland, that does not have uniform federal ballot access laws, according to Ballot Access News, a website run by Richard Winger that is dedicated to the issue. This may reflect the country's closely held federalism, but it can create chaos in a presidential year. In many cases, the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates. \n\nTake, for example, my home state of New York. It votes reliably Democratic in presidential years, at least since Ronald Reagan thrashed Walter Mondale in 1984. But the state's primary delegates can still be a prize in a protracted Republican nomination fight. In 1999, John McCain had to sue to even have his name appear on the ballot alongside George W. Bush because the Republican state party chair and his committee essentially decided that Bush would be their nominee without the inconvenience of putting it to a vote. Local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end-run around democracy.

And in \"A Clockwork Orange,\" Anthony Burgess imagined a world in which ultraviolent teens rampaged in a distinctive English-Russian patois that defined their alienation from society and authority. \n\nNow in the 21st century, there is Colbert's \"truthiness\" -- political half-truths, quarter-truths and what the website Politifact describes as \"Pants-on-Fire\" prevarications. \n\nOn his Comedy Central show, \"The Colbert Report,\" he introduced \"The Word,\" a regular deconstruction of language contortion designed, in Orwell's notion, to defend the indefensible. (One example: \"A Perfect World,\" as in, journalists should demand to investigate torture, but it's not a perfect world.) \n\nIt's sharp political humor and a canny critique of American culture, language and iconography. And it's helped the comic emerge as this nation's court jester, licensed by the youthful cable TV audience to speak truth to power. \n\nSuch is Colbert's power and influence that he has been invited to testify before Congress today on the issue of illegal immigration -- and to testify in character. It's as if the Congress of the Eisenhower years invited Harpo Marx to offer testimony by beeping his bicycle horn. \n\nColbert has long been on to something important about the nature of our political discourse at the beginning of a new postmodern millennium: that ideology has become the lens through which Americans found their particular truth, let the evidence be damned.

Moving into politics, before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of Asquith's Liberal government. During the war, Churchill departed from government following the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign. He briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander in the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He returned to government under Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, then Secretary of State for the Colonies. After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Baldwin's Conservative government of 1924\u20131929, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what kind of family did Churchill grow up in?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what did his parents do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "where was he a commander?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "where was he the Chancellor?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how long was he prime minister?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "did he lead Britain to victory?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what war?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what party was he a member of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "when did he start politics?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "when did he leave the government?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 485, "span_end": 507, "span_text": "an aristocratic family", "input_text": "an aristocratic family", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 523, "span_end": 564, "span_text": "English politician and American socialite", "input_text": "English politician and American socialite", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1106, "span_end": 1128, "span_text": "Royal Scots Fusiliers.", "input_text": "Royal Scots Fusiliers.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1364, "span_end": 1373, "span_text": "Exchequer", "input_text": "Exchequer", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 178, "span_end": 221, "span_text": " 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955.

It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past. \n\nHumans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in pre-historic times. Observations on tides were recorded by Aristotle and Strabo. Early exploration of the oceans was primarily for cartography and mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in nets, though depth soundings by lead line were taken. \n\nAlthough Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n in 1513 first identified the Gulf Stream, and the current was well-known to mariners, Benjamin Franklin made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name. Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause. Franklin and Timothy Folger printed the first map of the Gulf Stream in 1769-1770. Information on the currents of the Pacific Ocean was gathered by explorers of the late 18th century, including James Cook and Louis Antoine de Bougainville. James Rennell wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography, detailing the current flows of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. During a voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1777, he mapped \"\"the banks and currents at the Lagullas\"\". He was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near the Isles of Scilly, (now known as Rennell's Current).", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who named the Gulf Stream?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who first pointed it out?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Were it's currents famous to sailors?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did Franklin measure there?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "More than once?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What we he doing there?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he measurements create an accurate explanation?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did humans figure out currents of the ocean?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who kept track of tides?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "In early days of mapping, was it primarily what they could see or below the water?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Since early mapping was above the surface, how did they measure depth of the water?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Are multiple disciplines included in oceanography?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1301, "span_end": 1378, "span_text": "Benjamin Franklin made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name.", "input_text": "Benjamin Franklin", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1187, "span_end": 1300, "span_text": "Although Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n in 1513 first identified the Gulf Stream, and the current was well-known to mariners,", "input_text": "Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1241, "span_end": 1299, "span_text": "he Gulf Stream, and the current was well-known to mariners", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1378, "span_end": 1415, "span_text": " Franklin measured water temperatures", "input_text": "water temperatures", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1379, "span_end": 1449, "span_text": "Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1378, "span_end": 1497, "span_text": " Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause", "input_text": "crossing the Atlantic", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1379, "span_end": 1499, "span_text": "Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause.

The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density. \n\nThe county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era. The Romans conquered Dorset's indigenous Celtic tribe, and during the early Middle Ages, the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century. The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century, and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348. Dorset has seen much civil unrest: in the English Civil War, an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement. During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy, and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points. The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics, and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing, Cornish pilot gig rowing, sea kayaking and powerboating.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is Dorset's archaically named?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was the reorganization of the local government?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What type of county is it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "It has a long history of what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Has it seen a lot of civil unrest?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In what world war it was involved in?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where does half of its population live?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Why was its border extended eastward?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What occurred there in the 8th century?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What's to the west of Dorset?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 11, "span_end": 35, "span_text": "archaically, Dorsetshire", "input_text": "Dorsetshire", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 467, "span_end": 509, "span_text": "reorganisation of local government in 1974", "input_text": "1974", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 101, "span_end": 122, "span_text": "The ceremonial county", "input_text": "ceremonial", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 783, "span_end": 822, "span_text": " has a long history of human settlement", "input_text": "human settlement", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1182, "span_end": 1217, "span_text": " Dorset has seen much civil unrest:", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1508, "span_end": 1535, "span_text": "During the Second World War", "input_text": "the Second World War", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 620, "span_end": 692, "span_text": "Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation", "input_text": "in the South East Dorset conurbation", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 510, "span_end": 619, "span_text": "the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch.", "input_text": "to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 949, "span_end": 1001, "span_text": " the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire", "input_text": "the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 301, "span_end": 319, "span_text": "Devon to the west,", "input_text": "Devon", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Dorset.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3483fv8beejzf7rvfweehf8oum7269", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Baronness Orczy___El Dorado.txt/CHAPTER XXIII_8ff5da6344fb096aebf85a4e1eb1a09bf2c2a74bf5abe926a2eaa54", "story": "CHAPTER XXIII. THE OVERWHELMING ODDS \n\nAt half-past ten that same evening, Blakeney, still clad in a workman's tattered clothes, his feet bare so that he could tread the streets unheard, turned into the Rue de la Croix Blanche. \n\nThe porte-cochere of the house where Armand lodged had been left on the latch; not a soul was in sight. Peering cautiously round, he slipped into the house. On the ledge of the window, immediately on his left when he entered, a candle was left burning, and beside it there was a scrap of paper with the initials S. P. roughly traced in pencil. No one challenged him as he noiselessly glided past it, and up the narrow stairs that led to the upper floor. Here, too, on the second landing the door on the right had been left on the latch. He pushed it open and entered. \n\nAs is usual even in the meanest lodgings in Paris houses, a small antechamber gave between the front door and the main room. When Percy entered the antechamber was unlighted, but the door into the inner room beyond was ajar. Blakeney approached it with noiseless tread, and gently pushed it open. \n\nThat very instant he knew that the game was up; he heard the footsteps closing up behind him, saw Armand, deathly pale, leaning against the wall in the room in front of him, and Chauvelin and Heron standing guard over him. \n\nThe next moment the room and the antechamber were literally alive with soldiers--twenty of them to arrest one man.

It had been a desperate onset, in which mortification increased natural intrepidity, which had been nobly resisted, but in which numbers had necessarily prevailed.

His boat had first touched the rock, her crew had first reached the ruin, and, of all in her, he himself had taken the lead. Desperately had he contended for Jane and a commission, and this time Providence appeared to smile on his efforts.

The growth of the warmer attachment she had expected to feel was strangely slow, and though it was early to indulge in regrets her heart sometimes grew heavy as she looked forward to the future.

Besides, she was anxious about him; he looked worn, his manner suggested that he was bearing a strain, but this was in his favor, for it roused her compassion.

Nashville's gruffest and grittiest star turns out to be its most reliable traditionalist, a Music Row pro who can write a song for every emotional season. Johnson pulled out a whole slew of them -- 25, clocking in north of 105 minutes -- for his double-disc fourth album: acoustic confessions and rugged boogie blues, big weepers and grim reapers, cover tunes and novelty ditties, not to mention \"California Riots\" and \"Playing the Part,\" a pair of fiercely funny, unrepentantly redneck swipes at the frou-frou blue states. \n\n4. Arcade Fire, \"The Suburbs\" Arcade Fire don't do anything small -- so leave it to the Montreal collective to make an album of vast, orchestral rock that locates the battle for the human soul amid big houses and manicured lawns. \n\n\"The Suburbs\" is the band's most adventurous album yet: See the psychotic speed strings on \"Empty Room,\" the Crazy Horse rush of \"Month of May,\" the synth-pop disco of \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains).\" Win Butler and his wife, R\u00e9gine Chassagne, sing about suburban boredom, fear of change and wanting to have a kid of their own -- always scaling their intimate confessions to arena-rock levels and finding beauty wherever they look. \n\n3.

Producer T Bone Burnett delivers his most spectacular production in memory, filled with shining steel guitar, chortling brass and gospel-time choirs.

Indeed, it said a great deal for Winifred that after all this time with Dartie she remained well-founded.

All his achievements were, however, poured forth by himself and Clarence to Emily and me, and we felt as proud of them as if they had been our own. \n\nClarence was industrious, and did not fail in his school work, but when he came home for the holidays there was a cowed look about him, and private revelations were made over my sofa that made my flesh creep. The scars were still visible, caused by having been compelled to grasp the bars of the grate bare-handed; and, what was worse, he had been suspended outside a third story window by the wrists, held by a schoolfellow of thirteen! \n\n'But what was Griff about?'

Just in a few hundred meters, she would have been safe in her house. \n\nIt was really getting dark now. She wished she had her favorite coat on. It might keep her really warm. She imagined having it with her. This thought dissipated when she finally saw her front door. It seemed different. Nobody had taken care of the outside garden for a few days. She was shocked: her father was usually so strict about keeping everything clean and tidy, and now... \n\nShe entered the house. First, she went into the kitchen and saw a note written by her father, \"Dear Ellen, there's some coffee ready; I went looking.\" But where was Ellen? On the right side of the hallway was her parents' room. She went in and saw her. Her mother, lying on the bed, was sleeping. Her face looked so tired, as if she hadn't slept for days.

Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science and biology. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers. \n\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\", co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty. \n\nThis theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. Game theory was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. With the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole in 2014, eleven game-theorists have now won the economics Nobel Prize.

Unlike the first three (Rashidun) caliphs, Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad, Banu Hashim, and Shia Muslims consider him legitimate by favour of his blood ties to Muhammad.

However, he died a poor man after a life that was once described as \" _ \". So, what went wrong? \n\nAs a young boy, Jack went to Westminster School, but after only one year he was expelled for fighting with a teacher. He was then sent to Harrow School but only lasted three days before he was also thrown out. He was eventually educated by private tutors. \n\nAfter school, Jack went to Cambridge University. He arrived with 2,000 bottles of port, but left without graduating - he found university life boring. Later, he joined the army, enlisting with the 7th Hussars. As a young officer, he spent a year with the regiment in France as part of the occupation force after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. Jack passed the time gambling and drinking before resigning his commission. At the age of 21, he returned to his country house just in time to receive his inheritance. \n\nWith an annual income of over PS800,000 in today's money, Jack was extremely rich... but it didn't take him long to spend it all. In 1819, he became an MP. In order to secure his seat, he offered voters PS10 notes to vote for him, spending more than PS10,000 in total. However, he found politics dull and went to parliament only once. Back at home, he would often drop bank notes in the gardens of his estate, and gave his servants vast amounts of spending money. Once he lost his racetrack winnings (several thousand pounds) when the wind blew all the money away. \n\nOne of Jack's favorite pastimes was hunting. He would go in any kind of weather, occasionally with no clothes on. Sometimes, he would get up in the middle of the night, take off with a gun to look for something to shoot. \n\nJack also kept a large number of pets. These included about 2,000 dogs. Some were fed on steak and Champagne and even wore livery. A favorite horse had free range inside Halston Hall and would often lie with Jack in front of the fire. \n\nJack was a bit of a practical joker, too. He once left a horse in the bedroom of a guest. Another visitor fell asleep and woke up to find a live bear and two bulldogs in his bed. In 1826, as a result of a bet, Jack rode his horse into the Bedford Hotel, up the grand staircase and onto the balcony. Then, still sitting on the horse, he jumped off the balcony, landing among the diners in the restaurant below. \n\nAnother time, he invited a local doctor to dine at Halston Hall. As soon as the doctor had left, Jack put on a highwayman's costume and raced ahead to rob the unsuspecting man. On another occasion, a passenger in Jack's carriage admitted that he'd never been in an accident, so Jack drove the carriage up a hill and turned it over. He would also slip red-hot coals into people's pockets as a joke. \n\nEventually, Jack ran out of money and fell into debt. In 1830, he fled to France to avoid his creditors , but returned a couple of years later, ending up in prison in Southwark, London. Jack died there in 1834, a poor, lonely man.

He breaks down the key questions ahead of Tuesday's election. \n\nWhy is it happening now? \n\nThe government says Syria's new constitution stipulates that presidential elections must be held now. The regime says it shows the country is moving forward and that it is the first time a president will be elected by the people rather than appointed. The opposition says the election is a fraud, that voting will be rigged and that the poll serves only to cement Assad's power. \n\nWho are the other candidates? \n\nThe other two candidates are relative unknowns. One is Maher Hajjar, an entrepreneur and member of parliament. He keeps out of the limelight and has not been heard from much. Hajjar's election posters declare that \"Syria is with Palestine,\" which seems like a very narrow slogan. Other than that it is unclear what he would change should he win. \n\nThe more intriguing candidate is Hassan Nouri, a former economics professor and cabinet minister who told me he had to resign because he was too critical of Assad's government. Nouri studied at the University of Wisconsin and still refers to himself as a Badger. He says the election is an uphill battle for him, but feels he is making headway. His main message is economic. He is for market liberalization and fighting corruption in government and in the private sector. But when it comes to fighting Syria's civil war, Nouri says he wouldn't do anything differently -- and much like Assad, he refers to the regime's three-year assault on the opposition as \"fighting terrorism.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many people have died?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who is expected to win the election?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does the constitution stipulate?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does the regime say about it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does the opposition say?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did they say anything else?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who is Maher Hajjer?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What do he do for a living?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is he well known?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Does he have an election slogan?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What does he plan to change besides that?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is there another candidate running?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What is his name?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is his profession?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Why is he a former economics professor and cabinet minister?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where did he get his education?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How does he feel about the election?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What is his main message?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "What are his economic views?", "turn_id": 21}], "answers": [{"span_start": 415, "span_end": 476, "span_text": "the conflict, which has left an estimated 150,000 people dead", "input_text": "150,000", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 254, "span_end": 308, "span_text": " expected to return President Bashar al-Assad to power", "input_text": "President Bashar al-Assad", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 601, "span_end": 670, "span_text": "constitution stipulates that presidential elections must be held now.", "input_text": "that presidential elections must be held now.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 670, "span_end": 819, "span_text": " The regime says it shows the country is moving forward and that it is the first time a president will be elected by the people rather than appointed", "input_text": "it is the first time a president will be elected by the people rather than appointed", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 821, "span_end": 865, "span_text": "The opposition says the election is a fraud,", "input_text": "the election is a fraud", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 866, "span_end": 948, "span_text": "that voting will be rigged and that the poll serves only to cement Assad's power.

It is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime, growth and nature. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. \n\nIn surveys made in Europe and the United States, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and envy. In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What makes the emerald green?", "turn_id": 1},

mother of the 13-year-old Dutch girl Laura Dekker, whose plans to make a solo sailing trip around the world have recently made world headlines, has spoken out against the trip. \"It breaks my heart to think that because of this I could lose contact with my daughter,\" she said in an interview. \"I have never before made such a difficult decision. But I must accept the consequences. I would rather have a live daughter who I will never see again than a dead daughter.\" \n\nIt is the first time that Laura's mother, Babs Muller, has spoken out against the trip. Laura's parents are divorced and the girl has lived with her father since she was six. Her father Dick Dekker supports Laura's plans. However, the Dutch Child Protection Board has decided to place the girl under supervision for two months to ascertain whether she is mentally and physically capable of undertaking the journey. \n\nMs Muller says she is confident that Laura is technically capable of making the journey. \"She can sail like the devil.

The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun. \n\nThe 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations? \n\nObama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\" \n\nRecent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963. \n\n\n\nHowever, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities. \n\nAlthough blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities. \n\nIt is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\" \n\nIn the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US. \n\n\"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens.

Because a full rotation equals 2 radians, one degree is equivalent to radians. \n\nThe original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown. One theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year. Ancient astronomers noticed that the sun, which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year, seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day. Some ancient calendars, such as the Persian calendar, used 360 days for a year. The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers. \n\nAnother theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system. The earliest trigonometry, used by the Babylonian astronomers and their Greek successors, was based on chords of a circle. A chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity.

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \"Buenos aires\" can be translated as \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. \n\nThe city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.

Four days later Ann was still looking after the dog, whom they had started to call Riley. When she arrived home from work, the dog threw itself against the screen door and barked madly at her. As soon as she opened the door, Riley dashed into the boys' room where Ann found Jack suffering from a heart attack. Riley ran over to Jack, but as soon as Ann bent over to help him the dog went silent. \"If it hadn't come to get me, the doctor said Jack would have died,\" Ann reported to a local newspaper.

He says organizations almost always use new, creative technology only to continue what they already do. \n\nNew technology should change organizations, he says, and disrupt them in a good way. They should use the technology to do things differently--for example, to serve more needs. The book says the needed disruptive force in education is computer-based learning. \n\nMichael Horn, another author of \"Disrupting Class\", told us about a Bostonpublic that he visited. Every student at Lilla G. Frederick Middle School inDorchester,Massachusetts, has a laptop computer. One class was learning about storms. Michael Horn says the laptops made it possible to truly individualize the lessons, to divide materials by ability level and learning style. At the end of the class, the students all took part in a discussion led by the teacher. \n\nComputer-based learning offers a way for students to take advanced courses not offered at their school, or to retake classes they failed. It also serves those who cannot physically attend school, and students who receive home schooling. \n\nComputer-based learning includes online courses. Enrollments in online courses have grown sharply. In 2007, the United Stateshad about one million enrollments, not including college courses. Students could be enrolled in more than one course, through schools or education companies. High school students make up about seventy percent of the enrollment. Still, nationally, only about one percent of all high school courses last year were taught online. \n\nBut the authors of \"Disrupting Class\"predict it will be ten percent in about six years. And their research suggests that the number will be about fifty percent by 2019.

It can feel all too fleeting. \n\nBut in Ohio, in recent years, there has been an effort to do more. \n\nWhich is why the Ohio General Assembly authorized that a stretch of State Route 2 in Lorain County -- David Hall's home county -- be named, now and forever, to honor him. \n\n\"After the General Assembly votes to name a portion of a highway, we manufacture the signs and put them up at the designated places,\" said Steve Faulkner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation.

There is no organized outreach sanctioned by him.\" \n\nSeveral donors told CNN that that in private sessions, Bush has not given any more indication than he has publicly about his intentions.

I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. \n\nWhenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. \n\nI was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \" a Northern man with Southern principles,\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. \n\nAnd this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\" \n\nWith this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. \n\nMy father was greatly troubled by this violent behavior. As little Sam picked himself up, my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library. He appeared strangely puzzled on learning the nature of my objections to going North. \n\n\"Who on earth, Tom, has filled your brain with those silly stories?\" asked my father calmly. \n\n\"Aunt Chloe, sir, she told me.\" \n\nMy father devoted that evening and several evenings to giving me a clear account of New England: its early struggles, its progress, and its present condition. I was no longer unwilling to go North; on the contrary, the proposed journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights. Long before the moving day arrived I was eager to be off. My impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me a fine little Mustang pony, and shipped it to Rivermouth two weeks before the date set for our own journey. The pony completely resigned me to the situation. The pony's name was Gitana, which is the Spanish for \"gypsy\", so I always called her Gypsy. \n\nFinally the time came to leave the vine-covered mansion among the orange-trees, to say goodbye to little Sam(I am convince he was heartily glad to get rid of me), and to part with Aunt Chloe. I imagine them standing by the open garden gate; the tears are rolling down Aunt Chloe's cheeks; they and the old home fade away. I am never to see them again!", "questions": [{"input_text": "who did he kick?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "did he like the north?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "where was he born?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what did his father purchase for him?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what did he call people from the north?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "where did his parents move to?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how old was he then?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what did his aunt say?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "did he remember anything about the north?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who did he say gave him the stories?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who asked him?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what was the pony's name?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what was the Spanish name?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "when was it shipped?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "where did his father take him after kicking Sam?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what kind of teen did he think he was?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "why did father want to take him north?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "did he tell his friends he was born in north?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "how long ago was he born?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "how did his mates talk about northerners?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 971, "span_end": 1014, "span_text": "I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam", "input_text": "Sam", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1065, "span_end": 1139, "span_text": "and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 582, "span_end": 606, "span_text": "I was born in Rivermouth", "input_text": "Rivermouth", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 2789, "span_end": 2847, "span_text": "my father had purchased for me a fine little Mustang pony,", "input_text": "a Mustang pony,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1083, "span_end": 1139, "span_text": "I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees", "input_text": "Yankees", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 708, "span_end": 739, "span_text": "my parents moved to New Orleans", "input_text": "New Orleans", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 741, "span_end": 795, "span_text": "I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move", "input_text": "eighteen months", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1584, "span_end": 1655, "span_text": "Aunt Chloe, who said, \"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\" ", "input_text": "\"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\"", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1214, "span_end": 1250, "span_text": "I had no recollection of New England", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2364, "span_end": 2396, "span_text": "Aunt Chloe, sir, she told me.\" \n", "input_text": "Aunt Chloe", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 2321, "span_end": 2361, "span_text": "silly stories?\" asked my father calmly.

The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than 31 of the largest U.S. cities including neighboring Denver. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city, with population estimated at 63,335 in 2015. \n\nThe western two-thirds of the state is covered mostly by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government, leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two national parksGrand Teton and Yellowstonetwo national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges. \n\nOriginal inhabitants of the region include the Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone.

The last week before the holidays was an important one. There was an examination, by which the standing of the boys in the school was determined, and this time it was of more than ordinary importance, as the Randall scholarship of \u00a3100 a year for three years would be open in the summer to the competition of the first six boys.

The bars had been restored since he had wrenched them off to give ingress to the family on the day of recapture. He glanced around the room; nothing seemed to have been disturbed. Nevertheless he was uneasy. The suspicions of a frank, trustful nature when once aroused are apt to be more general and far-reaching than the specific distrusts of the disingenuous, for they imply the overthrow of a whole principle and not a mere detail. Clarence's conviction that Susy had seen Pedro recently since his dismissal led him into the wildest surmises of her motives. It was possible that without her having reason to suspect Pedro's greater crime, he might have confided to her his intention of reclaiming the property and installing her as the mistress and chatelaine of the rancho. The idea was one that might have appealed to Susy's theatrical imagination. He recalled Mrs. McClosky's sneer at his own pretensions and her vague threats of a rival of more lineal descent. The possible infidelity of Susy to himself touched him lightly when the first surprise was over; indeed, it scarcely could be called infidelity, if she knew and believed Mary Rogers's discovery; and the conviction that he and she had really never loved each other now enabled him, as he believed, to look at her conduct dispassionately. Yet it was her treachery to Mrs. Peyton and not to himself that impressed him most, and perhaps made him equally unjust, through his affections.

Penguins Mate for Life During the mid-2000s, films like \"Happy Feet\" made penguins all the rage, and young lovers went around spreading the facts like \"penguins mate for life.\" While the idea is sweet, it's not exactly true. Penguins usually stick with their partners through the mating season, but when it's time to mate again, they choose whomever is convenient, not necessarily their old flame. 2. Vincent Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear This is not entirely true. It was not his entire ear - just the tip of the lobe - and some say he didn't even do it. Van Gogh lived with artist Paul Gauguin, who had quite a violent temper, and many believe Gauguin actually did the cutting. Either way, Van Gogh did reportedly send the tip to a prostitute. 3. Napoleon Bonaparte was Short Everyone knows Napoleon Bonaparte was a tiny man - after all, his nickname was \"le Petit Corporal.\" His reputation for being short even inspired the phenomenon known as the \"Napoleon complex.\" In reality, Napoleon stood around 5 feet and 7 inches tall, which was very average back in the day. Many believe his nickname was meant as a term of endearment, not a reference to his height. 4. Ben Franklin Preferred a Turkey to a Bald Eagle The bald eagle is certainly a well-known representation of America, but legend has it that if Ben Franklin had his way, a turkey would have been much better. In reality, Franklin wrote a letter to his daughter mocking the eagle symbol used in a seal by the Society of the Cincinnati, a private military group. He said it looked like a turkey and may as well be one. 5. You Have Five Senses If you remember learning about the senses in elementary school, you know humans possess five: sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. Most scientists agree, however, that you have more like 10-20 senses, including pain, hunger, thirst, temperature, and more. 6. George Washington had Wooden Teeth George Washington is known for three things: being the first president, chopping down a cherry tree, and having wooden teeth. At least one of these is certainly not true. While Washington did have bad teeth, his dentures were not wooden. 7. Einstein was a Bad Student If you ever made bad grades and pulled the old \"Albert Einstein used to make bad grades\" card with your parents or teachers, you are lucky you got away with it. In reality, Einstein was at the top of his class and mastered calculus when he was barely a teenager. The reputation he developed for being a bad student had more to do with his behavior.

It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. \n\nTypically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the main topic?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Does it have another name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What would that be?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does it do?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is it used alone?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What else needs to be present for radio waves?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What type of electricity does it use?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is it made of?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What frequency is used?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "is it low?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 20, "span_text": "An antenna (plural a", "input_text": "An antenna", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 41, "span_end": 129, "span_text": " or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 45, "span_end": 51, "span_text": "aerial", "input_text": "aerial", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 83, "span_end": 123, "span_text": "converts electric power into radio waves", "input_text": "converts electric power into radio waves", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 156, "span_end": 202, "span_text": "sed with a radio transmitter or radio receiver", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 167, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "radio transmitter", "input_text": "radio transmitter", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 188, "span_end": 202, "span_text": "radio receiver", "input_text": "radio receiver", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 324, "span_end": 344, "span_text": "alternating current ", "input_text": "alternating current", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 664, "span_end": 724, "span_text": "an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors", "input_text": "metallic conductors", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 309, "span_end": 323, "span_text": "high frequency", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Antenna_(radio)Antenna_(radio)_f0c2fdc05580624b2afe4e1556fa49129da8b09c44736e18f076f2c0"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3zazr5xv01ie1z38eu0vqqa5bghzc4", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/P G Wodehouse___The Coming of Bill.txt/Chapter II_e83d9903724964313d8764f503a18488c42b576240ff031f9c8fc87", "story": "Chapter II \n\nAn Unknown Path \n\nKirk blinked.

He kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplar-tree until he reached his food pile, which, you know, is in the water. There he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches already sunken in the pond. This done, he swam over to where Lightfoot was watching. \"Hello, Lightfoot!\" he exclaimed. \"You are looking handsomer than ever. How are you feeling these fine autumn days?\" \n\n\"Anxious,\" replied Lightfoot. \"I am feeling terribly anxious. Do you know what day this is?\" \n\n\"No,\" replied Paddy, \"I don't know what day it is, and I don't particularly care. It is enough for me that it is one of the finest days we've had for a long time.\" \n\n\"I wish I could feel that way,\" said Lightfoot wistfully. \"I wish I could feel that way, Paddy, but I can't.

Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. \n\nBillie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. \n\nDuring her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. \n\nShe co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. \n\nHer early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. \n\nHer voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly voice was soon to become very famous and influential. \n\nShe was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. \n\nIn early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off. \n\nOn May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life. She experienced many violent relationships. She also became increasingly dependent on various drugs which contributed to her early death in 1959, aged just 44.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Billie Holiday?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is her nickname?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where was she born?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is here best friend and musical partner?", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Who is her Dad?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did her dad marry her mom?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is the name of her older sibling?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where did she use to stay?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where did she perform while working?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When did she joined her mother again?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was the name of the landlady?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 57, "span_text": "Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer and songwriter", "input_text": "a singer and songwriter", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 59, "span_end": 78, "span_text": "Nicknamed Lady Day ", "input_text": "Lady Day", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 378, "span_end": 464, "span_text": "Billie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "input_text": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 80, "span_end": 131, "span_text": " her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young", "input_text": "Lester Young", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 465, "span_end": 505, "span_text": " Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday)", "input_text": "Clarence Halliday", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 466, "span_end": 558, "span_text": "Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother.

He was born in one of New York's notorious slums. The children born here rarely did decent work after they grew up. However, Roger Rolls was an exception, for he was not only admitted to the university, but also he became a governor. At his inaugural press conference, a reporter asked him, \"What made you become the governor?\" Faced with more than 300 journalists, Rolls did not mention his struggle but only spoke of his primary school schoolmaster---Pierre Paul. \n\nIn 1961, Pierre Paul was engaged as the director and principle of Nobita Primary School. When he entered this school, he found the children here didn't cooperate with the teachers. Pierre thought up many ways to guide them, but none was effective. Later, he found these children were very superstitious , so when he gave lectures, he added a program of palm reading as a means of fortune-telling, with which he encouraged the students. \n\nWhen Rolls Jumped from the hathpace and walked to the platform with his small hands stretched out, Pierre Paul said, \"As soon as I see your slender little fingers, I know you will be the governor of New York State in future.\" At that moment, Rolls was shocked because only his grandmother inspired him once, saying that he could become the governor of New York State, so he remembered that remark and believed him. \n\nFrom that day on, the \"New York State Governor\" was like a banner that constantly inspired him to study energetically and make progress. Rolls no longer stained his clothes with mud, nor did he speak in foul language. He began to straighten his back when he was walking. In the next more than 40 years, he demanded himself according to the identity of a governor. At the age of 51, he finally became the governor of New York State. \n\nPut up a banner of faith for yourself and you will have the drive to struggle and the vitality of life.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was the first black governor", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 11, "span_text": "Roger Rolls", "input_text": "Roger Rolls", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "high13287.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3ps7w85z8z2ghpn6wi1m2c8gl7q9tw", "filename": "cnn_94cac334a9c77aad1587d4bbc7f82c7abeca0add.story", "story": "(CNN) -- If a fellow is going to spend 55 years working in the same place, he would be wise to count his blessings that the place is Riverdale. \n\n\"The first day I walked in, in 1958, I was 17 years old,\" said Victor Gorelick. \"I took a job as a fill-in art assistant.\" \n\nHe never went on to college.

A week ago I should have scoffed at the idea of David Thain as a prospective suitor for Letitia.

But if you prefer offbeat destinations, check out the following road-side attractions. \n\nWorld's Largest Ball of Paint \n\nAlexandria, Ind. \n\nIn 1977, Michael Carmichael set out to create the biggest ball of paint anywhere. Starting with a baseball as a center, he painted layer after layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness world Records. Visitors can paint the ball themselves and become part of history. \n\nThe Museum of Dirt \n\nBoston, Mass. \n\nThe museum is the idea of Glenn Johanson. Labeled glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free. \n\nMount Horeb Mustard Museum \n\nMount Horeb, Wis. \n\nIt's heaven for hot dog lovers! This museum claims to have world's largest collection of prepared mustard . Its more than 4,100 bottles of spices come from 60 nations, including Turkey and Tibet. Visitors learn the history of mustard, from how it's made to how it's advertised and sold. The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much, he even puts it on ice cream! \n\nPaper House \n\nRockport, Mass. \n\nSwedish immigrant Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper.

And he surely deserves additional praise: the man who popularized the clever literary attack on racism. I say clever because anti-slavery fiction had been the important part of the literature in the years before the Civil War. H. B. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin is only the most famous example. These early stories dealt directly with slavery. With minor exceptions, Twain planted his attacks on slavery and prejudice into tales that were on the surface about something else entirely. He drew his readers into the argument by drawing them into the story. Again and again, in the postwar years, Twain seemed forced to deal with the challenge of race. Consider the most controversial, at least today, of Twain's novels, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Only a few books have been kicked off the shelves as often as Huckleberry Finn, Twain's most widely read tale. Once upon a time, people hated the book because it struck them as rude. Twain himself wrote that those who banned the book considered the novel \"trash and suitable only for the slums .\" More recently the book has been attacked because of the character Jim, the escaped slave, and many occurences of the word nigger. (The term Nigger Jim, for which the novel is often severely criticized, never appears in it.) But the attacks were and are silly--and miss the point. The novel is strongly anti-slavery. Jim's search through the slave states for the family from whom he has been forcibly parted is heroic. As J. Chadwick has pointed out, the character of Jim was a first in American fiction--a recognition that the slave had two personalities, \"the voice of survival within a white slave culture and the voice of the individual: Jim, the father and the man.\" There is much more. Twain's mystery novel Pudd'nhead Wilson stood as a challenge to the racial beliefs of even many of the liberals of his day. Written at a time when the accepted wisdom held Negroes to be inferior to whites, especially in intelligence, Twain's tale centered in part around two babies switched at birth. A slave gave birth to her master's baby and, for fear that the child should be sold South, switched him for the master's baby by his wife. The slave's lightskinned child was taken to be white and grew up with both the attitudes and the education of the slave-holding class. The master's wife's baby was taken for black and grew up with the attitudes and intonations of the slave. The point was difficult to miss: nurture , not nature, was the key to social status. The features of the black man that provided the stuff of prejudice--manner of speech, for example-- were, to Twain, indicative of nothing other than the conditioning that slavery forced on its victims. Twain's racial tone was not perfect. One is left uneasy, for example, by the lengthy passage in his autobiography about how much he loved what were called \"nigger shows\" in his youth--mostly with white men performing in black-face--and his delight in getting his mother to laugh at them. Yet there is no reason to think Twain saw the shows as representing reality. His frequent attacks on slavery and prejudice suggest his keen awareness that _ did not. Was Twain a racist? Asking the question in the 21st century is as wise as asking the same of Lincoln. If we read the words and attitudes of the past through the \"wisdom\" of the considered moral judgments of the present, we will find nothing but error. Lincoln, who believed the black man the inferior of the white, fought and won a war to free him. And Twain, raised in a slave state, briefly a soldier, and inventor of Jim, may have done more to anger the nation over racial injustice and awaken its collective conscience than any other novelist in the past century.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the inventor of the American Novel?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What had been an important part of literature before the Civil War?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who wrote Uncle tom's cabin?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did they deal with?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Directly or indirectly?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What book did he write?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is it his most popular book?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which character has the book been attacked because of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is he?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do the attacks miss the point?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did J.

LESSONS \n\nTHE first few weeks were hard ones, for Polly had not yet outgrown her natural shyness and going among so many strangers caused her frequent panics. But her purpose gave her courage, and when the ice was once broken, her little pupils quickly learned to love her. The novelty soon wore off, and though she thought she was prepared for drudgery, she found it very tedious to go on doing the same thing day after day. Then she was lonely, for Will could only come once a week, her leisure hours were Fanny's busiest, and the \"bits of pleasure\" were so few and far between that they only tantalized her. Even her small housekeeping lost its charms, for Polly was a social creature, and the solitary meals were often sad ones. Ashputtel and Nick did their best to cheer her, but they too, seemed to pine for country freedom and home atmosphere. Poor Puttel, after gazing wistfully out of the window at the gaunt city cats skulking about the yard, would retire to the rug, and curl herself up as if all hope of finding congenial society had failed; while little Nick would sing till he vibrated on his perch, without receiving any response except an inquisitive chirp from the pert sparrows, who seemed to twit him with his captivity.

In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype. \n\nSoon, other people began to use Daguerre's process. Travellers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains. \n\nIn about 1840, the process was improved. Now photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of film and processing equipment. But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States, where from the 1840s daguerreotype artists were popular in most cities. \n\nMathew Brady was a well-known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life-like and full of personality. \n\nBrady was also the first person to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and ruined cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible \n\nIn the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography. Photographers could buy film readymade in rolls. So they did not have to make the film immediately. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later, meaning that they did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small handheld camera made photography less expensive. \n\nWith the small camera, anyone could be a photographer. People began to use cameras just for fun. They took pictures of their families, friends and favourite places. They called these pictures \"snapshots\". \n\nPhotographs became very popular in newspapers in the 1890s. Soon magazines and books also used documentary photographs. These pictures showed true events and people. They were much more real than drawings. \n\nPhotography had turned into a form of art by the beginning of the 20th century. Some photographs were not just copies of the real world.

The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715, and remained totally dominant until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in. The \"Whig Supremacy\" (1715\u20131760) was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failed Jacobite rising of 1715 by Tory rebels. The Whigs thoroughly purged the Tories from all major positions in government, the army, the Church of England, the legal profession, and local offices. The Party's hold on power was so strong and durable, historians call the period from roughly 1714 to 1783 the age of the \"Whig Oligarchy\".

They met in 1993, when they were studying computer science at Stanford University, USA. They dreamed of producing something that could also answer any question in seconds. Internet search engines at that time were slow and gave many websites that weren't useful. In January 1996, Page and Brin decided to make a better and faster search engine. They thought the results should be based on the most popular websites. Nobody would give them money for their project, so they used their own money. They also borrowed money from family and friends. Then, in 1998, they were given a _ for $100,000, and they started their own company. Their first office was in a friend's garage. The company's name is Google, a word which comes from mathematics. A \"google\" is a very high number---- 1 followed by a hundred zeros. The google search engine was soon used by thousands of people worldwide because it was fast, easy and correct. By 2002 it was the biggest search engine on the Internet. Now, more questions have been answered by Google than any other Internet service, from sport to science, and from music to medicine.

A large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island, he said. \n\nLarge quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth's crust, particularly visible along coastlines. \n\nThe island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast, GEO TV reported. \n\nZahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, confirmed the island had formed. He said it was \"not surprising,\" considering the magnitude of the earthquake. \n\nBut John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that generally it would be unlikely for such a large island to emerge from a quake like Tuesday's. \n\nMany things, such as the tide, could come into play regarding the rise of the island, he said.

They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries. \n\nThe Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is the normans in french ?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what was a great fief of medieval France ?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "The Normans were famed for  what ?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "anything else ?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what cuntury did they give thier name in ?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is a region of france ?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "norman comes from what ?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "from how many places ?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "cna you name them ?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "under what ruler ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "from where ?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how many inpacts the the dynasty have ?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "can you name them ?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "and the far west ?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what language did they adopt ?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "of what land ?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 40, "span_end": 48, "span_text": "Normands", "input_text": "Normands", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1197, "span_end": 1218, "span_text": "The Duchy of Normandy", "input_text": "The Duchy of Normandy", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 892, "span_end": 906, "span_text": "martial spirit", "input_text": "martial spirit", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 932, "span_end": 947, "span_text": "Christian piety", "input_text": "Christian piety", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 94, "span_end": 107, "span_text": "10th and 11th", "input_text": "10th and 11th", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 137, "span_end": 145, "span_text": "Normandy", "input_text": "Normandy", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 220, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "Norseman", "input_text": "Norseman", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 256, "span_end": 284, "span_text": "Denmark, Iceland and Norway ", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 256, "span_end": 284, "span_text": "Denmark, Iceland and Norway ", "input_text": "Denmark, Iceland and Norway", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1318, "span_end": 1327, "span_text": "Richard I", "input_text": "Richard I", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1331, "span_end": 1339, "span_text": "Normandy", "input_text": "Normandy", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 776, "span_end": 815, "span_text": "political, cultural and military impact", "input_text": "political, cultural and military impact", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 776, "span_end": 809, "span_text": "political, cultural and military ", "input_text": "political, cultural and military", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 848, "span_end": 857, "span_text": "Near East", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1040, "span_end": 1063, "span_text": "Gallo-Romance language ", "input_text": "Gallo-Romance language", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 848, "span_end": 857, "span_text": "Near East", "input_text": "Near East", "turn_id": 16}], "name": "NormansNormans_b85ddbeb892ba7727830f1eea97977955c80f073dd30db024b9d6af2"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3ru7gd8vpot0ucqyo7stexc9ombspq", "filename": "Gregorian_calendarGregorian_calendar_053768b1389a5cc1afc2a41a2ff5590a7ea396e45d0c536b699c64ce", "story": "To unambiguously specify the date, dual dating or Old Style (O.S.) and New Style (N.S.) are sometimes used with dates.

(O, for Crowe's costumed glory days in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World!) Jackman has a right to be cranky too, although he's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding God after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest.

It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \"nitrogen\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \u03bd\u1f30\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"nitre\" and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb6\u03bd \"to form\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek \u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. \n\nNitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. The name comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"to choke\", directly referencing nitrogen's asphyxiating properties. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen, a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (, singular \"provincia\") and one autonomous city (\"ciudad aut\u00f3noma\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation () as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. \n\nArgentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands (), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century. Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776.

Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately. \n\nTuppence's spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius's sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open. \n\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence.

The good woman of the house was a strict adherent to the forms of the church to which she belonged; and having herself been awakened to a sense of her depravity, by the ministry of the divine who harangued the people of the adjoining parish, she thought it was from his exhortations only that salvation could be meted out to the short-lived hopes of Henry Wharton. Not that the kind-hearted matron was so ignorant of the doctrines of the religion which she professed, as to depend, theoretically, on mortal aid for protection; but she had, to use her own phrase, \"sat so long under the preaching of good Mr.----,\" that she had unconsciously imbibed a practical reliance on his assistance, for that which her faith should have taught her could come from the Deity alone. With her, the consideration of death was at all times awful, and the instant that the sentence of the prisoner was promulgated, she dispatched Caesar, mounted on one of her husband's best horses, in quest of her clerical monitor. This step had been taken without consulting either Henry or his friends; and it was only when the services of Caesar were required on some domestic emergency, that she explained the nature of his absence. The youth heard her, at first, with an unconquerable reluctance to admit of such a spiritual guide; but as our view of the things of this life becomes less vivid, our prejudices and habits cease to retain their influence; and a civil bow of thanks was finally given, in requital for the considerate care of the well-meaning woman.
