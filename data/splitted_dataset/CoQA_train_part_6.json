He expected also to have the co-operation of Banks to do the same thing on the west shore. Of course I approved heartily. \n\nAbout the 10th of January Sherman was back in Memphis, where Hurlbut commanded, and got together his Memphis men, or ordered them collected and sent to Vicksburg.

He determined, therefore, to move directly upon Meridian. \n\nI had sent some 2,500 cavalry under General Sooy Smith to Sherman's department, and they had mostly arrived before Sherman got to Memphis. Hurlbut had 7,000 cavalry, and Sherman ordered him to reinforce Smith so as to give the latter a force of about 7,000 with which to go against Forrest, who was then known to be south-east from Memphis.

The consternation caused at Fawn Court in respect to Mr. Greystock's treachery almost robbed of its importance the suggestion made as to Lord Fawn. Could it be possible that this man, who had so openly and in so manly a manner engaged himself to Lucy Morris, should now be proposing to himself a marriage with his rich cousin? Lady Fawn did not believe that it was possible. Clara had not seen those horrid things with her own eyes, and other people might be liars. But Amelia shook her head. Amelia evidently believed that all manner of iniquities were possible to man. \"You see, mamma, the sacrifice he was making was so very great!\" \"But he made it!\" pleaded Lady Fawn. \"No, mamma, he said he would make it. Men do these things. It is very horrid, but I think they do them more now than they used to. It seems to me that nobody cares now what he does, if he's not to be put into prison.\" It was resolved between these two wise ones that nothing at the present should be said to Lucy or to any one of the family. They would wait awhile, and in the meantime they attempted,--as far as it was possible to make the attempt without express words,--to let Lucy understand that she might remain at Fawn Court if she pleased. While this was going on, Lord Fawn did come down once again, and on that occasion Lucy simply absented herself from the dinner-table and from the family circle for that evening. \"He's coming in, and you've got to go to prison again,\" Nina said to her, with a kiss.

The school was renamed Yale College in 1718 in recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale, who was governor of the British East India Company. Established to train Congregationalist ministers in theology and sacred languages, by 1777 the school's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences. In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. \n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The university's assets include an endowment valued at $25.6 billion as of September 2015, the second largest of any educational institution.The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many books are in it's library?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it a small library?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How does it rank among American libraries?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does it serve?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many are there?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which one was the original?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did it start?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it a public school?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What city is it in?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "In what state?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why was the name changed?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "From whom?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did he do?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Of what?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was it supposed to train?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When was the first PHD granted?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When did it become a university?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How much money is endowed?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Is that big?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1473, "span_end": 1483, "span_text": "15 million", "input_text": "15 million", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1503, "span_end": 1533, "span_text": "third-largest academic library", "input_text": "no, not at all", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1503, "span_end": 1533, "span_text": "third-largest academic library", "input_text": "third-largest academic library", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1432, "span_end": 1455, "span_text": "all constituent schools", "input_text": "all constituent schools", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 748, "span_end": 756, "span_text": "fourteen", "input_text": "fourteen", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 139, "span_end": 156, "span_text": "Collegiate School", "input_text": "Collegiate School", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 116, "span_end": 131, "span_text": "Saybrook Colony", "input_text": "Saybrook Colony", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 108, "span_end": 112, "span_text": "1701", "input_text": "1701", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 934, "span_end": 950, "span_text": "Yale Corporation", "input_text": "Yale Corporation", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 73, "span_end": 82, "span_text": "New Haven", "input_text": "New Haven", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 84, "span_end": 95, "span_text": "Connecticut", "input_text": "Connecticut", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 331, "span_text": "gift from Elihu Yale", "input_text": "got gift", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 321, "span_end": 331, "span_text": "Elihu Yale", "input_text": "Elihu Yale", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 341, "span_end": 383, "span_text": "governor of the British East India Company", "input_text": "governor", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 357, "span_end": 383, "span_text": "British East India Company", "input_text": "British East India Company", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 406, "span_end": 433, "span_text": "Congregationalist ministers", "input_text": "Congregationalist ministers", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 678, "span_end": 682, "span_text": "1861", "input_text": "1861", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 717, "span_end": 721, "span_text": "1887", "input_text": "1887", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1309, "span_end": 1322, "span_text": "$25.6 billion", "input_text": "$25.6 billion", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1349, "span_end": 1363, "span_text": "second largest", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Yale_UniversityYale_University_b9e5d0a3f917e887df34449097c3d1128cd0cbaa4a83912b66413a86"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3leiz60cdjzc31w52aq4o09x66pz9l", "filename": "House_of_Habsburg.txt", "story": "The House of Habsburg, also called House of Austria, was one of the most influential and outstanding royal houses of Europe.

After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving \"Swaraj\" or self-rule. \n\nGandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to \"Quit India\" in 1942.

There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, and later in the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nThe people of Somerset are mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's entry for AD 845, in the inflected form \"Sumurs\u00e6tum\", and the county is recorded in the entry for 1015 using the same name. The archaic name Somersetshire was mentioned in the Chronicle's entry for 878. Although \"Somersetshire\" was in common use as an alternative name for the county, it went out of fashion in the late 19th century, and is no longer used possibly due to the adoption of \"Somerset\" as the county's official name after the establishment of the county council in 1889. As with other counties not ending in \"shire,\" the suffix was superfluous, as there was no need to differentiate between the county and a town within it.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is one of famous cities in this area?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is it known for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Since when has this area been populated?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is the oldest way it was spelled?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When was it written?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When else?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did it change to the current way?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What are some features of the area?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What ruler did it support?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And acted in what other events?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 497, "span_end": 526, "span_text": "Bath is famous for its substa", "input_text": "Bath", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 504, "span_end": 553, "span_text": " famous for its substantial Georgian architecture", "input_text": "its architecture", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 191, "span_end": 252, "span_text": "There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times,", "input_text": "Paleolithic times", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 678, "span_end": 715, "span_text": " in the inflected form \"Sumurs\u00e6tum\", ", "input_text": "Sumursaetum", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 666, "span_end": 678, "span_text": " for AD 845,", "input_text": "845", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 744, "span_end": 785, "span_text": " the entry for 1015 using the same name.

Voices of the Dusk. \n\nJolly, round, red Mr. Sun was just going to bed behind the Purple Hills and the Black Shadows had begun to creep all through the Green Forest and out across the Green Meadows.

Peter felt at peace with all the Great World, for it was the hour of peace, the hour of rest for those who had been busy all through the shining day. \n\nMost of Peter's feathered friends had settled themselves for the coming night, the worries and cares of the day over and forgotten. All the Great World seemed hushed. In the distance Sweetvoice the Vesper Sparrow was pouring out his evening song, for it was the hour when he dearly loves to sing. Far back in the Green Forest Whip-poor-will was calling as if his very life depended on the number of times he could say, \"Whip poor Will,\" without taking a breath. From overhead came now and then the sharp, rather harsh cry of Boomer the Nighthawk, as he hunted his supper in the air. \n\nFor a time it seemed as if these were the only feathered friends still awake, and Peter couldn't help thinking that those who went so early to bed missed the most beautiful hour of the whole day. Then, from a tree just back of him, there poured forth a song so clear, so sweet, so wonderfully suited to that peaceful hour, that Peter held his breath until it was finished.

This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation. \n\nA \"cable channel\" (sometimes known as a \"cable network\") is a television network available via cable television. When available through satellite television, including direct broadcast satellite providers such as DirecTV, Dish Network and BSkyB, as well as via IPTV providers such as Verizon FIOS and AT&T U-verse is referred to as a \"satellite channel\". Alternative terms include \"non-broadcast channel\" or \"programming service\", the latter being mainly used in legal contexts. Examples of cable/satellite channels/cable networks available in many countries are HBO, MTV, Cartoon Network, E!, Eurosport and CNN International. \n\nThe abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for \"Community Access Television\" or \"Community Antenna Television\", from cable television's origins in 1948. In areas where over-the-air TV reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.

The allegation? He was put in the race by agents of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to siphon votes from the GOP. \n\n\"No doubt about it,\" says Danny Tarkanian, one of the many Republican Senate candidates hoping to challenge Reid in November. \n\n\"Nobody in the Tea Party knows who he is. He didn't know any of the principles of the Tea Party,\" Tarkanian tells CNN. \n\nTarkanian even accuses \"Harry Reid's staff, campaign, whatever\" of picking Ashjian because he's Armenian, as is Tarkanian. He explains, \"They know the Armenians are very close, they'll vote for each other.\" \n\nAs for Reid, an aide dismisses the accusations. As does Reid, who says he's never met Ashjian or \"anyone in his family.\" Reid tells CNN, \"I think there are too many conspiratorialists in the world today.

But it seemed that he always would be known mainly as a concert artist. However,his life took a different turn in the middle 1930s. At that time, the famous American music writer George Gershwin was looking for someone to play a leading part in his new work Porgy and Bess. The music critic of the New York Times newspaper suggested Todd Duncan. Duncan had almost decided not to try for the part as he knew it would not be easy to get it. But he changed his mind. He sang a piece from an Italian opera for Gershwin. He had sung only a few minutes when Gershwin offered him the part. He became famous because of the part in Porgy and Bess. \n\nTodd Duncan gained fame as an opera singer and concert artist. But his greatest love in music was teaching.

While the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is authenticity. In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \"the existential attitude\", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience. \n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher, though he did not use the term existentialism. He proposed that each individual\u2014not society or religion\u2014is solely responsible for giving meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely, or \"authentically\". Existentialism became popular in the years following World War II, and strongly influenced many disciplines besides philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology. \n\nThe term is often seen as a historical convenience as it was first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence\", as scholar Frederick Copleston explains. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is

There are plenty of competing elements left behind: the thousands of mainly young demonstrators who took to the streets of Sanaa and other cities in January to demand democratic change, the tribal alliance that took up arms against Saleh, secessionists in the south and a Shiite rebellion in the north, well-organized Islamist groups and a budding al Qaeda franchise. \n\nPerhaps the most powerful figure in Yemen now is Brig.

But, like any king whose throne has been taken away, the Swiss star is already planning secretly his return to power, beginning at this week's US Open. The problem is, many experts think he will never do it. They blame everything from age and tough competition to his racket and psychology. For years Federer, 27, had enjoyed the view from the top. Competitors saw him as undefeated, and for the most part he was. However, before the 2008 season began, Federer had an illness that stole his strength and clearly affected his play on the court. Ever since, he has struggled to return to form, winning just two of his last 14 tournaments. \"Twenty-seven is an age when _ .\" tennis great John McEnroe told the New York Times. Pancho Sefura, another tennis great, noted that Federer is also facing a maturing crop of young talents. \"There are too many great players now,\" he said, naming Britain's Andy Murray, 21, and Latvia's Ernests Gulbis, 20. US magazine Sports Illustrated tennis columnist Jon Wertheim suggested that part of Federer's problem could be his insistence on using a small racket. He says that the smaller head demands ball control. But we see time and again that racket makers try to get players to use a certain stick -- one they would like to market to consumers and it has a negative effect the professional game. Sports psychologist Jim Loehr told the Times that Federer is probably feeling \"a sense of doubt\" after being considered as undefeated for so long. If Federer is to recover his state of being undefeated, Loehr said he must overcome his doubt. \"Federer doesn't need fame and money. But he has to get better. He has to go to a whole new level. That's the only way he stays in the game,\" he said. As for beginning his first Grand Slam in ages as the NO.2 seed, Federer said it might be for the best. \"Five years almost, I was expected to win every tournament I entered,\" he said, \"so maybe Rafael Nadal now feels what I had to feel for a very long time. It will be interesting to see how he handles it.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How long was he the best at tennis?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "And where does he rank now?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what is he planning in secret?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "to begin where?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Do most think he will do it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What reasons do they have for thinking that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How old is he?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did he get so sick that it hurt his career?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many tournaments has he won recently?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "out of how many?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What has reporter Wertheim said might be part of the problem?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why does that matter?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Are the racket makers partly to blame?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "and how so?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does Loehr think might be bothering him?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "ANd what does he think he must overcome to become his old self?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What does he say that he doesn't need?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1925, "span_end": 1942, "span_text": "Five years almost", "input_text": "Five years almost", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 91, "span_end": 95, "span_text": "NO.2", "input_text": "NO.2", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 198, "span_end": 213, "span_text": "return to power", "input_text": "return to power", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 228, "span_end": 247, "span_text": "this week's US Open", "input_text": "this week's US Open", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 270, "span_end": 303, "span_text": "experts think he will never do it", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 332, "span_end": 387, "span_text": "age and tough competition to his racket and psychology.", "input_text": "age, tough competition,his racket, psychology.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 410, "span_text": "27,", "input_text": "27", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 520, "span_end": 548, "span_text": "before the 2008 season began", "input_text": "before the 2008 season began", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 701, "span_end": 705, "span_text": " two", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 718, "span_end": 720, "span_text": "14", "input_text": "14", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1151, "span_end": 1189, "span_text": "his insistence on using a small racket", "input_text": "his insistence on using a small racket", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1208, "span_end": 1241, "span_text": "smaller head demands ball control", "input_text": "smaller head demands ball control", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1274, "span_end": 1329, "span_text": "racket makers try to get players to use a certain stick", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1288, "span_end": 1375, "span_text": "try to get players to use a certain stick -- one they would like to market to consumers", "input_text": "They try to get players to use a certain stick -- one they would like to market to consumers", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1507, "span_end": 1523, "span_text": "a sense of doubt", "input_text": "a sense of doubt", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1659, "span_end": 1667, "span_text": "his doub", "input_text": "his doub", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1691, "span_end": 1706, "span_text": " fame and money", "input_text": "fame and money", "turn_id": 17}], "name": "high7031.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3x65qveqi0nuwam4zt9mibz7x9nclh", "filename": "Marshall_IslandsMarshall_Islands_e61ba771236b878548349ac566206e2fe4f7e2939bc1667dd1358e25", "story": "The Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Marshallese: Aolep\u0101n Aor\u014dkin M\u0327aje\u013c),[note 1] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, slightly west of the International Date Line.

Brar said he could not comment on Pakistani casualties. \n\nPakistani officials said severe weather conditions in Kashmir, a Himalayan region, hampered removal of the soldiers' bodies. Pakistan has asked the Indian local commanding authority for a full report on the incident. \n\nIndia and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir, which is claimed by both nuclear powers. \n\nOn August 20, an Indian army officer and five militants were killed in clashes along the Line of Control.

It should be almost as pleasant to us as to him to think that love was what made him do it, for he was sure he loved Grizel at last, and that the one longing of his heart was to marry her; the one marvel to him was that he had ever longed ardently for anything else. Well, as you know, she longed for it also, but she was firm in her resolve that until Elspeth was engaged Tommy should be a single man. She even made him promise not to kiss her again so long as their love had to be kept secret. \"It will be so sweet to wait,\" she said bravely. As we shall see presently, his efforts to put Elspeth into the hands of David were apparently of no avail, but though this would have embittered many men, it drew only to the surface some of Tommy's noblest attributes; as he suffered in silence he became gentler, more considerate, and acquired a new command over himself.

A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book, A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again.

Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. \n\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as the Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known. \n\nSet theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right, with an active research community. Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals. \n\nMathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers.

During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George. It is quite true that she also saw, riding behind them, her perfidious friend, Mrs. Houghton, and a gentleman whom at that time she did not know to be Lady George's father. This was early in March, when equestrians in the park are not numerous. Guss stood for a moment looking at them, and Jack De Baron took off his hat. But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. \n\nOn the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed.

A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE. This civilization collapsed at the start of the second millennium BCE and was later followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilization, which extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the Mahajanapadas.

The corporation, which has operated in the United Kingdom under the terms of a Royal charter since 1927, has produced television programmes from its own since 1932, although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 November 1936. \n\nThe domestic TV BBC television channels are broadcast without any commercial advertising and collectively they account for more than 30% of all UK viewing. The services are funded by a television licence. \n\nThe BBC operates several television networks, television stations (although there is generally very little distinction between the two terms in the UK), and related programming services in the United Kingdom. As well as being a broadcaster, the corporation also produces a large number of its own programmes in-house, thereby ranking as one of the world's largest television production companies. \n\nBaird Television Ltd. made Britain's first television broadcast, on 30 September 1929 from its studio in Long Acre, London, via the BBC's London transmitter, using the electromechanical system pioneered by John Logie Baird. This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines \u2013 just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters.

Arlen Specter, who embodied a vanishing breed of liberal Republicanism before switching to the Democratic Party at the twilight of his political career, died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, his family announced. \n\nSpecter died of complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at his home in Philadelphia, his family said. He was 82. \n\nThe veteran Pennsylvania politician had overcome numerous serious illnesses over the past two decades, including a brain tumor. He had been in the public eye since serving as a member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \n\nSpecter was elected to the Senate in 1980 and represented Pennsylvania for 30 years, longer than anyone in the state's history. His politically moderate image fit hand-in-glove in the politically blue Northeast, both with its Democratic centrists and its liberal Republicans. \n\nHe was also one of America's most prominent Jewish politicians, a rare Republican in a category dominated by Democrats over the decades. And his name is synonymous with Pennsylvania, an idiosyncratic state that pushes and pulls between the two parties, and his home, the staunchly Democratic city of Philadelphia. \n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia magazine called him \"one of the few true wild cards of Washington politics ... reviled by those on both the right and the left.\" \n\n\"Charming and churlish, brilliant and pedantic, he can be fiercely independent, entertainingly eccentric and simply maddening,\" the profile read. \n\nFormer Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, called Specter \"a mentor, colleague and a political institution\" who \"did more for the people of Pennsylvania over his more than 30-year career with the possible exception of Benjamin Franklin.\" And Pat Toomey, the Republican who now holds Specter's old Senate seat, praised him as \"a man of sharp intelligence and dogged determination.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is Arlen Specter?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What happened to him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did he die of?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did he die?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In Washington D.C.?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was he a conservative republican?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What kind was he?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When did he first enter the public's eye?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was the purpose of that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who has Specter's old Senate seat now?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did he say about him?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who said that quote?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When was Specter first elected?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Which state did he represent?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was he loved by both democrats and republicans?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What city did he live in?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Was he catholic?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What was his religion?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 9, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "Former U.S. Sen.

But ever since, that asset seemed to have been dwindling; and now he was almost beginning to despair. He was altogether cold at heart, and yet highly strung with apprehension, as he was shown into the blue drawing-room. \n\nStephen came in alone, closing the door behind her. She shook hands with him, and sat down by a writing-table near the window, pointing to him to sit on an ottoman a little distance away. The moment he sat down he realised that he was at a disadvantage; he was not close to her, and he could not get closer without manifesting his intention of so doing. He wanted to be closer, both for the purpose of his suit and for his own pleasure; the proximity of Stephen began to multiply his love for her. He thought that to-day she looked better than ever, of a warm radiant beauty which touched his senses with unattainable desire.

Now Jayson has fingers that open and close. \"It was a do-it-yourself, father-and-son adventure,\" says Paul. When Jayson was a baby, his doctor advised his parents not to give him a prosthetic hand until he was in his early teens. \"The doctor said Jayson should first learn to get full use out of the hand he was born with,\" says Paul. As Jayson got older, his father looked into _ a prosthetic hand, which can cost as much as $30,000. Paul found a more affordable solution. One day, Paul discovered a video on the Internet about Robohand, a prosthesis created with a 3D printer. He downloaded the free instructions and called Robohand's creators for advice. They told him all he needed was a 3D printer--which costs around $2,000--and some materials. Luckily, Jayson 's school had recently purchased a 3D printer and it offered to help Paul build the hand for Jayson n. \"We used a soccer shinguard , cardboard , and tape.

He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University, and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his \" in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe. \n\nThe philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth.\" The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\" Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist\".

But it looks set to move forward, and even some of the most determined doubters are starting to reconsider. \n\nLast Thursday, the government and Wang's company, Nicaragua Canal Development Investment, announced that construction will start on Dec. 22. \n\nThe development's estimated price tag -- $50 billion -- is four times the size of the entire Nicaraguan economy. The canal itself would be deeper, wider and longer than the Panama Canal, just a few hundred miles to the south. The Panama Canal's expansion is almost ready, which raises the question of why another costly canal is needed. \n\nThe Nicaraguan opposition has called the project the biggest scam in the country's history, and engineering experts are divided over whether the project is feasible. \n\nPedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua, the largest freshwater reservoir in Latin America.

More than 1,000 lawyers have volunteered to defend him, al-Saadi said. \n\nThe lawyers' appeal asked the Federal Court to change Al-Zaidi's case from assaulting Bush to insulting him. If Al-Zaidi is convicted of the former, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, al-Saadi said. \n\nThe lawyers are trying to persuade the appeals court that Al-Zaidi did not want to harm Bush by throwing the shoes, but simply wanted to insult him. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world. \n\nAl-Saadi said he met with his client several days ago but was having difficulty meeting with him again. He did not give the reason he was not allowed to see Al-Zaidi but said many lawyers have trouble meeting with detainees in Iraqi or U.S. custody.

Located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government. The capital city is Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, and the most populous city is Dededo. In 2015, 161,785 people resided on Guam. Guamanians are American citizens by birth. Guam has an area of 544 km2 (210 sq mi) and a density of 297/km\u00b2 (770/sq mi). It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia. Among its municipalities, Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km\u00b2 (3,691/sq mi), whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km\u00b2 (119/sq mi). The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe Chamorros, Guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers, like Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Catholic missionary. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons. During the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898. Under the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded Guam to the United States on December 10, 1898.

Although Chinese literature is getting more attention around the world, translated versions of Chinese works remain in small supply in places like the United States and Europe. Jonathan Chuck, an American who has been working in social media for three years in China, has read some ancient Chinese classics in Englishand can name several ancient poets such as Li Bai. Chuck said works of Chinese literature are hard to get in the United States, as bookstores simply don't carry many English translations. \"Besides, China is considered a mysterious country and far away from our daily life.\" Chuck said when he was in school, pupils mostly studied Western literature translated from French, German and Portuguese, not literature translated from Asian languages. \"China's Nobel prize will inspire more Westerners to notice Chinese literature, and I may read some of Mo's works,\" he added. Li Ling, a professor at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said Chinese literature has less of a market than English-language literature because Western culture is the dominant culture. Moreover, it is difficult to fully express some Chinese words in English, which can limit Chinese literature to a Chinese-literate audience, Li added. \"Western readers are more picky about what they read,\" he said, explaining that if a Chinese book is not translated well, it would be \" _ \" to recommend it to Western readers.

Two years later, \"Quantum of Solace\" opened 65 percent higher with $67.5 million on the way to $168.5 million total. (Reception for the film was tepid, which is why its endurance at the box office was so much weaker than \"Casino Royale's.\") And now \"Skyfall\" has improved upon \"Quantum's\" opening weekend by 30 percent.

The cover price was 25\u00a2 (equivalent to $ in 2016). \n\nIn the first issue, Wenner explained that the title of the magazine referred to the 1950 blues song, \"Rollin' Stone\", recorded by Muddy Waters, the rock and roll band the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan's hit single \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan's hit single: \"At [Ralph] Gleason's suggestion, Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song.\" \"Rolling Stone\" initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era. However, it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as \"Berkeley Barb\", embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press. In the very first edition, Wenner wrote that \"Rolling Stone\" \"is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces\".", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was the first issue of \"Rolling Stone\" published?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was the cost?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was the lead article?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was the music critic associated with the founding of this publication?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who else is associated with the founding of this publication?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where was this publication founded?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What song was the inspiration for the name of it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What musical group was also said to have inspired the title?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who sought funding for the beginning of this publication?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was one source of funding he obtained?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who else?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What type of art was it originally focused on?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What else was it originally focused on?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When did the focus shift?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What was one of the new areas it focused on?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 112, "span_end": 119, "span_text": "in 1967", "input_text": "in 1967", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 960, "span_end": 983, "span_text": "The cover price was 25\u00a2", "input_text": "The cover price was 25\u00a2", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 914, "span_end": 958, "span_text": " a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival", "input_text": "the Monterey Pop Festival", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 188, "span_end": 212, "span_text": " critic Ralph J.

Even though I'm not from South Africa and was about to play Mandela, they still gave me a lot of love,\" he says. By the end of filming, many were even calling him \"Madiba.\" \n\nThe experience, life-changing in many ways, was bound to feel odd. For Elba, the best way to capture not just the man but the feeling of playing him on film, was through music. \n\nNext week will see the release of \"Mi Mandela,\" a tribute to Mandela made up of songs written and produced by Elba himself, and performed by a mixture of South African and British talent, including Mumford & Sons, the Mahotella Queens and Maverick Sabre. \n\n\"There were various sensations I experienced (playing Mandela), and I could never give an answer I was satisfied with.

Lost in the crowd was his idea of security. And he was not far wrong. His cellar had a way of escape through a back door. Its grated window, under the level of the street, admitted light to his whirling lathe, but, aided by dirt on the glass, it baffled the gaze of the curious. \n\nHis evenings were spent in Candlemaker Row, where, seated by the window with his mother, Mrs. Wallace, and the two girls, he smoked his pipe and commented on Scotland's woes while gazing across the tombs at the glow in the western sky. Ramblin' Peter--no longer a beardless boy, but a fairly well-grown and good-looking youth--was a constant visitor at the Row. Aggie Wilson had taught him the use of his tongue, but Peter was not the man to use it in idle flirtation--nor Aggie the girl to listen if he had done so. They had both seen too much of the stern side of life to condescend on trifling. \n\nOnce, by a superhuman effort, and with an alarming flush of the countenance, Peter succeeded in stammering a declaration of his sentiments. Aggie, with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes, accepted the declaration, and the matter was settled; that was all, for the subject had rushed upon both of them, as it were, unexpectedly, and as they were in the public street at the time and the hour was noon, further demonstration might have been awkward.

The Honorable Heth was Bijah's creation, and a grand creation he was, as no one will doubt when they see him.

The _ would be found in his will, and would be officially handed over provided that Sally should be able to prove to the executors . \n\nAs soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the strong emotions created by the letter, she sent someone to the relative's home and subscribed for the local paper. \n\nFor the rest of the day Sally made confusion with his books, and Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs, not even take up a flower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had intended to do with it. For both were dreaming. \n\n\"Thirty thousand dollars!\" \n\nAll day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it, Sally in planning how to spend it. \n\nThere was no romance-reading that night. The children took themselves away early, for their parents were silent, disturbed, and strangely unentertaining. Two pencils had been busy during that hour -- note-making; in the way of plans. It was Sally who broke the stillness at last. He said, with excitement, \"Ah, it'll be grand, Aleck! Out of the first thousand we'll have a horse and a buggy for summer, and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for winter.\" \n\nAleck responded with decision and calmness. \n\n\"You can spend a part of it. But the whole of the capital must be put right to work. \n\n\"Why, yes. Yes, of course. Have you got it invested yet?\" \n\n\"No, there's no hurry about that; I must look around first, and think, er..., I've turned it over twice; once in oil and once in wheat.\" \n\n\"Why, Aleck, it's splendid! What does it amount to?\" \n\n\"I think -- well, to be on the safe side, about a hundred and eighty thousand clear, though it will probably be more.\" \n\n\"My! Isn't it wonderful? Good heaven! Luck has come our way at last, Aleck!\" \n\nThen they went up to bed, but they left the candle burning in the sitting room. They did not remember until they were undressed; then Sally was for letting it burn; he said they could afford it, if it was a thousand.

passionate home support in Belgrade. \n\nThe Czechs led 2-1 after winning Saturday's doubles rubber, meaning the hosts had to claim victory in both reverse singles to secure their first-ever appearance in the final. \n\nWorld number two Novak Djokovic, who missed Friday's opening singles with a stomach complaint, drew the two nations level at 2-2 when he recovered from the loss of the opening set to defeat Czech No.1 Tomas Berdych 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4. \n\nIt completed a miserable weekend for Wimbledon finalist Berdych, who lost both of his singles rubbers. \n\nThat result means Janko Tipsarevic had to defeat the previously unbeaten Radek Stepanek to seal Serbia's final place and he did just that, winning 6-0 7-6 6-4 to send the 15,000 home supporters into raptures. \n\nThere was less drama in the other semifinal, where France completed their domination over Argentina with a 5-0 whitewash victory in Lyon. \n\nThe French led 3-0 going into the final day, meaning nothing rested on the results of the reverse singles rubbers. \n\nHowever, Gilles Simon's 7-6 6-7 6-3 defeat of Eduardo Schwank meant the whitewash became a possibility -- and it was completed when Arnaud Clement beat Horacio Zeballos 7-5 6-1. \n\nThe victory ensures France, who dumped out holders Spain in the previous round, reached their first Davis Cup final since 2002. \n\n", "questions": [{"input_text":

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

As you did not come back I concluded that you were with Zikali, and walked about looking for you. Then food was brought to us and Heda and I breakfasted together, after which we went to where we heard the horses neighing and found that yours was gone. Returning, much frightened, we met Nombe, who gave me your note which explained everything, and we inquired of her why this had been done and what was to become of us. She smiled and answered that we had better ask the first question of the king and the second of her master Zikali, and in the meanwhile be at peace since we were quite safe. \n\n\"I tried to see Zikali but could not. Then I went to inspan the horses with the idea of following you, only to find that they were gone. Indeed I have not seen them from that day to this. Next we thought of starting on foot, for we were quite desperate. But Nombe intervened and told us that if we ventured out of the Black Kloof we should be killed.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined.

A favorite of millions of readers, a hero to scores of writers, he's been called \"America's greatest crime writer.\" The 86-year old author has been writing bestselling books for sixty years, mostly Westerns and crime novels. Many of them have been turned into hit movies, including \"3:10 to Yuma,\" \"Get Shorty\" and \"Out of Sight.\" \n\nNow, Leonard returns to one of his favorite characters in his newest book, his 45th novel to be exact, titled simply, \"Raylan.\" That would be U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens. The laid back, Stetson-wearing lawman first appeared in Leonard's novels, \"Pronto\" and \"Riding the Rap\" and again in the 2001 short story, \"Fire in the Hole\" which became the basis for the hit TV show, \"Justified,\" starring Timothy Olyphant as the title character. The actor and the show are winning over fans, critics and Leonard himself. So much so that Leonard has returned to writing about \"Raylan.\" \n\nThe book just hit store shelves the same week the show had its third season premiere. Leonard, gracious and unassuming, shows no signs of slowing down at this point in his career. \n\nThe author spoke to CNN from his home in Michigan. The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: What brought you back to Raylan? \n\nLeonard: I've always liked him. He's just one of my favorites. Now when I see him on the screen I can't believe it. He acts exactly the way I write him. He's so laid back and he always has the best line in the scene. He's perfect, boy. The way he talks I hear him just the way I heard him when I'm writing it. He's kind of laid back but if you call him on anything, he says, \"if I have to pull my gun I will shoot to kill,\" and he's serious about that but he doesn't have to sound that serious, he just states it.

Godoy Toscano is half-brother to Michoacan's governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel, who Wednesday urged his relative to surrender. \n\nAuthorities also said they are searching for Saul Solis Solis, alias \"El Lince,\" who lost his bid for a congressional seat this month. He is accused of being in charge of the cartel's activities in the Huacana area.

Horlock himself undertook the defence of his once more bitterly assailed Government and from the first it was obvious what the end must be. He spoke with the resigned cynicism of one who knows that words are fruitless, that the die is already cast and that his little froth of words, valedictory in their tone from the first, was only a tribute to exacting convention. Tallente had never been more restrained, although his merciless logic reduced the issues upon which the vote was to be taken to the plainest and clearest elements. He remained studiously unemotional and nothing which he said indicated in any way his personal interest in the sweeping away of the Horlock regime. He was the impersonal but scathing critic, paving the way for his chief. It was Dartrey himself who overshadowed every one that night. He spoke so seldom in the House that many of the members had forgotten that he was an orator of rare quality. That night he lifted the debate from the level of ordinary politics to the idyllic realms where alone the lasting good of the world is fashioned. He pointed out what government might and should be, taking almost a Roman view of the care of the citizen, his early and late education, his shouldering of the responsibilities which belong to one of a great community. From the individual he passed to the nation, sketching in a few nervous but brilliant phrases the exact possibilities of socialistic legislation; and he wound up with a parodied epigram: Government, he declared, was philosophy teaching by failures.

The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15\u201333 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. \n\nPhysiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What body part is the main focus?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What does it primarily do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is one thing it does to the overall system?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Does it help secrete something?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What does that assist in?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Can other things help with this?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Like what?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What can they help with specifically?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do all living things have brains?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 9, "span_text": "The brain", "input_text": "The brain", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 894, "span_end": 985, "span_text": "the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body", "input_text": "it controls the other organs of the body", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 27, "span_end": 69, "span_text": "serves as the center of the nervous system", "input_text": "serves as the center of the nervous system", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 987, "span_end": 1130, "span_text": "The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1088, "span_end": 1130, "span_text": "the secretion of chemicals called hormones", "input_text": "hormones", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1132, "span_end": 1225, "span_text": "This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment", "input_text": "This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1279, "span_end": 1335, "span_text": "can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1298, "span_end": 1335, "span_text": "the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia", "input_text": "the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1366, "span_end": 1385, "span_text": "control of behavior", "input_text": "control of behavior", "turn_id": 9, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 118, "span_end": 275, "span_text": " Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "BrainBrain_25d8c116def64bbd1afa9f24aeb6435f14f9e4131b307e4d19494745"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3o7l7bfshep737ycahi4gj7i1s8eim", "filename": "War_of_1812.txt", "story": "The War of 1812 (18121815) was a conflict fought between the United States, the United Kingdom, and their respective allies.

To man the blockade, Britain impressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. Incidents such as the \"Chesapeake\u2013Leopard\" Affair inflamed anti-British sentiment. In 1811, the British were in turn outraged by the \"Little Belt\" Affair, in which 11 British sailors died. British political support for a Native American buffer state, which conducted raids on American settlers on the frontier, hindered American expansion. On June 18, 1812, President James Madison, after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress, signed the American declaration of war into law.

It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland: she has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the name Alice's Adventures under Ground and gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the name Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day. It has been translated into over fifty languages and has had several movies based on it. The story is even mentioned in the popular 1999 film The Matrix by the character Morpheus.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where is Alice's Adventures?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who is the young girl?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does she follow?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Was the book popular?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What made it popular?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who is the author?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is that his real name?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is his real name?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where did he ride his boat?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was Alice an only child?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who did he give a story to?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who did he give a copy of the book to?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many words was it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When was it first printed?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who did the art?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Was it a success?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What other thing was Carroll's books about?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many languages has it been translated into?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What film is the book mentioned in?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "By what character?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 32, "span_text": "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", "input_text": "in Wonderland", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 122, "span_end": 169, "span_text": "It tells the story of a young girl named Alice,", "input_text": "Alice", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 170, "span_end": 191, "span_text": "who follows a rabbit ", "input_text": "a rabbit", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 32, "span_end": 86, "span_text": " is one of the most loved children's books of all time", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 324, "span_end": 374, "span_text": " popularity of the book comes from its imagination", "input_text": "its imagination", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 448, "span_text": ".

She had great, dreamy, hazel eyes, a milky skin dappled with little golden freckles, and delicately arched eyebrows, giving her a demure, questioning look which made people, especially lads in their teens, want to answer it. Her hair was ripely, ruddily brown and a little dent in her upper lip looked as if some good fairy had pressed it in with her finger at Rilla's christening. Rilla, whose best friends could not deny her share of vanity, thought her face would do very well, but worried over her figure, and wished her mother could be prevailed upon to let her wear longer dresses. She, who had been so plump and roly-poly in the old Rainbow Valley days, was incredibly slim now, in the arms-and-legs period.

The threads of Mrs. Grainger's influence were so ramified, indeed, as to be found in Mrs. Dallam, who declared she was the rudest woman in New York and yet had copied her brougham; in Mr. Cuthbert and Trixton Brent; in Mrs. Kame; in Mrs. Holt, who proclaimed her a tower of strength in charities; and lastly in Mr. Grainger himself, who, although he did not spend much time in his wife's company, had for her an admiration that amounted to awe. \n\nElizabeth Grainger, who was at once modern and tenaciously conservative, might have been likened to some of the Roman matrons of the aristocracy in the last years of the Republic. Her family, the Pendletons, had traditions: so, for that matter, had the Graingers. But Senator Pendleton, antique homo virtute et fide, had been a Roman of the old school who would have preferred exile after the battle of Philippi; and who, could he have foreseen modern New York and modern finance, would have been more content to die when he did. He had lived in Washington Square. His daughter inherited his executive ability, many of his prejudices (as they would now be called), and his habit of regarding favourable impressions with profound suspicion. She had never known the necessity of making friends: hers she had inherited, and for some reason specially decreed, they were better than those of less fortunate people.

People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \"genes\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \"word\" means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Offers of hospitality had been made to him by the dozen. Lady Hartletop's doors, in Shropshire, were open to him, if he chose to enter them. He had been invited by the Countess de Courcy to join her suite at Courcy Castle. His special friend, Montgomerie Dobbs, had a place in Scotland, and then there was a yachting party by which he was much wanted. But Mr Crosbie had as yet knocked himself down to none of these biddings, having before him when he left London no other fixed engagement than that which took him to Allington. On the first of October we shall also find ourselves at Allington in company with Johnny Eames; and Apollo Crosbie will still be there,--by no means to the comfort of our friend from the Income-tax Office. \n\nJohnny Eames cannot be called unlucky in that matter of his annual holiday, seeing that he was allowed to leave London in October, a month during which few chose to own that they remain in town. For myself, I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making; but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May. Young Eames, though he lived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no connection with the West End, had already learned his lesson in this respect. \"Those fellows in the big room want me to take May,\" he had said to his friend Cradell. \"They must think I'm uncommon green.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "where does Eames live?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "when did Apollo leave London?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "to go where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what does the author feel the best month of vacation is?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "when was Eames going in vacation?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "was he happy about that?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what did he say the people in the room  thought he was?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "was he connected to the West End?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "does Apollo have a lot of invites?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "when was Eames going to allington?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who was one of the people who had invited Apollo?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "where was she?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "do people in London like taking vacation in May?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "how long was apollo going to be in allington for?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "and how long did he want to be away from the office for?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "did he know what he was going to be doing then?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who was the special friend that had invited him?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "who had a place in scotland?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who else invited him?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "where was he to meet her if he decided?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 889, "span_end": 932, "span_text": " at Allington in company with Johnny Eames;", "input_text": "Allington", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 66, "span_end": 96, "span_text": " on the 31st of August, intend", "input_text": "August 31", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 40, "span_end": 66, "span_text": " left London for Allington", "input_text": "Allington", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1252, "span_end": 1309, "span_text": "I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making;", "input_text": "may", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1145, "span_end": 1176, "span_text": "ed to leave London in October, ", "input_text": "October", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1056, "span_end": 1084, "span_text": "s cannot be called unlucky i", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1593, "span_end": 1627, "span_text": "ey must think I'm uncommon green.\"", "input_text": "green", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1407, "span_end": 1453, "span_text": "nd had as yet no connection with the West End,", "input_text": "not at that time", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 308, "span_end": 364, "span_text": "Offers of hospitality had been made to him by the dozen.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1155, "span_end": 1176, "span_text": "e London in October, ", "input_text": "October", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 365, "span_end": 389, "span_text": "Lady Hartletop's doors, ", "input_text": "Lady Hartletop", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 386, "span_end": 413, "span_text": "s, in Shropshire, were open", "input_text": "Shropshire", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1309, "span_end": 1358, "span_text": " but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May.

THE CAPITULATION OF ROCCALEONE \n\nIn the sunshine of that bright May morning Francesco and his men went merrily to work to possess themselves of the ducal camp, and the first business of the day was to arm those soldiers who had come out unarmed. Of weapons there was no lack, and to these they helped themselves in liberal fashion, whilst here and there a man would pause to don a haubergeon or press a steel cap on his head. \n\nThree sentries only had been left to guard the tents, and of these Fortemani and a couple of his men had made prisoners whilst the others were removing the bridge by which the invaders had entered. And now beneath the open postern by the drawbridge gaped a surging torrent that no man would have the hardihood to attempt to swim. \n\nIn that opening, presently, appeared Gian Maria, his face red for once, and behind him a clamouring crowd of men-at-arms who shared their master's rage at the manner in which they had been trapped. \n\nAt the rear of the tents Valentina and her ladies awaited the issue of the parley that now seemed toward. The bulk of the men were busy at Gian Maria's cannons, and under Francesco's supervision they were training them upon the drawbridge. \n\nFrom the castle a mighty shout went up. The men disappeared from the postern to reappear a moment later on the ramparts, and Francesco laughed deep down in his throat as he perceived the purpose of this. They had bethought them of the guns that were mounted there, and were gone to use them against Valentina's little army.

Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order. Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize \"wu wei\" (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: \u6148 \"compassion\", \u5109 \"frugality\", and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 \"humility\". \n\nThe roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the \"Yijing\", which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei.

And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway.

The small, galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines and rattle of machinery, and now and then a shower of cinders pattered upon the roof; for the big mill that ground up the concrete was working across the road. The lattice shutters were closed, for the sake of privacy, and kept out the glare, though they could not keep out the heat, which soaked through the thin, iron walls, and Dick's face was wet with perspiration as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks. Some of these were broken, and some partly crushed. Delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring shelf, and a big steel apparatus that looked rather like a lever weighing machine stood in the shadow. \n\nWhere the draught that came through the lattices flowed across the room, Bethune lounged in a canvas chair, and another man, with a quiet, sunburned face, sat behind him. This was Stuyvesant, whose authority was only second to Fuller's. \n\n\"Brandon seems to have taken a good deal of trouble, but this kind of investigation needs the strictest accuracy, and we haven't the best of testing apparatus,\" Bethune remarked. \"I expect he'll allow that the results he has got may be to some extent misleading, and I doubt if it's worth while to go on with the matter.

Alick said everybody was gone to church \"but th' young missis\"--so he called Dinah--but this did not disappoint Adam, although the \"everybody\" was so liberal as to include Nancy the dairymaid, whose works of necessity were not unfrequently incompatible with church-going. \n\nThere was perfect stillness about the house. The doors were all closed, and the very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual. Adam heard the water gently dripping from the pump--that was the only sound--and he knocked at the house door rather softly, as was suitable in that stillness. \n\nThe door opened, and Dinah stood before him, colouring deeply with the great surprise of seeing Adam at this hour, when she knew it was his regular practice to be at church. Yesterday he would have said to her without any difficulty, \"I came to see you, Dinah: I knew the rest were not at home.\" But to-day something prevented him from saying that, and he put out his hand to her in silence. Neither of them spoke, and yet both wished they could speak, as Adam entered, and they sat down.

Alan was allowed to sit up in his bed and his bed was next to the room's only window. Henry had to spend all his time flat on his back. \n\nThe men talked for hours, of their wives, families, their homes and their jobs. And every afternoon when Alan, in the bed next to the window, could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Lovers walked arm in arm among flowers. Trees and skyline could be seen in the distance. As he described all this, Henry, on the other side of the room, would close his eyes and imagine the scene. \n\nOne warm afternoon Alan described a parade passing by. Although Henry could not hear the band, he could see it in his mind. Unexpectedly, an _ though: entered his head: why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything while I never got to see anything? It doesn't seem fair. Henry felt ashamed at first. But as the days passed and he missed seeing more sight, his envy grew and soon let him down. He began to find himself unable to sleep. He should be by that window ---- and that thought now controlled his life. \n\nLate one night, as he lay staring at the ceiling. Alan began to cough. He was choking. Henry watched in the dim room as the struggling man tried hard to reach for the button to call for help. Listening from across the room, he never moved, never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running. In less than five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped, along with the sound of breathing. Now, there was only silence ---- deathly silence. \n\nAs soon as it seemed appropriate, Henry asked if he could be moved next to the window.

And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that.\" \n\nBut he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. \n\nBush recalled their talk, \"I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have.\" \n\nBush said, \"We ended it the way we said we would\" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending \"would have been perfect.\" \n\nHe added, \"If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "what do Bill Clinton and George Bush now share?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what did they reflect on Monday?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what association did they visit in Louisiana?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what was Bush's biggest regret?", "turn_id": 5}], "answers": [{"span_start": 246, "span_end": 267, "span_text": "philanthropic efforts", "input_text": "philanthropic efforts", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 50, "span_end": 76, "span_text": "greatest regrets in office", "input_text": "greatest regrets in office", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 383, "span_end": 422, "span_text": "National Automobile Dealers Association", "input_text": "National Automobile Dealers Association", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 346, "span_end": 371, "span_text": "question-and-answer forum", "input_text": "question-and-answer forum", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 499, "span_end": 633, "span_text": "Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991.

As one of the group's chief ideologues and propagandists, al-Libi appeared in numerous recruitment videos in which he cast himself as a sheikh with the legitimacy to issue fatwas. \n\nOther than his appearances in propaganda videos, it's unclear which plots against the West al-Libi was involved in.

No one else within the group rivals his legitimacy as a religious scholar nor has the credibility in the Arab world to provide Islamic justifications for al Qaeda's global campaign of terrorism, he said.

Malachy beat more than 2,000 dogs, including a Dalmation, a German Shepherd and a Kerry blue Terrier. But to judge Cindy Bogels, Malachy was the clear winner. \"Super dog, and he had a surprising night, \" she said. \n\nDavid Fitzpatrick is Malachy's handler and coowner. He said there would be no more shows for the four-year-old dog. Malachy, he said, would most likely go home to East Brlin, Pennsylvania, to enjoy a quiet life in the country. ' He'll probably chase squirrels and will certainly have a good time. \" Fitzpatrick said. \n\nHowever, Malachy had a busy timetable on Feb,15.He made television appearances this morning and had lunch this afternoon at Sardi's a famous New York City restaurant, where he ate from a silver plate. Later, Malachy visited a businessman and TV personality, Donald Trump. \n\nDogs were not the only ones in the spotlight at Westminster. Young people ages 9 to 18 took part in Junior Showmanship. In this competition, judges looked carefully at the kids, not the dogs. They watched to see how well entrants handled their animals in the ring. About 100 kids from around the country came to New York City to show off their dogs. 11-year-old Macenzie Zeitz was one of them.

For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement. Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time. \n\n\"Of course you'll win one of them anyhow,\" said Jane, who couldn't understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise. \n\n\"I have not hope of the Avery,\" said Anne. \"Everybody says Emily Clay will win it. And I'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody. I haven't the moral courage. I'm going straight to the girls' dressing room. You must read the announcements and then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do DON'T sympathize with me.

It retained the Sumerian language for religious use (as did Assyria), but already by the time Babylon was founded, this was no longer a spoken language, having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian.

Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

SCOTT, Lord of the Isles. \n\n'Sir, I have something to show you.' \n\nIt was the early twilight of a summer's morning when Ringan crept up to the shelter of pine branches under which George Douglas was sleeping, after hotly opposing Gebhardt, who had nearly persuaded his master that retreat was inevitable, unless he meant to be deserted by more than half his men. \n\nGeorge sat up. 'Anent the ladies?' he said. \n\nRingan bowed his head, with an air of mystery and George doubted no longer, but let him lead the way, keeping among the brushwood to the foot of the quarry whence the castle had been built.

It was dawning upon him that something of his was threatened. \n\nSheppard's mouth stretched in disgust. \"Rufus's father died before he was born,\" he said. \"His mother is in the state penitentiary .

Organic compounds are rare terrestrially, but of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. The most basic petrochemicals are considered the building blocks of organic chemistry. \n\nFor historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds, such as carbides, carbonates, simple oxides of carbon (for example, CO and CO), and cyanides are considered inorganic. The distinction between \"organic and inorganic\" carbon compounds, while \"useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry... is somewhat arbitrary\". \n\nOrganic chemistry is the science concerned with all aspects of organic compounds.

This was the widespread conception that substances found in organic nature are created from the chemical elements by the action of a \"vital force\" or \"life-force\" (\"vis vitalis\") that only living organisms possess. Vitalism taught that these \"organic\" compounds were fundamentally different from the \"inorganic\" compounds that could be obtained from the elements by chemical manipulations. \n\nVitalism survived for a while even after the rise of modern ideas about the atomic theory and chemical elements. It first came under question in 1824, when Friedrich W\u00f6hler synthesized oxalic acid, a compound known to occur only in living organisms, from cyanogen. A more decisive experiment was W\u00f6hler's 1828 synthesis of urea from the inorganic salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate. Urea had long been considered an \"organic\" compound, as it was known to occur only in the urine of living organisms.

It's hard to get a clear result. Will there be a better indicator than litmus paper? The three kids decided to try and find out! How? They went to collect over 40 plants in parks, gardens and markets. Then they ground leaves, flowers and stems to get the pigments from them. The kids mixed pigments with acid and base.

You can prevent this happening by following a few careful steps. \n\nBasic Security \n\nDo not leave your bicycle in out-of-the-way places. Always lock your bicycle when you leave. Secure it to lampposts or trees. Take off smaller parts and take them with you, for example lights and saddles . \n\nLocks \n\nGet a good lock. There are many different types in the shop. Buy one that has been tested against attack. Ask for a recommendation from a bike shop. \n\nMarking \n\nSecurity marking your bike can act as a deterrent to a thief. It can also help the police find your bicycle. It should be clearly written and include your postcode and your house or flat number. This will provide a simple way to identify your bicycle. \n\nRegistration \n\nThere are a number of companies who will mark your bicycle for you. They will then put your registration number and personal details on their computer database. Then if your bicycle is found it will be easy to contact you. \n\nFinally \n\nKeep a record of the bicycle yourself: its make, model and registration number.

Scientists found that the secret of this rich soil was charcoal . Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago. \n\nNow, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years. \n\nMingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into \"biochar\" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. \n\nBiochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground. \n\nThe researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity. \n\nThe results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations. \n\nNext, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes. \n\nMingxin Guo says he learns about the \"black gold\" in Brazil from a magazine story.

Cabral died, becoming the latest victim in a wave of violence that has rocked the nation ahead of elections. \n\nGuatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared three days of national mourning in honor of the singer. \n\nIn Guatemala on a Latin American tour, Cabral, 74, left his hotel early Saturday morning in a white SUV for an eight-minute ride to the airport. \n\nGunmen attacked the SUV -- at least 20 bullet holes could be seen on the Range Rover. Nothing was reported stolen from the vehicle, government spokesman Ronaldo Robles said Saturday. \n\nPolice found a brown Hyundai Santa Fe nearby containing bullet-proof vests and AK-47 magazines. \n\nRobles and other authorities have said an investigation was underway. \n\n\"You can't blame New Yorkers for the death of John Lennon. Just like you can't blame Guatemalans for the death of Facundo Cabral,\" said Ernesto Justo Lopez, the Argentine ambassador to Guatemala. \n\nIronically, Cabral, who said he was inspired by Jesus Christ and Mohandas Gandhi, was recognized in 1996 by the Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a \"World Peace Messenger.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is the suspect name mentioned who killed the singer?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was he the actual target?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Then who was?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who is he?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was the singer famous?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What day was it when he was shot?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was he heading to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was the other guy dead too?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many days of mourning was announced in respect to the singer's death?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was he in an SUV?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What color?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many bullets were fired?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was anything stolen from the car?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 35, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "Gunmen ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 486, "span_end": 504, "span_text": "and not the artist", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 371, "span_end": 383, "span_text": "Henry Farina", "input_text": "Henry Farina", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 347, "span_end": 369, "span_text": "Nicaraguan businessman", "input_text": "Nicaraguan businessman", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 759, "span_end": 824, "span_text": "declared three days of national mourning in honor of the singer.

The population was 71,293 at the 2011 census. \n\nThe island was originally inhabited by the Kalinago and later colonised by Europeans, predominantly by the French from the 1690s. Columbus is said to have passed the island on Sunday, 3 November 1493, and the island's name is derived from the Latin for \"Sunday\". Great Britain took possession in 1763 after the Seven Years' War and gradually established English as the official language.

Dominica has been nicknamed the \"Nature Isle of the Caribbean\" for its natural environment. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest hot spring, called Boiling Lake. The island has lush mountainous rainforests, and is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland.

She said the medical experts in Switzerland and France came from different medical fields. \n\n\"I don't doubt them. But they are different skills. They are different types of medicines,\" she said. \n\nThe French findings will do little to quell the rumors that Arafat was poisoned. \n\nArafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital in November 2004 after he had a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma.

It became the seat of a Sino-Tibetan-speaking kingdom of Nanzhao in the 8th century AD. Nanzhao was multi-ethnic, but the elite most-likely spoke a northern dialect of Yi. The Mongols conquered the region in the 13th century, with local control exercised by warlords until the 1930s. From the Yuan dynasty onward, the area was part of a central-government sponsored population movement towards the Southwestern frontier, with 2 major waves of migrants arriving from Han-majority areas in northern and southeast China. As with other parts of China's southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of majority Han people into the region. These two waves of migration contributed to Yunnan being one of the most ethnically diverse provinces of China, with ethnic minorities accounting for about 34 percent of its total population.

There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile.

Ah! you are in haste-- wish to be shaved without delay--ecco! And this is a morning when every one has grave matter on his mind. Florence orphaned--the very pivot of Italy snatched away--heaven itself at a loss what to do next. _Oime_! Well, well; the sun is nevertheless travelling on towards dinner-time again; and, as I was saying, you come like cheese ready grated. For this young stranger was wishing for an honourable trader who would advance, him a sum on a certain ring of value, and if I had counted every goldsmith and money-lender in Florence on my fingers, I couldn't have found a better name than Menico Cennini. Besides, he hath other ware in which you deal--Greek learning, and young eyes--a double implement which you printers are always in need of.\" \n\nThe grave elderly man, son of that Bernardo Cennini, who, twenty years before, having heard of the new process of printing carried on by Germans, had cast his own types in Florence, remained necessarily in lathered silence and passivity while Nello showered this talk in his ears, but turned a slow sideway gaze on the stranger. \n\n\"This fine young man has unlimited Greek, Latin, or Italian at your service,\" continued Nello, fond of interpreting by very ample paraphrase. \"He is as great a wonder of juvenile learning as Francesco Filelfo or our own incomparable Poliziano.

The hunter supposedly walked more than a hundred miles back to civilization and miraculously survived his injuries. However, by the time she meets him, the story turns out to be a somewhat exaggerated legend where the \"bitten-off leg\" turns out to be just being some bad scarring on his leg; a \"love bite\" as Mick calls it. Still _ by the idea of \"Crocodile Dundee\", Sue continues with the story. They travel together out to where the incident occurred, and follow his route through the bush to the nearest hospital. Despite his old-fashioned views, the pair eventually become close, especially after Mick saves Sue from a crocodile attack. \n\nFeeling there is still more to the story, Sue invites Mick back to New York with her, as his first trip to a city (or \"first trip anywhere,\" as Dundee says). The rest of the film depicts Dundee as a \"fish out of water,\" showing how, despite his expert knowledge of living outdoors, he knows little of city life. Mick meets Sue's boyfriend, Richard, but they do not get along. By the end of the film, Mick is on his way home, lovesick, when Sue realizes she loves Mick, too, and not Richard. She runs to the subway station to stop Mick from leaving and, by passing on messages through the packed-to-the-gills crowd, she tells him she won't marry Richard, and she loves him instead.

A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 (botan\u0113) meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 is in turn derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (boskein), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. \n\nBotany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.", "questions":

The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

They become as close as it is possible for a human and an animal to be. \n\nBut World War I breaks out. Dad has to sell the horse to an English Army officer to pay the rent. Joey and Albert can no longer be together. Albert promises Joey that they'll find each other again one day. Then Albert goes on a journey to search for his friend. \n\nBut the four years of war are about Joey's journey. He starts as the mount of the English officer. Then he becomes a German workhorse.

He wrote poems about people who worked hard through life but still found things to be happy about. He wrote plays and books about justice for all people, and he wrote kids' books, too. The Sweet and Sour Animal Book is a book of his animal poems. Pictures and photos were used in the book. \"Hold fast to dreams\" is a line in a famous Hughes poem. That's exactly what he did throughout his life. When Steven Spielberg was in middle school, he wanted to make a film. He had an idea for a movie, but no money. He started a tree-planting business and made his film with the money he earned. Spielberg never stopped making films, even after many film schools refused him. Today he is one of the most popular and important filmmakers in the world. His movies are about people who are adventurous , brave, kind. His characters often fight for what is good. Some of his films are about his Jewish background, such as Schindler's List.
