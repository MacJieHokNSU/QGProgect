Vane, as it happened, had met Kitty Blake by accident and had asked her to accompany him on a visit to Celia.

Lincoln received no more than five years of formal education throughout his lifetime. When he grew up, he joined politics and had 12 major failures before he was elected the 16th President of the United States of America. Newton was the greatest English mathematician of his generation. His work on optics and gravitation made him one of the greatest scientists the world has even known. Many thought that Newton was born a genius, but he wasn't! When he was young, he did very poorly in grade school, so poor that his teachers became helpless in improving his grades. Beethoven is widely regarded as one of history's great composers. His reputation has inspired composers, musicians and audiences who were to come after him.

The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother who attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy. \n\nThey tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was excellent. By the time he graduated, he had earned considerable fees for his works. \n\nWhen the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming, where Albrecht drank a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled him to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \"Now you can go to Nuremberg to look for your dream, and I will take care of you.\" \n\nTears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side, Albert sobbed, \"No... no... no...no. It is too late for me. Look...look at what four years in the mines has done to my hands! I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less draw delicate lines with a pen or a brush... For me, it is too late.\" \n\nTo show thanks to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply \"Hands\", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed it \"The Praying Hands\". \n\nThe next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look.

Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945.

At the start of the space programme there was strong resistance from some people against having women in space. However, some women were very keen to become astronauts and in the end they were successful. In 1978, NASA began the first training programme for women astronauts. \n\nJudy Resnick and Christa McAuliffe were both astronauts and they were both women, but in many other ways they were very different. Both of them were on Flight STS-5L-L. Judy Resnick was born in 1949 and studied engineering at university and went on to obtain a PhD in 1977. She was a member of the first group of women selected for astronaut training in 1978, and in 1984, she became the second woman in space. During that flight, she helped to launch three new satellites and she carried out a programme of research. She was, in many ways, a professional astronaut whose whole life was devoted to space travel. \n\nChrista McAuliffe was born in 1948 and she was an astronaut almost by accident. In 1984, NASA decided to find a teacher who could accompany astronauts into space. They hoped that she would be able to communicate with students from space and encourage every one of them to be interested in space travel. Christa was a secondary teacher in history and social studies. She was a gifted teacher and she was selected from over 11,000 applicants to go on flight STS-51-L.

Edwin called himself Earl of Mercia, and held the Danish burghs. On the extreme northwest, the Roman city of Chester was his; while on the extreme southeast (as Domesday book testifies), Morcar held large lands round Bourne, and throughout the south of Lincolnshire, besides calling himself the Earl of Northumbria.

Glasses are very important to many people. Do you know how they were invented and developed? Glasses took a long time to develop into what you can find in the glasses store today. The Chinese first used colored glasses as fashion. They thought that those glasses had magic, but they didn't think that glasses could help eyes to see clearly. In 1262, the inventor, Roger Bacon, discovered the amazing function of lenses , and he thought that glasses could be used to help people to see. Twenty years later, in Florence, Italy, the inventor, Alessandro di Spina, made the first pair of glasses that could help people to see. Although these glasses worked, scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see. They thought that eyes sent out light onto whatever a person was looking at, and then the light came back to the eyes. Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked. Inventors continued to improve glasses. In 1784, Ben Franklin created glasses that had bifocal lenses. Many years later, in 1827, George Airy made circle-shaped glasses to correct _ , an eye problem that stops the eyes from seeing things clearly.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What do people need to see clear?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "are they important?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who created them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what was their purpose?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "did they work?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "did they ever find out how?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who found this?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "did they always stay the same?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what changed?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who made those?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "were there other changes?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what did he change?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what was their purpose?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who used glasses first?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what did they think of them?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1, "span_end": 59, "span_text": "I can't see clearly, because I don't wear my glasses today", "input_text": "glasses", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 112, "span_end": 153, "span_text": "Glasses are very important to many people", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 652, "span_end": 733, "span_text": "Alessandro di Spina, made the first pair of glasses that could help people to see", "input_text": "Alessandro di Spina", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 453, "span_end": 460, "span_text": "In 1262", "input_text": "In 1282", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 696, "span_end": 733, "span_text": "glasses that could help people to see", "input_text": "help people to see", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 735, "span_end": 764, "span_text": "Although these glasses worked", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 766, "span_end": 825, "span_text": "scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see", "input_text": "scientists didn't understand how", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 998, "span_text": "Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 998, "span_text": "Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked", "input_text": "Johannes Kepler", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1000, "span_end": 1038, "span_text": "Inventors continued to improve glasses", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1000, "span_end": 1038, "span_text": "Inventors continued to improve glasses", "input_text": "they continued to improve", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1049, "span_end": 1101, "span_text": "Ben Franklin created glasses that had bifocal lenses", "input_text": "bifocal lenses", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1049, "span_end": 1102, "span_text": "Ben Franklin created glasses that had bifocal lenses.", "input_text": "Ben Franklin", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1130, "span_end": 1168, "span_text": "George Airy made circle-shaped glasses", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1130, "span_end": 1179, "span_text": "George Airy made circle-shaped glasses to correct", "input_text": "George Airy", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1130, "span_end": 1168, "span_text": "George Airy made circle-shaped glasses", "input_text": "made circle-shaped glasses", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1169, "span_end": 1246, "span_text": "to correct _ , an eye problem that stops the eyes from seeing things clearly.", "input_text": "to correct an eye problem", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 292, "span_end": 330, "span_text": "The Chinese first used colored glasses", "input_text": "The Chinese", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 292, "span_end": 341, "span_text": "The Chinese first used colored glasses as fashion", "input_text": "fashion", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 343, "span_end": 384, "span_text": "They thought that those glasses had magic", "input_text": "they had magic", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle7162.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3u4j9857oebc7k5whzchomboj0f7bk", "filename": "middle5261.txt", "story": "Ken and Anthony were childhood friends.

They were trying so hard, but still could not find any clue to where the turtle went. Finally, a girl named Samantha went on the radio and said that she found Brian eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage. She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting Brian! For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves. Charlie finally had an idea.

We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\" \n\nMale and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\" he says. \n\nThe male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. \n\nThe female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. \n\nBoys and girls also hear differently. \" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \" says Chadwell. \" They think you're mad and can shut down. \" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. \n\nA boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. \n\nThese differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are the names of the two teachers?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What grade do they teach?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What do they think is a good idea.", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What color attracts boys eyes?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What are boys more likely to draw?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What about females?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Do boys and girls see the world the same?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is one color female eyes are attracted to?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is another color?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does the instructor need more movement to keep girls attention than boys?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Do both sexes hear things the same?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How do girls interpret loud speech?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who is David Chadwell?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 79, "span_end": 107, "span_text": " teachers Carneau and Lynne ", "input_text": "Carneau and Lynne", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 67, "span_end": 89, "span_text": "second-grade teachers ", "input_text": "second", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 126, "span_end": 216, "span_text": "separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders ", "input_text": "separating primary boys and girls", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 649, "span_end": 711, "span_text": "male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black", "input_text": "silver and black", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 730, "span_end": 782, "span_text": "that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects ", "input_text": "moving objects", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 793, "span_end": 827, "span_text": "drawing the happy color1ful family", "input_text": "happy color1ful family", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 430, "span_end": 483, "span_text": "ale and female eyes are not organized in the same way", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 857, "span_end": 921, "span_text": "emale eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red,", "input_text": "red,", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 916, "span_end": 940, "span_text": " red, yellow and orange.", "input_text": "yellow", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 974, "span_end": 1032, "span_text": "the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1142, "span_end": 1179, "span_text": "Boys and girls also hear differently.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1267, "span_end": 1307, "span_text": "They think you're mad and can shut down.", "input_text": "They  can shut down.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 218, "span_end": 294, "span_text": "David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education says", "input_text": "South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "high21212.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "32q90qcq1sly92o0ak3gtzmvspvkem", "filename": "mc500.train.34", "story": "Sometimes Karen likes to go to the library.

But parents don' t see it as a bad influence, either. \n\nAmanda Lenhart, a senior researcher said, \"Technology is not so magic as to make your child get straight A and improve all aspects of your life. As you grow to know it, you realize its power and disadvantages.\" \n\nBut as with the emergence of television in American homes in the 1950s and 1960s, the Internet continues to cause strong reactions from parents. \n\n\"There's too much garbage online for kids,\" said Patrick Thomas as he picked up his 15-year-old son from school. \"It's like a kid walking down the street. He's got to watch out. He never knows who he might come across.\" \n\nThomas used to have Internet service at home but got rid of it a year ago because he was worried about viruses infecting his computer and strangers taking advantage of his son Zachary.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features.

Becoming professional at the age of 17, Li has set many milestones for Chinese tennis. She was the first Chinese player to win a WTA title and the first to break into the top 20. Li won the 2011 French Open title and became the first Asian player to ever win a Slam. By winning this year's Australian Open, she became the first Asian player with two Slams. As excellent as her tennis abilities are, Li's sense of humor is _ too. She often jokes about life with her husband in interviews, changing them into funny comedy shows. Her speech at the Australia Open in January is just the best example. During her 15-year professional career, Li has helped the improvement of tennis in China. Earlier this month, Chinese another player Peng Shuai, 28, made the semifinals of the US Open. Last week, a new tennis match started in Li's hometown of Wuhan. \"I've seen changes happening in front of my eyes, young girls picking up tennis rackets, setting goals ... and believing in themselves,\" Li said in an online post. Li is more than a sports superstar. As WTA chief executive Stacey Allaster said, she is \"a pioneer who opened doors to tennis for hundreds of millions of people throughout China and Asia.\" Li said she planned to take care of my family and then to open a tennis school in China after her retirement.

These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2. \n\nPachauri can expect some opposite responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode. \"I have a little bit and enjoy it,\" said Torode. \"Too much for any person is bad. But there's a bigger issue here: where the meat comes from. If we all bought British and stopped buying imported food, we'd save a huge amount of carbon emissions.\" \n\nProfessor Robert Watson, the chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, said government could help educate people about the benefits of eating less meat, but it should not regulate. \"Eating less meat would help, there's no question about that,\" Watson said. \n\nHowever, Chris Lamb, head of marketing for pig industry group BPEX, said the meat industry had been unfairly targeted and was working hard to find out which activities had the biggest environmental impact and reduce them. \"Some ideas were contradictory,\" he said. \"For example, one solution to emissions from cattle and other animals was to keep them indoors, but this would damage animal welfare.

The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person, and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy.

But when they asked, the only response which they got was that \"rules are rules.\" Not satisfied, the teens decided to explore the issue themselves. \n\nFor their new study, Ashleigh and Leah, seniors at Willcox High School in Willcox, Arizona., borrowed materials from the hospital where they had been trained as nursing assistants. Ten nurses there agreed to give them little scrapings off the top side of their nails. Half of the participants had natural nails. The other half wore nail polish or fake nails on top of their natural nails. The teens grew bacteria from the scrapings on plates; these are plastic dishes with a gel that feeds bacterial growth. \n\nNatural nails produced an average of 4.3 bacterial colonies. In contrast, scrapings from nail polish or artificial nails produced an average of 17.5 colonies! Leah and Ashleigh had their answer to the question. Only natural nails are allowed because polished or artificial nails tend to harbor far more bacteria. The germs could be dangerous to sick patients. \n\nLeah notes that they are not the first to look at nails in a medical setting. Still, she says, \"It is something that should be taken much more seriously than it is.\" To emphasize that, she points to the large list of similar studies she and Ashleigh uncovered during their research. \n\nWhen nurses touch patients, they often wear gloves, but many small tasks are performed bare-handed. The teens hope to raise awareness of how dangerous artificial nails can be in the medical setting. \"What shocked me,\" Leah says, \"is how unconcerned some of the nurses were. They did not think their nails were dangerous.\" Ashleigh agrees and observes that to preserve their manicures , nurses with polish or fake nails tended to scrub less vigorously when washing their hands. Their nails might look nice, but this might contribute to the large numbers of germs that hang onto their nails. \n\nAshleigh has never really liked nail polish, so she will not have to change much to pursue her dream of being a surgeon. But the results have reminded Leah, who wants to be a nurse, to give up her artificial nails for good. \"They are very pretty,\" she says, \"I love them.\" But now that she knows the risks they can cause, she admits that for a health professional they just are \"not worth it.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What question did the two 18 year olds have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who were they?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Their names?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did Ashleigh want to become?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "After that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What about Leah?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was the answer they received to their question?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did they find an answer themselves?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was it?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "On average, how much more bacteria do fake nails produce?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What's one of the reasons for this?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who helped them with this research?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How did they help?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How did they collect the bacteria?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Were they the first to do a study like this?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 123, "span_text": "Ashleigh Fraser and Leah Guskjolen, both 18, wondered why they would not be allowed to wear nail polish or artificial nails", "input_text": "why they were not allowed to wear nail polish", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 283, "span_end": 292, "span_text": "the teens", "input_text": "teens", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 34, "span_text": "Ashleigh Fraser and Leah Guskjolen", "input_text": "Ashleigh Fraser and Leah Guskjolen", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "Ashleigh Fraser and Leah Guskjolen, both 18, wondered why they would not be allowed to wear nail polish or artificial nails during their training to become certified nursing assistants", "input_text": "certified nursing assistants", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 2236, "span_end": 2265, "span_text": "Leah, who wants to be a nurse", "input_text": "nurse", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 7, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1005, "span_end": 1057, "span_text": "Leah and Ashleigh had their answer to the question.

Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. \n\nPrior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was inhabited by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, which led to nominal independence as a \"de facto\" United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established a dictatorship under the leadership of Fidel Castro.

School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\" Linguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps, we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway.

It is a department of the University of Oxford and is governed by a group of 15 academics appointed by the vice-chancellor known as the delegates of the press. They are headed by the secretary to the delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University has used a similar system to oversee OUP since the 17th century. \n\nThe university became involved in the print trade around 1480, and grew into a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works. OUP took on the project that became the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in the late 19th century, and expanded to meet the ever-rising costs of the work. As a result, the last hundred years has seen Oxford publish children's books, school text books, music, journals, the World's Classics series, and a best-selling range of English language teaching texts to match its academic and religious titles.

This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses. For example, John Locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone. Similarly Robert Boyle, a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas. The main continental rationalists (Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz) were also advocates of the empirical \"scientific method\". \n\nAristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality, and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active nous. These notions contrasted with Platonic notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's Phaedo and Apology, as well as others). Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than Plato, and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as \"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\" (Latin for \"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\").", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where does their knowledge come from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is this generally contrasted with?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what is that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what is Aristotle's explanation?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "based on what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "was Plato's position more important?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how did commentators summarize this?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what is that in Latin?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what wasn't emipiricist?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who had knowledge of God's existence?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 134, "span_text": "Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.", "input_text": "one's sense-based experience", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 135, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism", "input_text": "rationalism", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 173, "span_end": 269, "span_text": "rationalism, which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses.", "input_text": "knowledge may be derived from reason independent of senses", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 647, "span_end": 884, "span_text": "Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality, and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active nous.", "input_text": "experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active nous", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 647, "span_end": 803, "span_text": "Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality", "input_text": "his theory of potentiality and actuality", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1106, "span_end": 1196, "span_text": "Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than Plato,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1197, "span_end": 1390, "span_text": "and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as \"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\" (Latin for \"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\").", "input_text": "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1268, "span_end": 1390, "span_text": "\"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\" (Latin for \"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\").", "input_text": "nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 647, "span_end": 723, "span_text": "Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist", "input_text": "Aristotle's explanation", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "EmpiricismEmpiricism_ef8d4925df934693174458e6ac76983d110138cc015372e19719ca23"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "30lsnf239uvf8rmwhxn3eiyt4e82ic", "filename": "British_IslesBritish_Isles_0044fe03f2c9ec188834c2ccccf1f8c318f10d7cb93a26225815b576", "story": "The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km2, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. \n\nThe oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old. During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres (4,409 ft), and Lough Neagh, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers 390 square kilometres (151 sq mi). The climate is temperate marine, with mild winters and warm summers. The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest, although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation, by 12,000 BC when Great Britain was still a peninsula of the European continent. Ireland, which became an island by 12,000 BC, was not inhabited until after 8000 BC.

Along with London's West End theatre, Broadway theatre is widely considered to represent the highest level of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world. \n\nThe Theater District is a popular tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2016\u20132017 season (which ended May 21, 2017), total attendance was 13,270,343 and Broadway shows had US$1,449,399,149 in grosses, with attendance down 0.4%, grosses up 5.5%, and playing weeks down 4.1%. \n\nThe great majority of Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues, \"'Broadway musicals,' culminating in the productions of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture\" and helped make New York City the cultural capital of the nation. \n\nNew York did not have a significant theatre presence until about 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street, which held about 280 people. They presented Shakespeare plays and ballad operas such as \"The Beggar's Opera\". In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and opened with \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"The Anatomist\". The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like \"Damon and Phillida\". The Revolutionary War suspended theatre in New York, but thereafter theatre resumed in 1798, the year the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street (now called Park Row). The Bowery Theatre opened in 1826, followed by others. Blackface minstrel shows, a distinctly American form of entertainment, became popular in the 1830s, and especially so with the arrival of the Virginia Minstrels in the 1840s.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many theatres are on Broadway?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many seats do they have?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What city are they in?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "in what Burrough?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is it a popular place?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was the attendance in 2016-2017?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did it gross?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was attendance up?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Down by how much?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Was the gross down too?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "up by what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Were the playing weeks up?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Down by what?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What makes up the majority of the shows?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who is one of the influential producers?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "and another?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What city is the cultural capital?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What was created on Nassau Street?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How many did it hold?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what happened in 1752?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 36, "span_end": 126, "span_text": "Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional theatres ", "input_text": "41", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 125, "span_end": 148, "span_text": " with 500 or more seats", "input_text": "500 or more seats", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 148, "span_end": 252, "span_text": " located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.", "input_text": "in New York City.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 164, "span_end": 238, "span_text": "Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, ", "input_text": "Manhattan", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 415, "span_end": 467, "span_text": "The Theater District is a popular tourist attraction", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 521, "span_end": 604, "span_text": "or the 2016\u20132017 season (which ended May 21, 2017), total attendance was 13,270,343", "input_text": "13,270,343", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 609, "span_end": 655, "span_text": "Broadway shows had US$1,449,399,149 in grosses", "input_text": "$1,449,399,149", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 658, "span_end": 683, "span_text": "ith attendance down 0.4%,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 657, "span_end": 683, "span_text": "with attendance down 0.4%,", "input_text": "0.4%", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 700, "span_text": "grosses up 5.5%,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 692, "span_end": 700, "span_text": "up 5.5%,", "input_text": "5.5%", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 705, "span_end": 728, "span_text": "playing weeks down 4.1%", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 704, "span_end": 730, "span_text": " playing weeks down 4.1%.

For us, we've got to make time. We're in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I've got to make it. \n\n\"We've got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer's strong.

I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do. The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen. Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare come close. But today, he took advantage of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed his fear of the storm. That's when it hit me. As men, we face all kinds of storms. They come in unannounced. Sometimes we stay in a corner or under the blankets, hoping it will all pass. However, if you dare put your head out, you'll discover there're people doing what they must to get what they must have out of life.

Firstly it is the dynamic evolutionary process that fits a population of organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. Thirdly, it is a phenotypic or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has been evolved by natural selection. \n\nOrganisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they grow, and show adaptive plasticity as traits develop in response to the imposed conditions. This gives them resilience to varying environments. \n\nAdaptation is an observable fact of life accepted by philosophers and natural historians from ancient times, independently of their views on evolution, but their explanations differed. Empedocles did not believe that adaptation required a final cause (~ purpose), but \"came about naturally, since such things survived.\" Aristotle did believe in final causes, but assumed that species were fixed. \n\nIn natural theology, adaptation was interpreted as the work of a deity and as evidence for the existence of God. William Paley believed that organisms were perfectly adapted to the lives they led, an argument that shadowed Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who had argued that God had brought about \"the best of all possible worlds.\" Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss is a parody of this optimistic idea, and David Hume also argued against design.

The old man, though he turned the matter much in his mind,--doubting whether the hopes thus raised would not add to Hester's sorrow should they not ultimately be realised,--decided that he could not keep her in the dark. Her belief could not be changed by any statement which Shand might make. Her faith was so strong that no evidence could shake it,--or confirm it. But there would, no doubt, arise in her mind a hope of liberation if any new evidence against the Australian marriage were to reach her; which hope might so probably be delusive! But he knew her to be strong to endure as well as strong to hope, and therefore he told her at once. Then Mr. Seely returned to Cambridge, and all the facts of Shand's deposition were made known at Folking. 'That will get him out at once, of course,' said Hester, triumphantly, as soon as she heard it. But the Squire was older and more cautious, and still doubted. He explained that Dick Shand was not a man who by his simple word would certainly convince a Secretary of State;--that deceit might be suspected;--that a fraudulent plot would be possible; and that very much care was necessary before a convicted prisoner would be released. \n\n'I am quite sure, from Mr. Seely's manner, that he thinks I have bribed the young man,' said Caldigate.

Once, either the spirit of imitation, or his usual desire of showing himself off, made him break in when Sam was knitting his brows frightfully over a sum in proportion.

Duhan de Jandun, a young French gentleman, family-tutor to General Count Dohna (a cousin of our Minister Dohna's), but fonder of fighting than of teaching grammar; whom Friedrich Wilhelm found doing soldier's work in the trenches, and liked the ways of; he, as the foundation-stone of tutorage, is to be first mentioned. And then Count Fink von Finkenstein, a distinguished veteran, high in command (of whose qualities as Head-Tutor, or occasional travelling guardian Friedrich Wilhelm had experience in his own young days [_Biographisches Lexikon aaler Helden und Militairpersonen, welche sich in Preussischen Diensten berumht gemacht haben_ (4 vols.

His Grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on his Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected; at any rate, Esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him. \n\nOther gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and promises to Colonel Esmond.

He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Berm\u00fadez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago.

Gold medal performances require some serious nutrition. Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? \n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. \n\nCrazy Calorie Count \n\n_ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. \n\nAthletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day. \n\nSnacking Secrets \n\nSome athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. \n\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. \n\nFoods for Recovery \n\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? \n\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is nutrition important to athletes?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who founded Nutritious Life Meals?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who ate 12,000 calories a day?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many did he expend during training?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How many bananas would Blake eat?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What's a good tip if you feel shaky?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is Lochte an athlete?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which sport?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he eliminate from his diet?", "turn_id": 9}], "answers": [{"span_start": 93, "span_end": 110, "span_text": "serious nutrition", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 195, "span_end": 209, "span_text": "Keri Glassman,", "input_text": "Keri Glassman,", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 473, "span_text": "Michael Phelps", "input_text": "Michael Phelps", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 556, "span_end": 571, "span_text": "12,000 calories", "input_text": "12,000 calories", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1188, "span_end": 1190, "span_text": "16", "input_text": "16", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1383, "span_end": 1389, "span_text": " honey", "input_text": "honey", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1555, "span_text": "swimme", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1553, "span_text": "swim", "input_text": "swimming", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1729, "span_end": 1755, "span_text": " junk food, candy and soda", "input_text": "junk food, candy and soda", "turn_id": 9}], "name": "high3446.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3uj1cz6izhpw128f4sjfgr7swqk5sy", "filename": "mc500.train.146", "story": "Tony was at home and making dinner.

The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others. \n\nMembers of American colonial society argued the position of \"no taxation without representation\", starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the burning of the \"Gaspee\" in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories. \n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.", "questions": [{"input_text": "when was the burning of the Gaspee?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "where did the British to destroy Colonial military supplies?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "did this escalate into a global conflict?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what were some of the countries that were involved?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who argued for \"no taxation without representation\"?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what act was central to argument?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "when was that enacted?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what was the American Revolution?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who allied with the colonials?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what followed the burning of the Gaspee?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what did the patriots destroy?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "when did the party take place?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "did the British rescind Massachusetts right to self govern?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "how did they do this?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what did the patriots do in 1774?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "did everyone join them?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what were these loyalists called?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who declared the colonies free?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "on what day?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 644, "span_end": 648, "span_text": "1772", "input_text": "1772", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1417, "span_end": 1421, "span_text": "1775", "input_text": "1775", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1386, "span_end": 1407, "span_text": "Lexington and Concord", "input_text": "Lexington and Concord", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1441, "span_end": 1468, "span_text": "developed into a global war", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1513, "span_end": 1528, "span_text": "French, Spanish", "input_text": "France and Spain", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 306, "span_end": 342, "span_text": "Members of American colonial society", "input_text": "Members of American colonial society", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 418, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "the Stamp Act ", "input_text": "the Stamp Act", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 444, "span_end": 448, "span_text": "1765", "input_text": "1765", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 27, "span_end": 45, "span_text": " a colonial revolt", "input_text": "a colonial revolt", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 285, "span_end": 292, "span_text": "France ", "input_text": "France", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 661, "span_end": 682, "span_text": " the Boston Tea Party", "input_text": "the Boston Tea Party", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 723, "span_end": 751, "span_text": " a consignment of taxed tea.", "input_text": "a consignment of taxed tea.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 686, "span_end": 690, "span_text": "1773", "input_text": "1773", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 866, "span_end": 929, "span_text": "rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 818, "span_end": 848, "span_text": " a series of legislative acts ", "input_text": "a series of legislative acts", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1017, "span_end": 1057, "span_text": "set up their own alternative government ", "input_text": "set up their own alternative government", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1126, "span_end": 1222, "span_text": "other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1222, "span_end": 1228, "span_text": "Tories", "input_text": "Tories", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1880, "span_end": 1904, "span_text": "The Continental Congress", "input_text": "The Continental Congress", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 2066, "span_end": 2079, "span_text": "July 2, 1776.", "input_text": "July 2, 1776.", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "American_Revolution.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "34bbwhlwhab1k7k3vhca2pei8wewil", "filename": "Kosovo.txt", "story": "Kosovo (; , or \"Kosov\u00eb\"; ) is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeastern Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. \n\nKosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula.

At first he had imagined he had lost it fairly enough, but after thoughts, coupled with what he heard on the sly the next day, made him certain that Stillwater had cheated him. \n\nHe had brought his case to Pawnee Brown, and the leader of the boomers at once concluded that the gambler had not acted fairly. He had met Stillwater at Wichita, where the gambler's reputation was far from savory. \n\n\"You were a fool to bet at cards, Cal,\" he said flatly. \"But that is no reason why Stillwater should cheat you. I'll do what I can, but you must promise to leave playing for high stakes alone in the future.\" \n\n\"Don't yer fear, Pawnee,\" was Clemmer's ready reply. \"A scorched Injun keeps hez distance from the blaze, don't he?

A member of the Republican Party, he was previously a congressman, ambassador, and Director of Central Intelligence. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. Previously known as simply \"George Bush\", since 2001, Bush has often been referred to as \"George H. W. Bush\", \"Bush 41\", \"Bush the Elder\", or \"George Bush Senior\" to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. \n\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until the end of the war, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas and entered the oil business, becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. Bush became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company, and he won election to the House of Representatives in 1966. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and in 1973, Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed Bush as the ambassador to the People's Republic of China, and later reassigned Bush to the position of Director of Central Intelligence.

With all his penetration he did not, however, find out that the matter which called most for consideration was the financial part of the scheme--in other words, how to accomplish the end desired with extremely limited means. He solved the question for them, however, by asserting that he intended to give all the scholars of all the Sunday-schools in the neighbourhood a treat, and of course meant to include Netta's school among the rest-- unless, of course, she possessed so much exclusive pride as to refuse to join him. \n\nThere was no resisting Captain Lee.

Before his accession to the throne, he served as heir apparent and held the title of Prince of Wales for longer than any of his predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother. \n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, was poor. The Edwardian era, which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism.

While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter). \n\nThe discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant.

There was to be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended. \n\nMarian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some people--her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance-- should mind it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he had known her for a year.

As we were talking, she said, \"I just wish I had meaningful work. I don't feel like I am making a difference. I am just wasting my life.\" This is the theme I hear most often from clients who have been in the workforce awhile.All of us want to feel like we are making a difference. We want to believe our work means something. The problem comes in defining \"meaningful work\". What is it? That answer is different for everyone. For some meaningful work might be helping others organize their office. For others it may mean making a million dollars. \n\nWhat really matters is how you see it. What is meaningful work to you? Take out a piece of paper and answer these questions. How do you define meaningful work? When do you feel like you are really making a difference? What work have you done so far that feels the most meaningful? Write down whatever comes to mind. \n\nWhat you want to do is meaningful. It is very easy to start judging yourself as being selfish. Stop! Allow yourself to be honest. The fact is when Picasso painted; he was doing it because he liked to paint. He was not thinking, \"Oh, I hope this brings joy to others' lives.\" He painted because he wanted to. When Beethoven composed, he did it because he loved music. Even scientists searching for a cure for cancer are immersed in their work because it fascinates them. \n\nDon't look down on your work. It is easy to _ the importance of work that feels meaningful. I remember Tony Robbins told a story of talking with the owner of a major company. The man said to Tony, \"I wish I could do what you do because it makes such adifference in people's lives\". Tony said, \"You have got to be kidding! Look at what adifference you make. You provide work, health insurance and security for thousands ofpeople!\" Don't underestimate the value you provide. \n\nTake a look at what you have written about meaningful work. Do you see any themes? How do you wish to contribute to this world? Whatever you choose, remember that the greatest gift you can give is to find work that makes you feel fulfilled and delighted.

The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away. \n\nMr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the garden gate, good man!

Jimmy had been thinking things over. He was one of those men who are at their best in a losing game. Imminent disaster always had the effect of keying him up and putting an edge on his mind. The news he had heard that night had left him with undiminished determination, but conscious that a change of method would be needed. He must stake all on a single throw now. Young Lochinvar rather than Romeo must be his model. He declined to believe himself incapable of getting anything that he wanted as badly as he wanted Molly. He also declined to believe that she was really attached to Lord Dreever. He suspected the hand of McEachern in the affair, though the suspicion did not clear up the mystery by any means. Molly was a girl of character, not a feminine counterpart of his lordship, content meekly to do what she was told in a matter of this kind. The whole thing puzzled him. \n\n\"Well, Spike?\" he said. \n\nHe was not too pleased at the interruption. He was thinking, and he wanted to be alone. \n\nSomething appeared to have disturbed Spike. His bearing was excited. \n\n\"Say, boss! Guess what. You know dat guy dat come dis afternoon--de guy from de village, dat came wit' old man McEachern?\" \n\n\"Galer?\" said Jimmy. \"What about him?\" \n\nThere had been an addition to the guests at the castle that afternoon. Mr. McEachern, walking in the village, had happened upon an old New York acquaintance of his, who, touring England, had reached Dreever and was anxious to see the historic castle. Mr. McEachern had brought him thither, introduced him to Sir Thomas, and now Mr. Samuel Galer was occupying a room on the same floor as Jimmy's. He had appeared at dinner that night, a short, wooden-faced man, with no more conversation than Hargate. Jimmy had paid little attention to the newcomer.

Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first several nickelodeons. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed.

Teka Not too many people know what to do when someone has a heart attack other than call 911.But Teka, an Australian Cattle Dog, skipped the phone call when her owner suffered a severe heart attack.Not only did she bark in his face to bring him back to consciousness and run outside barking to attract attention, but she climbed on his chest and jumped up and down. When medics arrived, they couldn't say whether or not Teka's unusual version of CPR had any effect, but her owner feels grateful to her.And her efforts didn't go unnoticed: Teka was given a Purple Cross medal for bravery by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Zoey Size is no barrier to a dog determined to protect her family and Zoey, a 5-pound chihuahua puppy from Colorado, is living proof. She made headlines in 2007 after saving a one-year-old from the bite of a large rattlesnake. Zoey, who weighed only five pounds, was just 10 months old at the time, but she rose to the occasion when needed.One-year-old Booker West was playing in his grandparent's backyard when a rattlesnake struck at him! Zoey sprang into action, putting herself between the snake and the kid.She got several snakebites and was rushed to an animal hospital.Her head swelled and she almost lost an eye, but with proper treatment, Zoey made a full recovery. Hachiko Hachiko, an Akita, was brought to Tokyo in 1924 by Ueno, a college professor. Every day Hachiko waited for him to return from work, meeting him at the train station at four. The following year, Ueno suffered a stroke at work and died.Unaware of his death, the dog still returned to the train station every day to await his owner.He became such a familiar presence there, in fact, that the station master set out food for the dog and gave him a bed in the station.Even so, every day at four, he hopefully waited by the tracks as the train pulled in, searching through the crowd for his master.Every day.For ten years. Upon his death in 1935, Hachiko was a national celebrity and a bronze statue of him was installed at Shibuya Station as a tribute. Stubby In 1917 Stubby was adopted by a soldier, who trained him to drill and salute. His owner developed such a strong connection with him that when he was sent to war in Europe, he took Stubby along, hiding him on the ship bound for France. Stubby proved a war star.He served 18 months in the front lines and took part in seventeen battles.He kept watch, warned the soldiers of surprise attacks, and saved the wounded in no man's land.He once found a German spy and held him by the seat of the pants until American soldiers arrived.

First, some people admire and imitate stars because they allow themselves to be influenced by the media. Television, radio, and magazines invade the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group.

His mother added, \"It makes me feel like our world is going in a good direction with this next generation.\" In all, Neidorf gave $13,000 to Operation Mend. He also encouraged his friends to donate to the cause. He is the organization's youngest donor so far. Operation Mend is a privately funded program that works in partnership with the UCLA Medical Center. Ron Katz, a board member at the hospital, started the program in 2006 after seeing a TV programme about Aaron Mankin, a veteran who had gone through dozens of surgeries after a fight in Iraq which completely burned off his face. Mankin ended up being Operation Mend's first patient, starting the first of 20 reconstructive facial surgeries at UCLA in Sept. 2007. In a 2011 interview, Katz shared how his experience of helping Mankin made him realize the need to establish a more permanent program. \"My wife and I soon realized that there were dozens of Aarons out there,\" Katz said. \"They deserve the best that we offer them.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What charity did Joshue Neidorf donate to?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's it for?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How much did he give?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What made him donate?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What were the Neidorfs to Dahlman?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Neidorf gave thirteen thousand to who?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is it publicly funded?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who started the program?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who was the first patient?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many surgiest happened in Sept 2007?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 897, "span_end": 943, "span_text": "In all, Neidorf gave $13,000 to Operation Mend", "input_text": "Operation Mend", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 234, "span_end": 306, "span_text": " a program that reconstructs the faces of severely burned U.

Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries. \n\nIn biology, manganese(II) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants.

In the mean time Nina had told the story of her love to her father, and the effect on Balatka had simply been that he had not got out of his bed since. For himself he would have cared, perhaps, but little as to the Jewish marriage, had he not known that those belonging to him would have cared so much. He had no strong religious prejudice of his own, nor indeed had he strong feeling of any kind. He loved his daughter, and wished her well; but even for her he had been unable to exert himself in his younger days, and now simply expected from her hands all the comfort which remained to him in this world. The priest he knew would attack him, and to the priest he would be able to make no answer. But to Trendellsohn, Jew as he was, he would trust in worldly matters, rather than to the Zamenoys; and were it not that he feared the Zamenoys, and could not escape from his close connection with them, he would have been half inclined to let the girl marry the Jew. Souchey, indeed, had frightened him on the subject when it had first been mentioned to him; and Nina, coming with her own assurance so quickly after Souchey's suspicion, had upset him; but his feeling in regard to Nina had none of that bitter anger, no touch of that abhorrence which animated the breast of his sister-in-law. When Ziska came to him he was alone in his bedroom. Ziska had heard the news, as had all the household in the Windberg-gasse, and had come over to his uncle's house to see what he could do, by his own diplomacy, to put an end to an engagement which was to him doubly calamitous. \"Uncle Josef,\" he said, sitting by the old man's bed, \"have you heard what Nina is doing?\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "who had Nina visited?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who is her dad?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "did he love his daughter?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did the News Nina give him have a positive effect?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what happened?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "where did Ziska go?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "who would attack Balatka?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "would he be able to explain things to the priest?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what was the person Nina wanted to marry?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who was it because of that he greed to the relationship?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what did they do to him?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "was he able to leave them?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who had warned him about the marriage before Nina?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "was he with anyone when Ziska came?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what Balatka expect from Nina?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "did everybody know what was going on?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "where was the household?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what did he call his uncle?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what did he want to help with?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "why?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 52, "span_end": 62, "span_text": " her aunt,", "input_text": "her aunt,", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 125, "span_end": 132, "span_text": "Balatka", "input_text": "Balatka", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 532, "span_end": 555, "span_text": "He loved his daughter, ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 202, "span_end": 286, "span_text": "and the effect on Balatka had simply been that he had not got out of his bed since.

When the season's work is over and the prairie bound fast by iron frost, the man whom it has prospered spends his well-earned leisure visiting his neighbors or lounging contentedly beside the stove; but those oppressed by anxieties find the compulsory idleness irksome, and I counted the days until we could commence again in the spring. The goodwill of my neighbors made this possible, for one promised seed-wheat, to be paid for when harvest was gathered in; another placed surplus stock under my charge on an agreement to share the resultant profit, while Haldane sent a large draft of young horses and cattle he had hardly hands enough to care for, under a similar arrangement. \n\nI accepted these offers the more readily because, while prompted by kindness, the advantages were tolerably equal to all concerned. So the future looked slightly brighter, and I hoped that better times would come, if we could hold out sufficiently long. The debt I still owed Lane, however, hung as a menace over me, while although--doubtless because it suited him--he did not press me for payment, the extortionate interest was adding to it constantly. Some of my neighbors were in similar circumstances, and at times we conferred together as to the best means of mutual protection. \n\nIn the meantime the fire at Gaspard's Trail was almost forgotten--or so, at least, it seemed. Haldane, much against his wishes, spent most of the winter at Bonaventure; but his elder daughter remained in Montreal. Boone, the photographer, appeared but once, and spent the night with us.

On the other hand, they also long to connect with other kids, and they can't find other kids like themselves.\" As Haimovitz got older, he became frustrated. He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls. \"When you start that early, you suddenly start to grow up in public, and I wanted to experiment,\" Haimovitz says. So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffee houses. He played Bach, Haydn and Hendrix. \"My teacher was Leonard Rose, and we never played any 20th-century music. He didn't like it.

It includes twelve sovereign states (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela), a part of France (French Guiana), and a non-sovereign area (the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory though this is disputed by Argentina).

And the incident was similar to other attacks reported by boaters on Falcon Lake, about 70 miles west of the Hartley's home in McAllen. \n\nGonzalez has said the gunmen are typically teenagers hired by a drug cartel in the neighboring Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

Bentley was a little brown puppy and he was always getting into trouble. One day Bentley got outside and walked down the street. He found a trash can and started to dig through it. A cat came also to see what Bentley was doing. \"Excuse me, but what are you looking for?\" asked the cat. \"Well, nothing important,\" Bentley told the cat. \"I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there.\" The cat told Bentley that his name was Felix and asked if he could dig through the trash too. \"Sure thing\" Bentley told the cat. The two of them started to dig through the trash again. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going away from Bentley's house.

Anybody who's got that amount of money that they need to go and commission a special boat to keep them entertained -- I think it's nuts,\" he says. \n\n\"The key with these people is they want to be different, and they want to be separate, and they want to be distinctive -- and that impulse throws good taste, and reason, and rationale out the window.\" \n\nRags to riches ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What kind of car does Gino have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what did he model after the car?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what color?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How much is the care worth?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how much is the boat worth?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what is it considered?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what else?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "who had negative comments about the boat?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who is he?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what did he say?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "meaning what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how often does the boat go in the water?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "any other negative comments?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 88, "span_end": 99, "span_text": " Lamborghin", "input_text": "Lamborghin", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 119, "span_text": "Lamborghini-inspired speedboat", "input_text": "speedboat", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 311, "span_end": 344, "span_text": "his banana-yellow beauties in tow", "input_text": "banana-yellow", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 365, "span_end": 377, "span_text": "$750,000 car", "input_text": "$750,000", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 205, "span_end": 227, "span_text": "$1.1 million price tag", "input_text": "$1.1 million", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 473, "span_end": 502, "span_text": "it's the Lamborghini of boats", "input_text": "the Lamborghini of boats", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 74, "span_end": 155, "span_text": "this 15-meter, Lamborghini-inspired speedboat is the apex of nautical engineering", "input_text": "the apex of nautical engineering", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 856, "span_end": 987, "span_text": "To Quentin Willson, former presenter of BBC TV show \"Top Gear,\" the Lamborghini boat is a tasteless display of wealth that screams:", "input_text": "Quentin Willson", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 859, "span_end": 919, "span_text": "Quentin Willson, former presenter of BBC TV show \"Top Gear,\"", "input_text": "former presenter of BBC TV show \"Top Gear,\"", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 973, "span_end": 1009, "span_text": " that screams: \"I'm rich and bored.\"", "input_text": "\"I'm rich and bored.\"", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 987, "span_text": "tasteless display of wealth that screams:", "input_text": "its a tasteless display of wealth", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 702, "span_end": 741, "span_text": "the boat's never even been in the water", "input_text": "never", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1072, "span_end": 1243, "span_text": "\"And that's really sad.

I think it is not unconnected with successful litigation in Australia that has resulted in a multi-million dollar settlement for a hitherto unrecognized thalidomide survivor, Lynette Rowe.

The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsa\u00df-Lothringen).The German conquest of France and the unification of Germany upset the European balance of power, that had existed since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and Otto von Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades. French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war, along with British apprehension about the balance of power, became factors in the causes of World War I. \n\nThe Ems telegram had exactly the effect on French public opinion that Bismarck had intended. \"This text produced the effect of a red flag on the Gallic bull\", Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt \"he had just received a slap\". The leader of the monarchists in Parliament, Adolphe Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian.

We had dined, and the bright sunshine and spring-like mildness of the weather had lured us out upon the terrace. Yvonne and Genevi\u00e8ve occupied the stone seat. Andrea had perched himself upon the granite balustrade, and facing them he sat, swinging his shapely legs to and fro as he chatted merrily, whilst on either side of him stood the Chevalier de Canaples and I. \n\n\"If M. de Luynes be as great a wizard in other things as with the sword, then, pardieu, he is a fearful magician,\" said Canaples. \n\nI bowed, yet not so low but that I detected a sneer on Yvonne's lips. \n\n\"So, pretty lady,\" said I to myself, \"we shall see if presently your lip will curl when I show you something of my wizard's art.\" \n\nAnd presently my chance came. M. de Canaples found reason to leave us, and no sooner was he gone than Genevi\u00e8ve remembered that she had that day discovered a budding leaf upon one of the rose bushes in the garden below.

In truth, however, he was more than this, since not only did he fashion and trade in costly things; he lent out moneys to interest upon security to great people who needed it, and even to the king Richard and his Court. Also he owned ships and did much commerce with Holland, France, yes, and with Spain and Italy. Indeed, although he appeared so humble, his wealth was very large and always increased, like a snowball rolling down a hill; moreover, he owned much land, especially in the neighbourhood of London where it was likely to grow in value. \n\n\"Money melts,\" he would say, \"furs corrupt with moth and time, and thieves break in and steal. But land--if the title be good--remains. Therefore buy land, which none can carry away, near to a market or a growing town if may be, and hire it out to fools to farm, or sell it to other fools who wish to build great houses and spend their goods in feeding a multitude of idle servants.

Still, his parents had tried to give him as normal a life as possible and had sent him to St. Theresa's Elementary School. At the age of 12, Jeremy was only in second grade, seemingly unable to learn. His teacher, Doris Miller, often became angry with him. He would often disturb the class by squirming in his seat, drooling and making grunting noises. Doris had 18 other youngsters to teach and she didn't want to waste time on Jeremy. Spring came, and the children talked excitedly about the coming of Easter. Doris told them of the story of Jesus, and stressed the idea of new life springing forth, she gave each of them a large plastic egg. \"Now,\" she said to them, \"I want you to take this home and bring it back tomorrow with something inside that shows new life. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, Miss Miller!\" All the children responded except Jeremy. He just listened, his eyes never left her face. He did not even make his usual noises. The next morning, the children came to school and placed their eggs in a large basket on Doris' desk. After they completed their Math lesson, it was time to open the eggs. In the first egg, Doris found a flower. \"Oh yes, a flower is certainly a sign of new life,\" she said. The next egg had a plastic beautiful butterfly in it. Then Doris opened the fourth egg. It was empty! Surely it must be Jeremy's she thought, and he did not understand the instructions. She put that egg down so she wouldn't embarrass him.

Hetta understood perfectly that she was in this matter stronger than her mother and that she need fear nothing, now that Roger Carbury was on her side. 'I don't know what you mean to live on,' Lady Carbury said, threatening future evils in a plaintive tone. Hetta repeated, though in other language, the assurance which the young lady made who declared that if her future husband would consent to live on potatoes, she would be quite satisfied with the potato-peelings; while Paul made some vague allusion to the satisfactory nature of his final arrangements with the house of Fisker, Montague, and Montague. 'I don't see anything like an income,' said Lady Carbury; 'but I suppose Roger will make it right. He takes everything upon himself now it seems.' But this was before the halcyon day of Mr Broune's second offer. \n\nIt was at any rate decided that they were to be married, and the time fixed for the marriage was to be the following spring. When this was finally arranged Roger Carbury, who had returned to his own home, conceived the idea that it would be well that Hetta should pass the autumn and if possible the winter also down in Suffolk, so that she might get used to him in the capacity which he now aspired to fill; and with that object he induced Mrs Yeld, the Bishop's wife, to invite her down to the palace.

Jodi Rell, a Republican. \n\nCapital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. \n\nSince then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. \n\nMichael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals.

When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'.

He is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century, attracting both praise and controversy for his work and his outspoken public persona. \n\nRaised in Chicago, West briefly attended art school before becoming known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread commercial and critical success, and founded record label GOOD Music. He went on to explore a variety of different musical styles on subsequent albums that included the baroque-inflected Late Registration (2005), the arena-inspired Graduation (2007), and the starkly polarizing 808s & Heartbreak (2008).

Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \"There are a lot of things kids do,\" he says. \"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \"It' s good to ask for help,\" he says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who can't deny his buddies something?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What do they feel pressured about?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who is Ubayd?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where from?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did he copy off a peers paper?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did happen?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did he let this happen?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How did he react?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he confront the cheater?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When does cheating usually begin?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Do one in four kids admit to it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How many do?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Which student is from Ware, MA?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does he think cheating is okay?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Have his friends tried to cheat off of him?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What grade is he in?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What does he tell his friends who want to cheat?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who is Michael josephson?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who does he think students should turn to?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 804, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "But many kids find it hard to say no", "input_text": "many kids", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1132, "span_end": 1224, "span_text": "a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.", "input_text": "cheating", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 12, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "Ubayd Steed, a sixth grader ", "input_text": "a sixth grader", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 25, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "a sixth grader in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,", "input_text": "Philadelphia", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 204, "span_end": 258, "span_text": "Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 98, "span_end": 176, "span_text": " he noticed a classmate looking at his paper. \" I quickly turned my paper over", "input_text": "a classmate looked at his paper", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 145, "span_end": 176, "span_text": " I quickly turned my paper over", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 145, "span_end": 177, "span_text": " I quickly turned my paper over,", "input_text": "he turned over his paper", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 187, "span_end": 258, "span_text": " Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 452, "span_end": 490, "span_text": "he behavior starts in the lower grades", "input_text": "in lower grades", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 510, "span_end": 533, "span_text": "one in three elementary", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 510, "span_end": 562, "span_text": "one in three elementary students admits to cheating.", "input_text": "one in three", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 562, "span_end": 615, "span_text": " Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts", "input_text": "Jacob Harder", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 757, "span_end": 804, "span_text": "encourages his classmates to do it themselves.

Pennsylvania, was arrested Thursday on a federal charge of attempted arson in the town of Thorndale on January 25, authorities said. \n\nGilliam was arrested at his residence without incident, according to the task force. \n\nGilliam is expected to have his initial appearance on Friday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\nRoger Leon Barlow, 19, of Downingtown,

Actor Zachary Quinto, known for playing Spock in the 2009 \"Star Trek\" remake and his role as Sylar on the television show \"Heroes,\" acknowledged his homosexuality in a post on his website Sunday,

deeply troubled,\" Quinto posted. \"But when I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer had made an 'It Gets Better' video only months before taking his own life -- I felt indescribable despair. \n\n\"I also

clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality.\" \n\nRodemeyer was found dead September 18 outside his parents' home in Buffalo, New York. His parents said he had experienced years of bullying over his sexual orientation. His suicide has attracted the attention of such stars as Lady Gaga, who dedicated a song to him at a recent concert. \n\nThe \"It Gets Better\" campaign is aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered youth who may experience bullying. \n\n\"Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country,\" Quinto said. \"Gay kids need to stop killing themselves because they are made to feel worthless by cruel and relentless bullying.

He says that humanity is currently at point of breakthrough in war, like the discovery of the atomic bomb. \"What does it mean to go to war with US soldiers whose hardware is made in China and whose software is made in India?\" The research predicts that by 2015 American soldiers will be half robots, half humans. It is worth mentioning that attack drones and bomb-handling robots are just some of the devices that armies use in battles. Besides having no mercy in battle, robots, in contrast to humans, also cut off living soldiers from horrors. \"The United States is ahead in military robots, but in technology there is no such thing as a permanent advantage,\" Mr. Singer said, adding that currently Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran are working on the development of military robots as well. The researcher mentioned that robotics is something terrorists can take advantage of as well. \"You don't have to make robots believe they are going to get 7 million dollars when they die to get them to blow themselves up,\" he said. In addition, Mr. Singer mentioned that military robots feature cameras that record everything a machine sees, providing digital video that is uploaded on You Tubein graphic clips, which soldiers call \"war porn\". \"It turns war into entertainment, sometimes set to music. The ability to watch more but experience less,\" he said. David Hansco, who is a robotics designer, creates robots that have more features of a human. For example, his robots feature synthetic flesh faces and have the ability to read human facial expressions and copy them.

The most commonly known Crusades are the campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Islamic rule but the term \"Crusades\" is also applied to other church-sanctioned campaigns. These were fought for a variety of reasons including the suppression of paganism and heresy, the resolution of conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups, or for political and territorial advantage. At the time of the early Crusades the word did not exist, only becoming the leading descriptive term around 1760. \n\nIn 1095 Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, AlexiosI, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonising Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East\u2013West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church.

the \"American Dream\" .The main character, Willy Loman, believes wholeheartedly in American capitalism, and desires to \"succeed\" but his own greed _ him in the end.Death of a Salesman's first performance was a huge hit on Broadway, where it shocked the American theatre world, and strengthened the 33-year-old Miller's status as a master of American theatre.The play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the Tony Award for Best Play.The New York Times praised Death of a Salesman as a milestone of 20th century theatre.In 1999, Death of a Salesman received another Tony Award for Best Revival, and the then 83-year-old Miller was given the National Medal of Arts. \n\nThe 1983 version of Death of a Salesman was directed personally by Arthur Miller on a visit to China, with Beijing director and actor Ying Ruocheng as the main character of Willy Loman.On May 7, 1983, the play was performed for the first time at the Capital Theatre, and the first series of performances lasted until August 18, with over 50 performances, some of which filled the house, and all of which had great influence. \n\nWhen it was first performed here, China didn't have \"salesman\" , so the actors had to use their imagination to represent the characters and American society, and the audiences weren't entirely sure about some information.For example, they couldn't understand what \"fixed payments\" were, or why, if Willy was a lower-class member of American society, his family had a house, car, refrigerator, and television.But this didn't stop the play from

For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein's day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare. Education is different, too. One essential aspect of Einstein's training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager--Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others, It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time. Einstein was also an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem. Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren't many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical and rewarding efforts. \n\n\"Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,\" said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, \"but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.\" Especially considering what Einstein was promoting. \"The actual structure of space and time bending? My God, what an idea!\" Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. \"It takes a certain type of person who will knock his head against the wall because you believe you'll find the solution.\" Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his \"miracle year\" of 1905.

It lies south of Italy, east of Tunisia, and north of Libya. The country covers just over , with a population of just under 450,000, making it one of the world's smallest and most densely populated countries. The capital of Malta is Valletta, which at 0.8\u00a0km, is the smallest national capital in the European Union by area. Malta has one national language, which is Maltese, and English as an official language. \n\nMalta's location in the middle of the Mediterranean has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, French, and British have ruled the islands. \n\nKing George VI of the United Kingdom awarded the George Cross to Malta in 1942 for the then British colony's bravery in the Second World War. The George Cross continues to appear on Malta's national flag.
