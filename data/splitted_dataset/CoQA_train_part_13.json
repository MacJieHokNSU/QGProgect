It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. \n\nThe code set allows more than 14,400 different codes and permits the tracking of many new diagnoses. The codes can be expanded to over 16,000 codes by using optional sub-classifications. \n\nThe WHO provides detailed information about ICD online, and makes available a set of materials online, such as an ICD-10 online browser, ICD-10 Training, ICD-10 online training, ICD-10 online training support, and study guide materials for download. \n\nThe International version of ICD should not be confused with national modifications of ICD that frequently include much more detail, and sometimes have separate sections for procedures. The US ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), for instance, has some 93,000 codes. The US also has the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS), a coding system that contains 76,000 procedure codes that is not used by other countries. \n\nWork on ICD-10 began in 1983 and was completed in 1992. \n\nThe following is a list of ICD-10 codes. Some 27 countries use ICD-10 for reimbursement and resource allocation in their health system. A few of them have made modifications to ICD to better accommodate this use of ICD-10. The article below makes reference to some of these modifications.

THE ZENITH \n\nAndrea Doria did not remain to make formal surrender of the citadel of Sinigaglia to the duke--for which purpose, be it borne in mind, had Cesare been invited, indirectly, to come to Sinigaglia. He fled during the night that saw Vitelli and Oliverotto writhing their last in the strangler's hands. And his flight adds colour to the versions of the affair that were afforded the world by Cesare and his father. Andrea Doria, waiting to surrender his trust, had nothing to fear from the duke, no reason to do anything but remain. Andrea Doria, intriguing against the duke's life with the condottieri, finding them seized by the duke, and inferring that all was discovered, had every reason to fly. \n\nThe citadel made surrender on that New Year's morning, when Cesare summoned it to do so, whilst the troops of the Orsini and Vitelli lodged in the castles of the territory, being taken unawares, were speedily disposed of. So, there being nothing more left to do in Sinigaglia, Cesare once more marshalled his men and set out for Citt\u00e0 di Castello--the tyranny of the Vitelli, which he found undefended and of which he took possession in the name of the Church. Thence he rushed on towards Perugia, for he had word that Guidobaldo of Urbino, Fabio Orsini, Annibale and Venanzio Varano, and Vitelli's nephew were assembled there under the wing of Gianpaolo Baglioni, who, with a considerable condotta at his back, was making big talk of resisting the Duke of Romagna and Valentinois. In this, Gianpaolo persevered most bravely until he had news that the duke was as near as Gualdo, when precipitately he fled--leaving his guests to shift for themselves. He had remembered, perhaps, at the last moment how narrow an escape he had had of it at Sinigaglia, and he repaired to Siena to join Pandolfo Petrucci, who had been equally fortunate in that connection.

The father of William the Conqueror was Robert, who became subsequently the duke, the sixth in the line. He resided, at the time when William was born, in a great castle at Falaise. Falaise, as will be seen upon the map, is west of Rouen, and it stands, like Rouen, at some distance from the sea. The castle was built upon a hill, at a little distance from the town.

On Friday night a tornado swept through a town north of us called Barrie, killing dozens of people and doing millions of dollars worth of damage. Sunday night, as I was coming home, I stopped the car when I got to Barrie. I got out on the side of the highway and looked around. It was a mess. Everywhere I looked there were smashed houses and cars turned upside down. \n\nThat same night Bob Templeton was driving down the same highway. He stopped to look at the disaster just as I had; only his thoughts were different than my own. Bob was the vice-president of Telemedia Communications, which owns a string of radio stations in Ontario and Quebec. He thought there must be something we could do for these people with the radio stations they had. \n\nThe following night I was doing another seminar in Toronto. Bob Templeton and Bob Johnson, another vice-president from Telemedia, came in and stood in the back of the room. They shared their conviction that there had to be something they could do for the people in Barrie. \n\nAfter the seminar we went back to Bob's office. He was now committed to the idea of helping the people who had been caught in the tornado. \n\nThe following Friday he called all the executives at Telemedia into his office. At the top of a flip chart he wrote three 3s. He said to his executives, \"How would you like to raise 3 million dollars 3 days from now in just 3 hours and give the money to the people in Barrie?\" There was nothing but silence in the room. \n\nFinally someone said, \"Templeton, you're crazy. There is no way we could do that.\" \n\nBob said, \"Wait a minute. I didn't ask you if we could or even if we should. I just asked you if you'd like to.\" \n\nThey all said, \"Sure we'd like to.\" He then drew a large 'T' underneath the 333. On one side he wrote, \"Why we can't.\" On the other side he wrote, \"How we can.\" \n\n\"I'm going to put a big X on the 'Why we can't' side. We're not going to spend any time on the ideas of why we can't. That's of no value. On the other side we're going to write down every idea that we can come up with on how we can. We're not going to leave the room until we figure it out.\" There was silence again. \n\nFinally, someone said, \"We could do a radio show across Canada.\" \n\nBob said, \"That's a great idea,\" and wrote it down. Before he had it written, someone said, \"You can't do a radio show across Canada. We don't have radio stations across Canada.\" That was a pretty valid objection. They only had stations in Ontario and Quebec. \n\nTempleton replied, \" _ .\" But this was a real strong objection because radio stations are not very compatible . They usually don't work together. They are very cutthroat. They fight each other. To get them to work together would be virtually impossible according to the standard way of thinking. \n\nAll of a sudden someone said, \"We could get Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson, the biggest names in Canadian broadcasting, to anchor the show.\" (That would be like getting Tom Brokaw and Sam Donaldson to anchor the show. They are anchors on national TV. They are not going to go on radio.) At that point, it was absolutely amazing how fast and furious the creative ideas began to flow. \n\nThat was on a Friday. The following Tuesday they had a radiothon . They had fifty radio stations all across the country that agreed to broadcast it. It didn't matter who got the credit as long as the people in Barrie got the money. Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson anchored the show and they succeeded in raising three million dollars in three hours within three business days! \n\nYou see, you can do anything if you put your focus on how to do it rather than on why you can't.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Was Bob Templeton driving down the highway during the day?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Which way were cars turned?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is that the way cars are supposed to be?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What happened to the houses?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which town was this in?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did anyone die?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many people?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was there any monetary damages?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How much?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What night was the author driving through Barrie?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was he driving home?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where had he just spent his weekend?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where's that located?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was he doing there?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What swept through Barrie?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who else had been driving down the same highway that night?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What did Bob do for a living?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "For which company?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who was Bob committed to helping?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 452, "span_end": 458, "span_text": "night ", "input_text": "night", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 427, "span_end": 439, "span_text": "upside down.", "input_text": "Upside down.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 359, "span_end": 363, "span_text": "mess", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 396, "span_end": 404, "span_text": "smashed ", "input_text": "They were smashed.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 138, "span_end": 144, "span_text": "Barrie", "input_text": "Barrie.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 146, "span_end": 160, "span_text": "killing dozens", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 154, "span_end": 161, "span_text": "dozens ", "input_text": "Dozens.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 193, "span_end": 201, "span_text": "dollars ", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 181, "span_end": 190, "span_text": "millions ", "input_text": "Millions", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 218, "span_end": 225, "span_text": "Sunday ", "input_text": "Sunday night.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 248, "span_end": 252, "span_text": "home", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 37, "span_end": 52, "span_text": "Deerhurst Lodge", "input_text": "The Deerhurst Lodge", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 63, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "Toronto", "input_text": "North of Toronto", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 22, "span_end": 30, "span_text": "seminar ", "input_text": "A weekend seminar", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 90, "span_end": 98, "span_text": "tornado ", "input_text": "A tornado", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 75, "span_end": 81, "span_text": "Friday", "input_text": "Friday", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 458, "span_end": 471, "span_text": "Bob Templeton", "input_text": "Bob Templeton", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 615, "span_end": 629, "span_text": "vice-president", "input_text": "He was a vice-president.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 633, "span_end": 657, "span_text": "Telemedia Communications", "input_text": "Telemedia Communications", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1191, "span_end": 1198, "span_text": "people ", "input_text": "People who were caught in the tornado", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high8098.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3tu5zicbrd13b4c4am1dxb2ihx4q8b", "filename": "World_Meteorological_Organization.txt", "story": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is an intergovernmental organization with a membership of 191 Member States and Territories.

Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago. \n\nNow, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008. \n\nNot all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don't meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school. \n\nFor small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running. \n\nBut for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. \"They're trying to buy students,\" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum. \n\nStudies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it. \n\n\"As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,\" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17. \n\nMerit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, \"served us well,\" Inzer says, but \"to be discounting the price for families that don't need financial aid doesn't feel right any more.\" \n\nNeed-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level. \n\nBetween 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state's public institutions. \n\nBut in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be \"a sign that people are starting to realize that there's this destructive competition going on,\" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need. \n\nDavid Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors. \n\n\"No one can take one-sided action,\" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, \"This is a merry-go-round that's going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.\" \n\nA complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don't qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs. \n\nThat's one reason Allegheny College doesn't plan to drop merit aid entirely. \n\n\"We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,\" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny's vice president for enrollment. \n\nEmory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program. \n\n\"Yeah, we're playing the merit game,\" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. \"The fact of the matter is, it's not just about the lowest-income people. It's the average American middle-class family who's being priced out of the market.\" \n\nA few words about merit-based aid: \n\nMerit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships. \n\nAcademic merit scholarships are based on students' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. \n\nAthletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee . Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance. \n\nArtistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.", "questions": [{"input_text": "where is the University named after the first president of the US?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is it called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what school in Pennsylvania?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "in what city?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "is there another city named after a former president?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what one?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "in what state?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what is there?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "are they doing something?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "all of them?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what type?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what type will continue to exist?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "when does this policy begin?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "who does dave work for?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what is his position there?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "did he say something?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "where is Emory?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 425, "span_end": 473, "span_text": "George Washington University in Washington, D.C.", "input_text": "Washington, D.C.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 425, "span_end": 453, "span_text": "George Washington University", "input_text": "George Washington University", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 718, "span_text": "Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa", "input_text": "Allegheny College", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 718, "span_text": "Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa", "input_text": "Meadville", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 796, "span_text": "Clinton", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 796, "span_text": "Clinton", "input_text": "Clinton", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 801, "span_text": "Clinton, N.Y", "input_text": "N.Y", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 769, "span_end": 796, "span_text": "Hamilton College in Clinton", "input_text": "Hamilton College", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 804, "span_end": 846, "span_text": "says it will phase out merit scholarships ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 816, "span_end": 847, "span_text": " phase out merit scholarships a", "input_text": "phasing out scholarships", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 817, "span_end": 844, "span_text": "phase out merit scholarship", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 816, "span_end": 845, "span_text": " phase out merit scholarships", "input_text": "merit scholarships", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 924, "span_end": 945, "span_text": "need-based aid alone ", "input_text": "need-based", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 924, "span_end": 1008, "span_text": "need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.

Isabel and the twins are doing well. Heaven knows what is to become of us! \n\n'Yours, J. F.' \n\n'What would you have?' said Lord Ormersfield, calmly.

We may not be geniuses -- me included -- but we intuitively grasp when a politician has merely slipped up or when he or she has revealed something much more significant. \n\nThe first type of political gaffes are just that: mistakes. For example, when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama said he had campaigned in \"57 states.\" Or when Rep. Michele Bachmann suggested that the American Revolution had started in New Hampshire. \n\nThese kinds of comments are generally overcome. The only time they're potentially fatal is if they occur with such frequency that they begin to define the politician. Note to Joe Biden: You are really getting close to achieving that feat. \n\nThen there are the gaffes that are not gaffes at all. These reveal the candidate's views on an issue or a character flaw that we had not previously seen. \n\nRep. Todd Akin's notorious remark Sunday clearly falls into the second category. \n\nAkin assessing candidacy with conservatives in Florida \n\nHis statement that a woman being raped could magically shut off her reproductive system and avoid becoming pregnant was so outrageous that even Mitt Romney quickly denounced him.

Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds. \n\nNow there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \"It's not easy work,\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\" \n\nTo adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded. \n\nDespite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \"I'm fed up,\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\" she said. \"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\" \n\nTo visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China.

Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application.

In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Collectively, they are known as CJKV characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. \n\nChinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. Simplified forms of certain characters are used in China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than Chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms (ky\u016bjitai), which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms. In South Korea, when Chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Teaching of Chinese characters in South Korea starts in the 7th grade and continues until the 12th grade where 1,800 total characters are taught albeit these characters are only used in certain cases (on signs, academic papers, historical writings, etc.) and are slowly declining in use.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is used to write Asian languages?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What kind?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Do they use them in Japanese?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What do they call them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What are they in standard Chinese?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In Korean?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do they use in Vietnam?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What are they referred to as in English?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many Chinese characters are there?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many should you know to be literate in Chinese?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many forms are there?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where do they use traditional characters?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What kind do they use in Malaysia?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What about in Hong Kong?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many characters would you learn in a secondary school in Japan?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is that group called?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Do they use more than that on a daily basis?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When do they start learning them in South Korea?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "When do they stop?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How many do they learn?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 422, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "characters", "input_text": "characters", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 417, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "CJKV characters", "input_text": "CJKV characters", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 260, "span_end": 300, "span_text": "Japanese, where they are known as kanji,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 299, "span_text": "kanji", "input_text": "kanji", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 99, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi", "input_text": "Hanzi", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 332, "span_end": 338, "span_text": " hanja", "input_text": "hanja", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 357, "span_end": 383, "span_text": " a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m", "input_text": "a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 472, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "Han characters", "input_text": "Han characters", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 793, "span_end": 814, "span_text": "the tens of thousands", "input_text": "the tens of thousands", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 973, "span_end": 1039, "span_text": "requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters", "input_text": "between three and four thousand characters", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1146, "span_end": 1228, "span_text": "There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations", "input_text": "There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1738, "span_end": 1752, "span_text": "In South Korea", "input_text": "In South Korea", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1230, "span_end": 1268, "span_text": "Simplified forms of certain characters", "input_text": "Simplified forms of certain characters", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1803, "span_end": 1899, "span_text": "traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves. The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical can contains of sugar (usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors. \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name.

Saturday, by sunrise he was on foot; took his cup of chocolate; inquired about the wind, and the chances of mails arriving; opened his window, said he would have a turn in the Gardens, the morning being so fine. It was now between 7 and 8. The valet then withdrew with the chocolate apparatus; but had hardly shut the door, when he heard a deep sigh, and fall of something,--\"billet of wood from the fire?\" thought he;--upon which, hurrying back, he found it was the King, who had dropt from his seat, \"as if in attempting to ring the bell.\" King said faintly, \"Call Amelia,\" and instantly died. Poor deaf Amelia (Friedrich's old love, now grown old and deaf) listened wildly for some faint sound from those lips now mute forever.

At first he went biking alone in a nearby forest. Then he began to ride the bike along with a runner friend. Gradually, Saunders set up his mind on building up his body, increasing his speed and strength. At the age of 18, he ran his first marathon. The following year he met John Ridgway and started to work as a teacher at Ridgway's school of adventure in Scotland, where he learnt about Ridgway's cold--waterexploits. Greatly interested, Saunders read all he could about North Pole explorers and adventures; he decided that this would be his future. In 2001, after becoming a skillful skier, Saunders started his first long--distance expedition towards the North Pole. It took unbelievable energy.

He had come to Loring, and now he was there he did not know what to do with himself. He had come there, in truth, not because he really thought he could do any good, but driven out of his home by sheer misery. He was a man altogether upset, and verging on to a species of insanity. He was so uneasy in his mind that he could read nothing. He was half-ashamed of being looked at by those who knew him; and had felt some relief in the society of Mr. Cockey till Mr. Cockey had become jovial with wine, simply because Mr. Cockey was so poor a creature that he felt no fear of him. But as he had come to Loring, it was necessary that he should do something. He could not come to Loring and go back again without saying a word to anybody. Fenwick would ask him questions, and the truth would come out. There came upon him this morning an idea that he would not go back home;--that he would leave Loring and go away without giving any reason to any one. He was his own master. No one would be injured by anything that he might do. He had a right to spend his income as he pleased. Everything was distasteful that reminded him of Bullhampton. But still he knew that this was no more than a madman's idea;--that it would ill become him so to act. He had duties to perform, and he must perform them, let them be ever so distasteful.

The 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou () in the Thebaid (). This attestation is quite late, however, and, according to Gerald Toomer, the translator of his \"Almagest\" into English, there is no reason to suppose he ever lived anywhere other than Alexandria. He died there around AD\u00a0168. \n\nPtolemy wrote several scientific treatises, three of which were of importance to later Byzantine, Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the \"Almagest\", although it was originally entitled the \"Mathematical Treatise\" (, \"Math\u0113matik\u0113 Syntaxis\") and then known as the \"Great Treatise\" (, \"H\u0113 Meg\u00e1l\u0113 Syntaxis\"). The second is the \"Geography\", which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day.

Hassen remained silent, and of him Reist learned nothing further. The little which he knew sufficed. \n\nBrand came over and sat by Reist's side. He was a tall, fair man, with keen eyes and weather-beaten skin--by no means unlike Erlito, save that his shoulders were not so broad, and he lacked the military carriage. \n\n\"I am interested in your country, Duke,\" he said. \"You are making history there. It seems to me that it may become European history.\" \n\n\"Theos has fallen upon evil times,\" Reist answered. \"All that we pray of Europe is that we may be left alone.

A thousand torches flared in the open space before the palace. Lanterns and flags waved from all the principal houses and public buildings. Only the great Reist mansion was silent and gloomy, and many questioning eyes were turned towards it. \n\n\"It was the Duke himself who has brought Ughtred of Tyrnaus here,\" muttered one. \"Yet his house is dark and empty, and no man has seen him.\" \n\n\"There is something strange about it,\" said another, \"and I like not the wolf Domiloff at the shoulder of a Tyrnaus.\" \n\n\"Please God, the son may not be like the father!\" \n\n\"Let us see him,\" cried another. \"Come--shout!\" \n\nSo the air shook with the roar of voices, and servants in the blue Tyrnaus livery came out upon the balcony of the brilliantly-lit palace and spread a carpet. But the man whom they longed to see lingered. \n\nDomiloff argued with him in vain. He was unaccountably obstinate. \n\n\"It is the Duke of Reist who should stand by my side when first I speak to my people,\" he declared, coolly. \"It is he who brought me from England, not you. He must be my sponsor. If he is not here I will wait.\" \n\nDomiloff was naturally furious. He had been at considerable pains to insure the absence of Reist from the capital on this occasion, and his inopportune return would amount to a disaster. On the other hand, the populace were fast working themselves up into a state of frenzy. Let this man show himself, and the success of his coup was assured. It was unpardonable hesitation. He trembled with rage. In the King's palace, in his own chamber, he had lost for the moment his hold upon this man. It was the one weak spot in his carefully thought-out scheme. It was the one contingency against which he was comparatively helpless.

room -- even when the pop singer was an adult, according to a book written by a former Jackson confidant. \n\nRabbi Shmuley Boteach, Michael Jackson's confidant, sat down with the King of Pop and taped 30 hours of interviews. \n\n\"The Michael Jackson Tapes\" includes Jackson talking about his fear of growing old, his relationship with children, his friendships with Madonna and Brooke Shields, and his remarkable shyness around people that made his surround himself with mannequins. \n\nJackson opened up to Rabbi Shmuley Boteach for 30 hours of interviews, which were taped nine years ago and intended for a book Jackson wanted written, Boteach said. \n\n\"He was trying to reclaim his life,\" Boteach said Friday in an NBC \"Today Show\" interview. \n\nJackson, who died on June 25 of what the coroner found to be a deadly combination of drugs, \"lost the will to live, I think he was just going through the motions of life toward the end,\" Boteach told NBC. \n\nCNN has not independently confirmed Jackson's quotes in the book, but Boteach was known to be a spiritual adviser to Jackson for several years beginning about 1999. \n\nKen Sunshine, spokesman for the family, including the singer's father, Joe, issued a statement on the book. \"We are not going to dignify this with a comment,\" he said. \n\nThe book was not published during Jackson's lifetime because of the pop star's child molestation trial, which ended with an acquittal in 2005, the author said. The author said Jackson's arrest ended any interest in a book about him.

The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. \n\nTim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. \n\nTim answered, \"I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess.\" \n\n\"Well, we'll be there for you, either way\" his mother said. \n\nTim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be. \n\n3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. \n\nIt was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, \"What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?\" \n\nTim thought about why he signed up.

As they did not immediately see him, he stopped and stood watching them in the shadow for a few minutes. Frank was feeling more cheerful by this time, though his hands were still very sore and, as a good many of the logs were burned on the outside, he was more or less blackened all over. He was getting used to the work, and Jake, who had arrived with the sloop in the meanwhile, relieved him and his companion of the heaviest part of it. Turning around presently at a sound, Frank saw Mr. Oliver smiling at him. \n\n\"If I were as grimy as you I think I'd go in for a swim,\" he said. \"It's hot enough, and there's a nice beach not far away. I dare say Harry will go along with you while Jake and I put up these logs.\" \n\nHarry lost no time in throwing down his handspike, and they set out together down a narrow trail through the woods, which led them out by and by upon a head above the cove in which the sloop lay moored. Standing on the edge of the crag, Frank looked down upon the clear, green water which lapped smooth as oil upon a belt of milk-white shingle and broke into little wisps of foam beneath the gray rocks at the mouth of the cove.

Palestine on Friday; a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. \n\nThe formal application -- viewed as a largely symbolic gesture because an American veto is all but assured should the request come to a vote in the Security Council -- drew applause in the assembly when the Palestinian leader raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. \n\nThe time has come for a \"Palestinian Spring\" to join the Arab Spring in reshaping the Middle East, he said. \"My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity.\" \n\nBut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, later taking his turn to address the General Assembly, said Palestinians are looking for a \"state without peace,\" ignoring security concerns important to Israel. \n\nHe said Palestinians are not armed only with their \"hopes and dreams,\" as Abbas said in his speech.

Wade successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place. \n\nWade is among a list of elderly leaders clinging to power in sub-Saharan Africa despite demands for them to step down. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe used his recent 88th birthday to lash out at critics and vowed to run for re-election. \n\nThe opposition has said it will protest if Wade wins, but analysts say a lack of cohesion among foes and a system that favors the incumbent make it harder to unseat Wade, who is nicknamed the \"hare\" for his shrewd politics.

It was a fashionable doll, in a close-fitting tweed ulster, which covered a perfect panoply of other female furniture, all in the latest mode. As the child worked, she looked now and then at the illustrations in a journal of the fashions. \"There's two or three managers in treaty with me,\" said Eliza. \"There's the _Follies and Frivolities_ down Norwood way, and the _Varieties_ in the 'Ammersmith Road. Thirty shillings a week and my dresses, that's what I ask for, and I'll get it too!

The concept of justice differs in every culture. An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work \"The Republic\". Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the \"proper\" distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing.

The beat of engines quickened and when the stern swung up their furious racing shook the ship. Kit pictured Macallister, sternly calm, at the throttle wheel. Much depended on his skill, for if he were slow when the spinning screw came down and the runaway machinery resumed its load, something must break. Kit, however, did not go to the engine-room. He stood at the door of the pilot-house, inside which Miguel S\u00e6nz gripped the slanted gratings with his bare feet. His face was wet by sweat and his brown hand was clenched on the steam-steering wheel. \n\nAlthough the muscular effort was not great, steering was hard. _Mossamedes_ rode high above water and the gale pressed upon her side; the combers lifted her, and screw and rudder could not get proper hold. Sometimes she came up to windward and rolled until the white seas swept her rail; sometimes she yawed to lee. Kit saw the bows circle and pictured the compass spinning in its bowl. \n\nSo far, Miguel steered by compass. Don Erminio had changed his course and headed obliquely for the shoals. It was not the course the gunboat's captain would expect him to steer. Revillon, no doubt, imagined the line along which _Mossamedes_ travelled inclined at a small angle out to sea, in order to clear the hammered sands, and he could steam down from his commanding position and cut her off.

I'd left my family and friends in Indiana, the beloved state where I'd lived most of my life. My new home in Florida was thousands of miles away from anything I knew. It was hot--all the time. Jobs were hard to come by, but I was up for almost any challenge. \n\nAt last, I taught in a special school where students have severe learning and behavioral difficulties. \n\nAnother teacher and I had spent weeks teaching the children appropriate behavior for public outings. Unexpectedly, only a few students, including Kyle, had not earned the privilege of going. He was determined to make his disappointment known. \n\nIn the corridor between classrooms, he began screaming, cursing, spitting, and swinging at anything within striking distance. Once his outburst died down, he did what he'd done when he was angry at all his other schools, at home, even once at a juvenile detention center. He ran. \n\nPeople watched in disbelief as Kyle dashed straight into the heavy morning traffic in front of the school. \n\nI heard someone shout, \"Call the police!\" \n\nBut I ran after him. \n\nKyle was at least a foot taller than me. And he was fast. His older brothers were track stars at the nearby high school. But I could run long distances without tiring. I would at least be able to keep him in my sight and know he was alive. \n\nAfter several blocks of running directly into oncoming traffic, Kyle slowed his pace. \n\nHe took a sharp left. Standing next to a trash bin, Kyle bent over with his hands on his knees. I must have looked ridiculous. But his was not a look of fear. I saw his body relax. He did not attempt to run again. Kyle stood still and watched me approach. I had no idea what I was going to say or do, but I kept walking closer. \n\nHe opened his mouth to speak when a police car pulled up, abruptly filling the space between Kyle and me. The school principal and an officer got out. They spoke calmly to Kyle, who willingly climbed into the back of the vehicle. I couldn't hear what was said, but I didn't take my eyes off Kyle's face, even as they drove away. \n\nI couldn't help but feel that I had failed him, that I should have done or said more, that I should have fixed the situation. \n\nI shared my feelings with a speech therapist who was familiar with Kyle's history. \"No one ever ran after him before, Rachel,\" she said. \"No one. They just let him go.\" \n\nThings changed the day he ran and I ran after him, even though I didn't have the right words, even though I wasn't able to save him from the mess he was in. It was the day I didn't throw my hands in the air and decide he was too fast, a waste of time and effort , a lost cause.

crushed division two team Real Betis 5-0 in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarterfinal on Wednesday night. \n\nThe Argentina forward, who headed off clubmates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to win the FIFA Ballon d'Or on Monday, proved the difference after the visitors provided stern early resistance. \n\nThe 23-year-old finally broke the deadlock a minute before halftime with a delightful chip, and the tie was effectively over ahead of next week's second leg when he completed his treble with 17 minutes to play. \n\nBetis deserved better for their first-half efforts, highlighted by Ruben Castro crashing a shot against the crossbar soon after Messi's opener. \n\nWhy were EPL players snubbed in all-star selection? \n\nBut in the end they had goalkeeper Casto to thank that the scoreline was not even greater as he bravely thwarted a succession of Barca attacks. \n\nAs it was, Pedro made it 4-0 on 76 with his 13th goal in 14 games after Casto blocked Daniel Alves' initial effort, and Seydou Keita headed the fifth with seven minutes to play as he rose high to meet Iniesta's outrageous scooped cross. \n\nMidfielder Iniesta also had an assist with Messi's first, while the second came

Their purpose was to photograph clothing fashions. Diane Arbus was the stylist. She would prepare the hair and faces of the fashion models who wore the clothing being photographed. Allan Arbus took the pictures. \n\nThe couple soon had jobs from important fashion magazines such as \"Vogue\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\". Their work was very successful during the 1950s. They became part of a group of artists that were helping to redefine visual culture. They were breaking with past traditions to create a new look for a new decade, the sixties. \n\nBut Diane was not satisfied with her secondary role. She wanted a more active part in making photographs. She wanted to explore her own artistic expression and freedom. To do this, she stopped working with her husband. Then she started taking photography classes at the New School in New York City. \n\nArbus' teacher, Lisette Model, influenced her in many ways. She showed Diane how to use a camera like an expert. She also taught Diane to use her art to face her doubts and fears. Miss Model once said that Diane soon started \"not listening to me but suddenly listening to herself.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where did Allan Arbus work?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did he influence Diane's career?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did the Arbuses first photograph?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was Diane Arbus born?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did her family struggle to make ends meet?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did she do when she finished high school?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did she use a lot of vibrant colors in her pictures?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What type of pictures did she take?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who did Diane take a class with?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What fashion magazines did the couple work with?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did Diane enjoy her role in the partnership?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What did she want to do instead?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who had an influence on her?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What things did she teach Diane?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What comment did she make of Diane?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 428, "span_end": 494, "span_text": "Arbus worked in the advertising department of her father's store.

A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \"People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear ,\"said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard rules. \"I always obey traffic rules.

This was the beginning of the library at Harvard University. The gift was so important that the university was named for John Harvard. Thomas Bray began the first free lending library in the late 1600s. He set up more than 30 or these libraries in the American colonies. However, the idea for this kind of free library ended when Bray died in 1730. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin and some friends started the first subscription library in the United States.

The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948.

The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces.

Twenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with Japan's debut, the first time an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909. \n\nThe games were the first to have art competitions, women's diving, women's swimming, and the first to feature both the decathlon and the new pentathlon, both won by Jim Thorpe. Electric timing was introduced in athletics, while the host country disallowed boxing. Figure skating was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the Nordic Games. United States won the most gold medals (25), while Sweden won the most medals overall (65). \n\nFollowing the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, the authorities in Sweden immediately sought to ensure that the next games would be held there. There were two Swedish members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the time, Viktor Balck and Clarence von Rosen. The pair proposed to the Swedish governing bodies of athletics and gymnastics in order to ensure that they backed any potential bid. Support was given by the national associations on 18 April 1909 for a bid to host the Olympics in Stockholm on the basis that suitable financial arrangements could be made. King Gustaf V was petitioned on 6 May 1909 following the publication of preliminary plans for the Stockholm bid that the expected cost of hosting the Games would be 415,000 kronor (\u00a323,050 or $115,250).

The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked . He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela. The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe. He hopes someone will rescue him, but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued. Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719. Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, who was a Scottish sailor. On an expedition in 1704, Selkirk had an argument with his ship's captain. Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart. When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water, Selkirk got off. He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him, but nobody would. The shop then sailed away without him. Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island, known as Aguas Buenas. Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709. The ship's captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived. Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk's camp on Aguas Buenas. They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts. The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there. The post holes are near a fresh water stream. They are located quite high up, which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island.

Malm\u00f6 is the third largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the fifth largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of above 300,000. The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 3.9\u00a0million people. \n\nMalm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns of Scandinavia, but it struggled with the adaptation to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation with architectural developments, and it has attracted new biotech and IT companies, and particularly students through Malm\u00f6 University, founded in 1998. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial centre for the western part of Scania. \n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was \"Malmhaug\" (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\". \n\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most frequented cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396\u20131439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania.

Richard, as he was desired by Sir Eric de Centeville, took off his cap, and bowed low in reply to the reverences with which they all greeted his entrance, and he then slowly crossed the hall, and descended the steps from the door, while they formed into a procession behind him, according to their ranks--the Duke of Brittany first, and then all the rest, down to the poorest knight who held his manor immediately from the Duke of Normandy. \n\nThus, they proceeded, in slow and solemn order, till they came to the church of our Lady. The clergy were there already, ranged in ranks on each side of the Choir; and the Bishops, in their mitres and rich robes, each with his pastoral staff in his hand, were standing round the Altar. As the little Duke entered, there arose from all the voices in the Chancel the full, loud, clear chant of _Te Deum Laudamus_, echoing among the dark vaults of the roof. To that sound, Richard walked up the Choir, to a large, heavy, crossed-legged, carved chair, raised on two steps, just before the steps of the Altar began, and there he stood, Bernard de Harcourt and Eric de Centeville on each side of him, and all his other vassals in due order, in the Choir.

Roger Federer is closing on his Spanish rival's No. 2 ranking and his Masters titles record after reaching the final in Madrid. \n\nNadal, like Novak Djokovic, couldn't wait to get away from the controversial blue clay at the Caja Magica but Federer has made the best of the situation and thrashed Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-3 on Saturday in a one-sided semifinal. \n\nWaiting in the final is Tomas Berdych, who beat a tetchy Juan Martin del Potro 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) earlier in the day. \n\nFederer will move above Nadal in the rankings if he wins his third Madrid title, and will also equal the Spaniard's record of 20 Masters titles. \n\n\"I didn't even know actually about the No. 2 ranking,\" Federer said. \"I'm focused on what I am doing here this week, trying to play well and get on a bit of a roll and I have played better and better as the tournament went on.\" \n\nTipsarevic had knocked out fellow Serb Djokovic a day earlier, taking advantage of his compatriot's dislike of the blue clay surface. \n\nBut in a match watched by Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, Tipsarevic was no match for Federer, who hit 25 winners to take his head-to-head record over the Serb to 5-0.

Firestone and Woods is outside the top two -- or if he is second, the defending champion is 10th or lower and Mickelson does not win. \n\nMickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37. \n\n\"Am I conscious of the pack closing in? Yes, because every tournament you guys remind me,\" Woods told reporters on Wednesday ahead of his bid for an eighth title in the event. \n\n\"You play.

Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. \n\nKenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline. The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks. Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world. This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighboring western region. The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park. Kenya has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year.", "questions":

Mary Wallace was habitually silent; but Anneke, without being loquacious, was sufficiently disposed to converse. This morning, however, she said little beyond what the civilities of the table required from the mistress of the house, and that little in as few words as possible. Once or twice I could not help remarking that her hand remained on the handle of a richly-chased tea-pot, after that hand had performed its office; and that her sweet, deep blue eye was fixed on vacancy, or on some object before her with a vacant regard, in the manner of one that thought intensely. Each time as she recovered from these little _reveries_, a slight flush appeared on her face, and she seemed anxious to conceal the involuntary abstraction. This absence of mind continued until Bulstrode, who had been talking with our host on the subject of the movements of the army, suddenly directed his discourse to me.

But critics couldn't quite agree on whether it was worth staying home (or even DVRing) to catch it. \n\nMatt Ryan stars as John Constantine, a rebellious and not very likable exorcist with an affinity for trench coats and cigarettes -- at least, that's how he appears in \"Hellblazer,\" the DC comic book upon which the show is based. To adhere to network standards, Constantine ditches his bad habit for TV, a source of contention for Hitfix.com critic Alan Sepinwall and others. \n\n\"The absence of John's most physically self-destructive habit is symbolic of a larger issue,\" he said. \"And as John will tell anyone who listens... symbols have meaning, and when you take them away, you can take away the power they represent.\" \n\n'Constantine' adds to TV's comic-book trend \n\nThat's not all that worries critics about Constantine, who introduces the real world of demons and ghouls in the premiere. Fans and critics believe Ryan's performance will make this show sink or swim, similar to Hugh Laurie on \"House\" or Benedict Cumberbatch on \"Sherlock.\" For some of them, it's not looking good. \n\n\"Ryan is a particular problem, I'm sorry to say,\" Vulture's Matt Zoller Seitz said. \"I don't know if he was miscast or poorly directed, but something about his grooming, makeup, and line delivery make him sound like (and sometimes resemble) Jim Carrey in comic high-dudgeon mode.\" \n\nOthers, however, took a more positive view of his performance.

In another one of his apartments in the same Mott Street building, prosecutors said, 250 small bags of heroin were found. \n\nIn addition, prosecutors said, detectives recovered nearly $1,300 in cash on Vineberg. \n\nManhattan Supreme Court Judge Edward McLaughlin set bail at $200,000 bond or $40,000 cash. Vineberg is due back in court Tuesday. \n\nVineberg's attorney, Edward Kratt, asked for a lower bail, saying his client has been an \"accomplished musician\" since the late 1980s and a \"functioning heroin addict\" with a 10-bag-a-day habit. The large quantity of drugs found in the apartments were for Vineberg's personal use, Kratt said. \n\nThe judge, however, appeared to doubt that assertion, saying that the amount of heroin in Vineberg's possession was \"off the charts.\" \n\nVineberg was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his cell phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said. \n\nOutside court, Kratt said his client hoped to raise bail money with the help of friends.

However, this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a restaurant for lunch each day before returning to the place we lived in. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I took lots of photos from the place we lived in, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam-powered trains are very popular. I took many photos of the train. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early. We usually have snow in January. It rained all day, then snowed in the evening .Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well. I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail , that Jenny is now working in a hotel.

It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa in terms of area. \n\nChad has several regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital N'Djamena is the largest city. \n\nChad's official languages are Arabic and French. Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. The religions of Chad are Islam (at 55%), followed by Christianity (at 40%). \n\nBeginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss D\u00e9by. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad.

For the most part, they were mulattos, paid low wages and willing to augment the latter by presents and bribes. As a rule, he had found them good-humored and indolent, and he imagined Don Ramon Larrinaga would be satisfied with a few particulars and a little money. There was, he thought, no use in trying to put him on the track of the unknown poisoner. He let Wyndham take the man to the cabin and sat under the awning on deck with Peters, for whom he opened a bottle of vermouth. \n\nPeters knew much about the country and told him some rather curious stories. He looked shriveled and desiccated, but his glance was keen and Marston imagined he was very shrewd.

It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus, and awarded city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin (1282\u20131316). In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when the city was reunited. As a strategic location, the city was battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times.

This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. \n\nThis December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication. \n\nEven 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. \n\nBorn in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before. \n\nIn 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light. \n\nAbout 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from. \n\nComputers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work. \n\n\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \"completely different, because of Einstein.\" \n\nHowever, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind.

More bushes were scattered over the fields, so the boy wandered on, from bush to bush, without paying any heed to where he was wandering. Then a butterfly fluttered by. He gave chase to it and followed it a long way. When finally he paused to look around him, Button-Bright could see no sign of Pon's house, nor had he the slightest idea in which direction it lay. \n\n\"Well, I'm lost again,\" he remarked to himself. \"But never mind; I've been lost lots of times.

That kind little woman, Netta White, has agreed to sit by her. I'm sorry that I shall be obliged to leave her at such a critical stage of her illness, but I am obliged to go abroad for some time.\" \n\n\"Goin' abroad, sir!\" exclaimed Mrs Roby in surprise, for the Captain had not yet told her that Lawrence was to be of the party, although he had mentioned about himself and Gillie White. \n\n\"Yes, I'm going with Mrs Stoutley's family for some weeks to Switzerland.\" \n\nCaptain Wopper felt that his share in the arrangements was in danger of being found out.

It can reveal laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author ofThe Social Animal, The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to resist the temptation. \n\nBrooks gained fame for several books. His latest bookThe Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science revealed about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? \n\nTo answer these questions, Brooks surveys a wide range of subjects. Because of this, you might expect the book to cover a variety of facts. But Brooks has structured his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. \n\nOn the whole, Brooks's story is acceptable if uninspired. As one would expect, his writing is mostly clear and, to be fair, some chapters stand out above the rest. I enjoyed, for instance, the chapter in which Harold discovers how to think on his own. While Harold and Erica are certainly not strong characters, the more serious problems withThe Social Animallie elsewhere.

Octoo was worn out with the wild rides he took, and Don openly rebelled when ordered to leap and show off his accomplishments; while the girls at college were both amused and worried by the ghosts who haunted the grounds at night, the unearthly melodies that disturbed their studious hours, and the hairbreadth escapes of this restless boy by flood and field and fire. Something happened at length which effectually sobered Ted and made a lasting impression on both the boys; for sudden danger and a haunting fear turned the Lion into a lamb and the Lamb into a lion, as far as courage went.

But today, education and administrations are finding that examples of academic dishonesty on the part of students have become more frequent--- and are less likely to be punished---than in the \n\npast. Cheating appears to have gained acceptance among good and poor students alike. \n\nWhy is student cheating on the rise? No one really knows. Some blame the trend on a general loosening of moral values among today's youth. Others have attributed increased cheating to the fact that today's youth are far more practical than their idealistic ancestors. Whereas in the late sixties and early seventies, students were filled with visions about changing the word, today's students feel great pressure to survive and succeed. In interviews with students at high schools and colleges around the country, both young men and women said that cheating had become easy. Some suggested they did it out of hate for teachers they didn't respect. Others looked at it as a game. Only if they were caught, some said, would they feel guilty. \"People are competitive,\" said a second-year college student named Anna, from Chicago. \"There is an potential fear. If you don't do well, your life is going to be ruined. The pressure is not only from parents and friends but from yourself. To achieve. To succeed. It's almost as though we have to surpass people to achieve our own goals. \n\nEdward Wynne, editor of a magazine blames the rise in academic dishonesty in the schools. He claims that administrators and teachers have been too hesitant to take action. Dwight Huber, chairman of the English Department at Amarillo sees the matter differently, blaming the rise in cheating on the way students evaluated. \"I would cheat if I felt I was being cheated,\" Mr. Huber said. He feels that as long as teachers give short-answer tests rather than essay questions and rate students by the number of facts they can memorize rather than by how well they can combine and process information, students will try to beat the system. \" The concept of cheating is based on the false belief that the system is legal and there is something wrong with _ who're doing it,\" he said, \"That's too easy an answer.

Police refused to release any details about the crime or its possible motive. \n\nThe body of York University student Liu Qian, 23, of Beijing, was found Friday in her apartment in Toronto a few hours after her boyfriend witnessed the attack, police said. \n\nShe was found undressed from the waist down but there were no obvious signs of sexual attack or trauma severe enough to kill her. Police say it may be weeks before the results of an autopsy are known. \n\nBrian Dickson, 29, stood before the court in a wrinkled white shirt and blue jeans as a charge of first- degree murder was read out. He did not enter a plea. His case was held over until April 26. \n\nDickson was arrested Wednesday. Police only announced his name and his age and asked the media not to publish any photos of Dickson, saying it could compromise the investigation. Toronto police spokesman Tony Vella declined to respond to the request further. \n\nLiu's father, Liu Jianhui, who arrived from China after being informed of his daughter's death, thanked authorities for their quick action. \n\n\"I sincerely thank the people concerned with my daughter's case,\" he told reporters after the arrest. \"Our daughter was studying very hard.\" \n\nPolice released no motive or details about Dickson, but one friend described the Toronto man as _ . \n\nPatricia Tomasi, a friend of Dickson's, told The Associated Press that she acted in a play at a local theater in Toronto with Dickson in 2007. \n\n\"He doesn't seem like the type but that's what they always say,\" Tomasi said. \"He's tall with boyish good looks. I don't know much about him except that he wanted to be an actor.\" \n\nDickson attended York University where he studied global politics, but did not earn a degree from there. \n\nHe later worked for the Atlantic Council of Canada (ACC), where he served as an assistant to the president Juilie Lindhout. According to his biography on a newsletter from the Atlantic Council of Canada, Dickson has also been a running instructor and has been involved with Developments in Literacy, a Pakistani aid organization that raises money for children in Pakistan. \n\nA statement from the Atlantic Council of Canada on Thursday said it was not council policy to comment on staff, but it confirmed that Dickson had been an intern with the council from September 29, 2008, until March 27, 2009. \n\nLiu was chatting with her boyfriend, Meng Xianchao, by webcam at about 1 am. Friday when a man knocked on the door, police said. \n\nMeng reported seeing a struggle break out between the two before Liu's webcam was shut off. Meng contacted other friends in Toronto who in turn called police. \n\nThe victim's father, Liu Jianhui, said his daughter studied at Beijing City University before moving to Canada, where she met Meng. \n\nLiu Qian's laptop computer, webcam and mobile phone were taken from the apartment the night of the attack, police said. Police said the online chat was on a live streaming camera and was not recorded, though investigators were trying to figure out if there was any way they could recover it. \n\nYork University, whose campus is located near one of Toronto's rougher neighborhoods, is one of Canada's largest universities with more than 53,000 undergraduate and graduate students. About 3,200 of York's students come from more than 150 foreign countries, the university's website says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what kind of man appeared in court?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "when did he appear in court?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "was he accused of murdering a mexican woman?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "was she chinese?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how old was she?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who said her boyfriend witnessed her murder?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how old is brian dickson?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "is he accused of murdering the chinese woman?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how long before the autopsy results are known?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "was dickson charged with second-degree murder?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what was Liu's father name?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where did he live?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who is Tomasi?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "did they act in a play together?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "did she say he was short?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what did dickson study in college?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "did he work for ACC?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "did ACC confirm that he worked as an intern?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "was liu online with Meng at the time of the murder?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what did the her attack take besides the computer and cellphone?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "is the university located near a safe neighborhood?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "how many students attend the university?", "turn_id": 22}, {"input_text": "how many different countries do they come from?", "turn_id": 23}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 16, "span_text": "A disheveled man", "input_text": "A disheveled man", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 35, "span_end": 43, "span_text": "Thursday", "input_text": "Thursday", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 70, "span_end": 83, "span_text": "Chinese woman", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 70, "span_end": 83, "span_text": "Chinese woman", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 286, "span_end": 288, "span_text": "23", "input_text": "23", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 401, "span_end": 407, "span_text": "police", "input_text": "police", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 634, "span_end": 636, "span_text": "29", "input_text": "29 years old", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 818, "span_end": 849, "span_text": "Dickson was arrested Wednesday.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 556, "span_end": 573, "span_text": " it may be weeks ", "input_text": "weeks", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 717, "span_end": 737, "span_text": "first- degree murder", "input_text": "No, first degree murder", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1093, "span_end": 1104, "span_text": "Liu Jianhui", "input_text": "Liu Jianhui", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1123, "span_end": 1129, "span_text": "China ", "input_text": "China", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1483, "span_end": 1503, "span_text": "a friend of Dickson'", "input_text": "Dickson's friend", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1533, "span_end": 1609, "span_text": "hat she acted in a play at a local theater in Toronto with Dickson in 2007.

\n\nThe National Center for Educational Statistics (or NCES) reported that U.S. colleges and universities received more than 9 million applications between 2013 and 2014 and admitted more than 5 million students. But the problem is not in the number of students, a new report says. The report is called \"Turning the Tide -- Making Caring Common.\" \n\nThe report argues that the process schools use to choose students causes major problems. David Hawkins is the Executive Director for Educational Content and Policy. He says that most colleges and universities require many things from students when they apply. \n\nSchools usually require an essay describing a student's interests or why they want to study at that school. The schools also ask for letters from teachers describing why a student is a good candidate. But, Hawkins says, schools are most concerned with a student's high school grades and standardized test results. \n\nThe Education Conservancy is an organization that fights to make higher education equal and available. Lloyd Thacker is the Executive Director of the Education Conservancy, saying that the college admission process has changed a lot. \n\n\"Over the past 30 years, college admissions have become more complex.\" He says that ranking systems for colleges and universities are a big part of the problem. \n\nU.S. News and World Report is a media company that creates a list of what it calls \"America's Best Colleges.\" The company bases the list on information collected from colleges and universities across the country.

It is written for kids ages 8 to 12. Now just sit and get through the introduction to the plot. \n\nIn 1914, a young horse named Joey is sold to a farmer. The farmer' s son, Albert, is thrilled. He cares for Joey. When the family begins to feel the financial impact of war, Albert' s father secretly sells Joey to an army officer named Captain Nicholls. Albert begs the captain to let him join the army. Albert is too young, but Nicholls promises to take good care of Joey for him. \n\nNicholls treats Joey well. Though Joey still remembers Albert, he grows to like his new master. He develops a friendship with another horse, Topthorn., who belongs to Nicholls' friend, Captain Stewart. The horses and men are shipped overseas for battle. They soon face their own battle in France, and Captain Nicholls is killed. \n\nA young soldier named Warren becomes Joey's new owner. Joey and Topthorn do well in battle, but the Germans capture Warren and Stewart and their horses. The horses' duty of pulling carts full of wounded German soldiers earns them praise. An old farmer and his granddaughter, Emilie, _ the horses as well. When the German army moves out of the area, Emilie and her grandfather keep the two horses. Joey and Topthorn are content to work the farm until another band of soldiers takes them. They become workhorses under bad conditions. Joey is very upset when Topthorn dies of exhaustion. \n\nAlone and frightened, Joey wanders into \"no-man's-land\" between the German and English camps. An English soldier takes him back to camp. \n\nJoey is reunited with Albert. As the war ends, Albert' s officer announces the horses will be sold in France. An old Frenchman buys Joey. The man, Emilie' s grandfather, tells Albert how Emilie lost the will to live after the horses were taken. However, he eventually sells Joey to Albert for one penny, as long as Albert promises to share Emilie' s story so her life will not be in vain.

Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor Noodle! Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick. Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play. Polly stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. Puff found a little red ladybug. Fluff found a big gray mouse. Noodle found a long brown stick.

Its toolbar collects data on browsing behavior and transmits them to the Alexa website, where they are stored and analyzed. This is the basis for the company's web traffic reporting. According to its website, Alexa provides traffic data, global rankings, and other information on 30 million websites. As of 2015, its website has been visited by over 6.5 million people monthly. As of June 2017, the number 1 Alexa Rank belongs to Google.com, its average daily time on site being 8 min 10 s and average daily pageviews being 8.01. \n\nAlexa Internet was founded in April 1996 by American web entrepreneurs Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat. The company's name was chosen in homage to the Library of Alexandria of Ptolemaic Egypt, drawing a parallel between the largest repository of knowledge in the ancient world and the potential of the Internet to become a similar store of knowledge. Alexa initially offered a toolbar that gave Internet users suggestions on where to go next, based on the traffic patterns of its user community. The company also offered context for each site visited: to whom it was registered, how many pages it had, how many other sites pointed to it, and how frequently it was updated. Alexa's operations grew to include archiving of web pages as they are crawled. This database served as the basis for the creation of the Internet Archive accessible through the Wayback Machine.

He was the fifth child and only son of Herbert and Dora Sims. Herbert was a blacksmith , and had a thriving trade making horseshoes. He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father. \n\nHowever, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write. \n\nOne day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\" he asked, \"if you can't read the addresses on them?\" \n\nBitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand . \n\n\"Excuse me, son?\" he said. \"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\" \n\nFor the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately. \n\nIn the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities. \n\nEdward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\" he said. \n\n\"Yes!\" said Edward. \"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was offered a job?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Because he did what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What occupation did he try to  get before that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did he get it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How would that impact the work?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Was he relieved he didn't get it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How about right after?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How did he feel?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did he help sell other stuff for the guy who hired him?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Like what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How many stores did they end up having?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "In only one town?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Where then?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What had his dad done for a living?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Was he good at helping his dad?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many brothers did he have?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What were his parents' names?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Did his stores end up going bankrupt?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1328, "span_end": 1470, "span_text": " Edward sold newspapers, lots of them.

An idiom is a phrase that we can't understand from the meaning of each word. The following are some of them. \n\nAs the crow flies \n\nWhen a bird flies from place to place, it takes the most direct route. But when people drive, they have to follow roads and often go farther. When people give a distance \"as the crow flies\", they mean the shortest distance between the two points, not the distance you would have to travel by following roads. \n\nAs Dan and his mum drove along the river, they could see the beach on the opposite side. Dan asked \"How far is it to the beach?\" \n\n\"It's only about a quarter of a mile as the crow flies\" his mother said. \n\nBlow hot and cold \n\nIn one of Aesop's Fables, a man blows on his fingers to warm them up and then blows on his soup to cool it down. In both cases, the man is opening his mouth, but what comes out is different. If a person says one thing and later says the opposite, we say that the person is blowing hot and cold. \n\n\"Is Felicia going to try out for the soccer team this year?\" Stacy asked. \n\n\"I don't know,\" Tricia replied.\" Last week she was saying yes, but this week she's saying no. She's really blowing hot and cold.\" \n\nBreak the ice \n\nNowadays people use the phrase to refer to ending an awkward silence by beginning a conversation. \n\nIt was the first day of summer camp. The four girls began to make their beds in silence. None of the girls knew each other, and no one knew what to say. Finally, one of them broke the ice by saying\" Hey, where's everybody from?\" \n\nBury the hatchet \n\nIn native American culture, when two nations agreed to end their war, they buried the hatchet. So to bury the hatchet is to make peace with someone else. \n\nColin could not excuse his sister for breaking his tennis racket.

He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers.

In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest.

Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, it operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters on Jones Branch Drive in McLean, Virginia. It is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally.

Early, regional prototypes included \"East Bay Today\", an Oakland, California-based publication first published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the \"Oakland Tribune\", an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time. On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication; the copies, which displayed two proposed design layouts, were mailed to various newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and input. The Gannett Company's Board of Directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, which would be titled \"USA Today\", on December 5, 1981; with the launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many copies of USA Today go out per week?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How many people read it each day?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Are any U.S. newspapers as widely read as it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Can you find the paper in Puerto Rico?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What about Alaska?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What company owns the paper?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "True or False: It is their most important publication.", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where is the paper headquartered?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "On what street?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is it only printed there?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "In how many places is it printed?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "True or False: The paper has had an influential design.", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is one component of the paper's design?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "And another?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "And one more?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who chairs the Gannett Company?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "People from what work group met him in Florida?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What was the goal of their meeting?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Where in Florida did they meet?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When was the paper launched?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 674, "span_end": 683, "span_text": "1,021,638", "input_text": "1,021,638", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 718, "span_end": 739, "span_text": "seven million readers", "input_text": "7 million readers", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 774, "span_end": 845, "span_text": "of having the widest circulation of any newspaper in the United States ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 948, "span_end": 988, "span_text": "he District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 913, "span_end": 947, "span_text": " is distributed in all 50 states, ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 137, "span_end": 157, "span_text": "the Gannett Company.", "input_text": "The Gannett Company", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 83, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "that serves as the flagship publication of its owner, ", "input_text": "True", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 295, "span_text": "McLean, Virginia", "input_text": "In McLean, Virginia", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 256, "span_end": 275, "span_text": " Jones Branch Drive", "input_text": "Jones Branch Drive", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 297, "span_end": 322, "span_text": "It is printed at 37 sites", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 314, "span_end": 392, "span_text": "37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally", "input_text": "42 places total", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 395, "span_end": 442, "span_text": "ts dynamic design influenced the style of local", "input_text": "True", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 542, "span_end": 564, "span_text": "informational graphics", "input_text": "informational graphics", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 523, "span_end": 540, "span_text": " colorized images", "input_text": "colorized images", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 586, "span_end": 610, "span_text": " popular culture stories", "input_text": "popular culture stories", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1250, "span_end": 1261, "span_text": "Al Neuharth", "input_text": "Al Neuharth", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1204, "span_end": 1214, "span_text": "Project NN", "input_text": "Project NN", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1287, "span_end": 1317, "span_text": "o develop a national newspaper", "input_text": "They wanted to develop a national newspaper", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1265, "span_end": 1276, "span_text": "Cocoa Beach", "input_text": "Cocoa Beach", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1921, "span_end": 1937, "span_text": "December 5, 1981", "input_text": "December 5, 1981", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "USA_Today.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3hsyg7lrbjy1v2ga66ejruz0dt0kku", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/William Makepeace Thackeray___The History of Pendennis.txt/CHAPTER LXXI_b53564d6a1a2ff5a269fb95672bfee30574e94908b2b4c738cb205b", "story": "CHAPTER LXXI.

Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. \n\nThe circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons. \n\nHe composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music.

Very capable to assert himself, and his just rights, in this world. He was but Twenty-seven at his accession; but the Berlin Burghers, attempting to take some liberties with him, found he was old enough. He got the name IRONTEETH. Friedrich FERRATIS DENTIBUS, from his decisive ways then and afterwards. He had his share of brabbling with intricate litigant neighbors; quarrels now and then not to be settled without strokes. His worst war was with Pommern,--just claims disputed there, and much confused bickering, sieging and harassing in consequence: of which quarrel we must speak anon. It was he who first built the conspicuous Schloss or Palace at Berlin, having got the ground for it (same ground still covered by the actual fine Edifice, which is a second edition of Friedrich's) from the repentant Burghers; and took up his chief residence there. [1442-1431 (Nicolari, i. 81).] \n\nBut his principal achievement in Brandenburg History is his recovery of the Province called the Neumark to that Electorate. In the thriftless Sigismund times, the Neumark had been pledged, had been sold; Teutsch Ritterdom, to whose dominions it lay contiguous, had purchased it with money down. The Teutsch Ritters were fallen moneyless enough since then; they offered to pledge the Neumark to Friedrich, who accepted, and advanced the sum: after a while the Teutsch Ritters, for a small farther sum, agreed to sell Neumark. [Michaelis, i. 301.] Into which Transaction, with its dates and circumstances, let us cast one glance, for our behoof afterwards. The Teutsch Ritters were an opulent domineering Body in Sigismund's early time; but they are now come well down in Friedrich II.'s! And are coming ever lower.

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

Delia came to New York from the South, dreaming about music. Joe and Delia met in a studio. Before long they were good friends and got married. They had only a small flat to live in, but they were happy. They loved each other, and they were both interested in art. Everything was fine until one day they found they had spent all their money. Delia decided to give music lessons. One afternoon she said to her husband: \"Joe, , I've found a pupil, a general's daughter. She is a sweet girl. I'm to give three lessons a week and get $5 a lesson.\" But Joe was not glad. \"But how about me?\" he said.\" Do you think I'm going to watch you work while I play with my art? No, I want to earn some money too.\" \"Joe, , you are silly,\" said Delia. \"You must keep at your studies. We can live quite happily on $15 a week.\" \"Well, perhaps I can sell some of my pictures,\" said Joe. Every day they parted in the morning and met in the evening. A week passed and Delia brought home fifteen dollars, but she looked a little tired. \"Clementina sometimes gets on my nerves. I'm afraid she doesn't practice enough. But the general is the nicest old man! I wish you could know him, Joe.\" And then Joe took eighteen dollars out of his pocket. \"I've sold one of my pictures to a man from Peoria,\" he said, \"and he has ordered another.\" \"I'm so glad,\" said Delia. \"Thirty-three dollars! We never had so much to spend before. We'll have a good supper tonight.\" Next week Joe came home and put another eighteen dollars on the table. In half an hour Delia came, her right hand in a bandage. \"What's the matter with your hand?\" said Joe. Delia laughed and said: \"Oh, a funny thing happened! Clemantina gave me a plate of soup and spilled some of it on my hand. She was very sorry for it. And so was the old general.

The iron-I mean the soup-was ready about five, Why?\" \"Delia, come and sit here,\" said Joe. He drew her to the couch and sat beside her. \"What do you do every day, Delia? Do you really give music lesson? Tell me the truth.\" She began to cry. \"I couldn't get any pupils,\" she said, \"So I got a place in a laundry ironing shirts.

newsworthy scandals and catastrophes and pumps out a series of press-ups. \n\nThere are the Gao Brothers, whose sculpture of a firing squad of Mao Zedong clones taking aim at a figure of Jesus put them on the wrong side of China's increasingly skittish and jumpy authorities. \n\nAnd in southern China's Yangjiang -- an unprepossessing industrial city famous for producing one in 10 of the knives and scissors found in American homes -- there's the Yangjiang Group; a trio of seasoned drinkers whose work, while not overtly political, attacks one of the Chinese culture's sacred traditions -- calligraphy. \n\n\"When I was at school, my teacher used to tell me how bad my handwriting was,\" says Zheng Guogu, an artist in his own right outside the group, but who has worked with the other two -- Chen Zaiyan and Sun Qinglin -- for 10 years. \"But then I thought, who is he to tell me that my calligraphy is bad?\" \n\nChina works hard to project soft power \n\nIn China, writing is considered an artform and is so important to the meaning of the words that the lyrical power of a poem, for instance, is carried through the style of the handwriting.

He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \"Aquinas\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio. \n\nHe was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomism; of which he argued that reason is found in God. His influence on Western thought is considerable, and much of modern philosophy developed or opposed his ideas, particularly in the areas of ethics, natural law, metaphysics, and political theory. Unlike many currents in the Church of the time, Thomas embraced several ideas put forward by Aristotle\u2014whom he called \"the Philosopher\"\u2014and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy with the principles of Christianity. The works for which he is best known are the \"Summa Theologiae\" and the \"Summa contra Gentiles\". His commentaries on Scripture and on Aristotle form an important part of his body of work. Furthermore, Thomas is distinguished for his eucharistic hymns, which form a part of the Church's liturgy. \n\nThe Catholic Church honors Thomas Aquinas as a saint and regards him as the model teacher for those studying for the priesthood, and indeed the highest expression of both natural reason and speculative theology. In modern times, under papal directives, the study of his works was long used as a core of the required program of study for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons, as well as for those in religious formation and for other students of the sacred disciplines (philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law).", "questions": [{"input_text": "Did the Catholic Church give some major props to Aquinas?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did it honor him as?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What type of teacher is he regarded as?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is his work still studied today?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's it used as a core program for?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What an example of a sacred discipline?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What's another?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Does Thomas think that reason is found in God?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did he have any influence at all on Western thought?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How much?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What's he a proponent of?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What's an area that modern philosophy developed in based on his ideas?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What's another?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did Thomas nickname Aristotle?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What's one of Thomas' best known works?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What's another one?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did he compose any music?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What country did Thomas hail from?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What county was his ancestral origins?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What's it known as in the present?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1258, "span_end": 1300, "span_text": "The Catholic Church honors Thomas Aquinas ", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1302, "span_end": 1310, "span_text": " a saint", "input_text": "A saint.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1330, "span_end": 1347, "span_text": "the model teacher", "input_text": "The model teacher.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1470, "span_end": 1557, "span_text": "In modern times, under papal directives, the study of his works was long used as a core", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1591, "span_end": 1641, "span_text": "for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons", "input_text": "For those seeking ordination as priests or deacons.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1737, "span_end": 1747, "span_text": "philosophy", "input_text": "Philosophy.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1749, "span_end": 1766, "span_text": "Catholic theology", "input_text": "Catholic theology.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 500, "span_end": 537, "span_text": "he argued that reason is found in God", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 539, "span_end": 587, "span_text": "His influence on Western thought is considerable", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 575, "span_end": 587, "span_text": "considerable", "input_text": "Considerable.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 447, "span_end": 463, "span_text": "natural theology", "input_text": "Natural theology.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 680, "span_end": 686, "span_text": "ethics", "input_text": "Ethics.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 687, "span_end": 699, "span_text": " natural law", "input_text": "Natural law.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 854, "span_end": 871, "span_text": "\"the Philosopher\"", "input_text": "\"The Philosopher.\"", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1002, "span_end": 1025, "span_text": "the \"Summa Theologiae\" ", "input_text": "The \"Summa Theologiae.\"", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1029, "span_end": 1055, "span_text": "the \"Summa contra Gentiles", "input_text": "The \"Summa contra Gentiles.\"", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1162, "span_end": 1211, "span_text": "Thomas is distinguished for his eucharistic hymns", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 47, "span_end": 77, "span_text": "was an Italian Dominican friar", "input_text": "Italy.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 373, "span_end": 380, "span_text": "Aquino ", "input_text": "Aquino.", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 395, "span_end": 402, "span_text": "Lazio.

But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the \"people's princess,\" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways. \n\nWATCH: Not everyone's mourning Thatcher's death \n\nIt has become an overused adjective in the media that Thatcher was \"divisive.\" Some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female PM, who won three successive general elections. But in the UK debate about Thatcher is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries, the Falklands War, tax and social policy, her close relationship with American President Ronald Reagan and combative stance against the European Union. \n\nTo many she was the woman who broke the mold, showing the way for others, and the leader who made \"Britain great again,\" according to PM David Cameron. Geri Halliwell, aka \"Ginger Spice\" from the 1990s girl band the Spice Girls, spoke for many when she tweeted this tribute: \"Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter who taught me anything is possible...x.\" Halliwell later deleted the tweet in the face of online criticism, but went on to regret the move, describing herself as \"weak\" and cowardly.

Edouard de Laboulaye, who studied history, admired the United States greatly. Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was a famous artist. De Laboulaye was thinking about 1876, when the country he respected so much would celebrate its 100th birthday. What gift would be good enough for the people of France to give? Right away, Bartholdi thought of a giant statue. \n\nBartholdi kept thinking about a statue for several years. Then, in 1871, he visited the United States and saw the perfect place for a huge statue. It was Bedloe's Island in New York. \n\nThe project -- the Statue of Liberty -- got started almost immediately, and Bartholdi went home to France to begin work. However, the statue was not finished in time for the 100th birthday. The United States Congress approved the use of Bedloe's Island on February 22, 1877. During the 100th celebration in 1876, the arm of the statue that would hold the torch was shown in Philadelphia. In 1879 the huge head was put on display in France. For the face of the statue, Bartholdi used his mother as a model. \n\nThe statue was finally completed in 1884. The work had been difficult enough, but then some really hard work began. The statue had to be taken apart and packed into boxes. It was not until May 1885 that the statue -- in pieces -- left France for its new home. \n\nThe statue arrived in June. However, the Americans fell behind on their part of the project. They hadn't raised enough money for building the base of the statue. People wondered if the country really needed or wanted such a gift. Finally, though, the money was raised and the base was completed.

All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.

Cai Kaiyuan, 21, made a different choice. As a graduation gift to himself, he decided to work as a volunteer teacher in a remote village in Tibet. \n\nCai, a senior majoring in electrical engineering at Huan Railway Professional Technology College, originally planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet. During his journey, Cai's idea for a different graduation gift to himself began to take shape. \"I did not know beforehand what the journey would mean to me. I just want to gain a unique experience and have pleasure in appreciating the view there,\" he said. \n\nIt turned out cycling on a plateau was extremely challenging. And it has kept changing his outlook on life. Cai's fingers even became frostbitten while cycling up a 5008-meter-high mountain, where temperatures often dropped to 18 below zero. At night, the ice covered the road and he fell off his bike three times. The lack of oxygen made him feel dizzy and weak. \"At the most serious moment, I felt that my life was _ ,\" said Cai. \n\nHowever, he also gained something unexpected. At Ya'an, a city in Sichuan, he met a group of tourists who are also university students. A girl called Wu Ling told him that she planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. He was impressed by the idea as she looked slender and weak. \n\nIt was not until he reached a family-run hotel in Shigatse that Cai's spirits began to rise. The hotel manager's two daughters enjoyed talking with him. The kids asked about his experiences on his trip, and showed him the beautiful local lakes. \"They told me that they always liked to talk to guests, as they wanted to improve their Mandarin,\" he said, \"Their parents and many locals can only speak Tibetan.\" \n\nCai was touched by the girls' story. Their situation is tough and the local people have little chance to learn Mandarin because the schools are short of teachers. \"I want to do something to improve the situation for kids like them,\" said Cai. His parents finally gave their agreement and his teachers also supported him.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the name of the first person mentioned?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did he want a car for a gift?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did he decide?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What female did he meet along the way?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did she have a goal?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What physical observation did he have about her?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "So he didn't think much of her then?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did he have a near-death experience?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 129, "span_end": 140, "span_text": "Cai Kaiyuan", "input_text": "Cai Kaiyuan", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 275, "span_text": "As a graduation gift to himself, he decided to work as a volunteer teacher in a remote village in Tibet.", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 214, "span_end": 246, "span_text": " to work as a volunteer teacher ", "input_text": "to work as a volunteer teacher", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 277, "span_text": " in a remote village in Tibet. \n", "input_text": "Tibet.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1270, "span_end": 1277, "span_text": "Wu Ling", "input_text": "Wu Ling", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1304, "span_end": 1324, "span_text": "to work as a teacher", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1304, "span_end": 1324, "span_text": "to work as a teacher", "input_text": "to work as a teacher", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1405, "span_end": 1434, "span_text": "she looked slender and weak.

Angelo West, the gunman shot to death by officers, was black. \n\nAfter the shooting, community leaders in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury, where the shooting occurred, were quick to call for calm. One said the officers were forced to return fire. \n\nStill, they were glad to see the video released for the sake of transparency. \n\n\"I think people understand that the decisions Mr. West made put his life in grave jeopardy,\" clergyman Mark V. Scott told CNN affiliate WCVB. \n\nWest had several prior gun convictions, police said. \n\nMoynihan is a former U.S. Army Ranger who was honored at the White House for his heroism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. The \"Top Cop\" helped save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the bombers. \n\nLast month, he became a gunshot victim when he and other officers in unmarked cars, but with blue lights flashing, stopped the car West was driving. \n\nWhen Moynihan opened the driver's-side door, the video shows, West sprang out and fired a shot with a pistol at the officer's face. As West ran away, he fired back at the other officers with his .357 Magnum handgun, police said. They returned fire and killed him. \n\nMoynihan, 34, survived with a bullet wound under one eye.

Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief. \n\nModernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and even the sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to \"Make it new!\" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and abstract art, all had precursors in the 19th century. \n\nA notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what shaped modernism?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "and?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what has it rejected?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "which poet is mentioned?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how many characteristics  does modernism have?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what are they?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what are these concerned with?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what did these lead to?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "has it rejected anything?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how is historical work used?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "is there more?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what is modernism?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "when did it flourish?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "in which society?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what was it's touchstone?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "when was this done?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "when did artists all have precursors?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 254, "span_end": 296, "span_text": "development of modern industrial societies", "input_text": "development of modern industrial societies", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 304, "span_end": 327, "span_text": " rapid growth of cities", "input_text": "rapid growth of cities", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 423, "span_end": 446, "span_text": "Enlightenment thinking,", "input_text": "Enlightenment thinking,", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 890, "span_end": 900, "span_text": "Ezra Pound", "input_text": "Ezra Pound", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1283, "span_end": 1311, "span_text": "self-consciousness and irony", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1283, "span_end": 1311, "span_text": "self-consciousness and irony", "input_text": "self-consciousness and irony", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1323, "span_end": 1354, "span_text": "literary and social traditions,", "input_text": "literary and social traditions,", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1374, "span_end": 1396, "span_text": "experiments with form,", "input_text": "experiments with form,", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1531, "span_end": 1584, "span_text": "Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1561, "span_end": 1585, "span_text": "the ideology of realism ", "input_text": "the ideology of realism", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1623, "span_end": 1679, "span_text": " by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting,", "input_text": "by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting,", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1680, "span_end": 1716, "span_text": "recapitulation, revision and parody.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1680, "span_end": 1716, "span_text": "recapitulation, revision and parody.", "input_text": "recapitulation, revision and parody.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 13, "span_end": 37, "span_text": "a philosophical movement", "input_text": "a philosophical movement", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 169, "span_end": 203, "span_text": "late 19th and early 20th centuries", "input_text": "late 19th and early 20th centuries", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 141, "span_end": 158, "span_text": " Western society ", "input_text": "Western society", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 890, "span_end": 934, "span_text": "Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to \"Make it new", "input_text": "Ezra Pound's injunction to \"Make it new\"", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 903, "span_end": 907, "span_text": "1934", "input_text": "1934", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1226, "span_end": 1238, "span_text": "19th century", "input_text": "19th century", "turn_id": 19}], "name": "Modernism.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "34fnn24dcm9txoko3yb4ydvtddjy5c", "filename": "mc160.dev.24", "story": "Every Monday morning, the little bad boy named Josh goes to school. \n\nSuddenly, little Josh slips on a banana skin ... \n\n- Ouch, says Josh, I fell on this and in addition I got a bump on the forehead! \n\n- Wonderful! said the banana peel.

Suddenly he hdd a brilliant idea. He stopped the meeting and asked everyone present what would happen if Sony removed the recording function and 'speaker and sold headphones with a tape player instead. Almost everyone thought he was crazy. Still ,Ibuka kept thinking about his idea and worked at improving it The result, of course, turned out to be the wildly successful Sony Walkman. Good ideas often start with a seemingly silly question. Bill Bowerman was making breakfast one day. As he stood there making waffles for his son, he wondered what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later ,he tried it and the result looked something Like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing shoe companies, he was laughed at In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather discouraged, Bowerman insisted and went on to form his own company, making NBKE athletic shoes. Sometime good ideas grow out of frustration .When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he had some paperwork that he needed to have delivered across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was impossible. He sat for a long while ,lost in thought Why couldn't there be a reliable overnight mail delivery service? He decided to design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project His business professor gave him only a C for his efforts. However, Smith was not through. He improved the idea in that class project and finally turned them into one of the first and most successful overnight mail service in the world -- FedEx. We know that each of these ideas led to a very successful product or service that has changed the way many of us live. The best questions are usually open-ended and are often silly, Children aren't afraid to ask such questions ,but adults frequently are.

It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into office are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high appreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families throughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a similar cordiality of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the coercion of any antecedents, suggests the hopeful possibility that we may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium, with cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer show their teeth with any but the blandest intentions. \n\nLucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she longed to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful news.

To think that the very day--the _very day_--after Tom had come back from Newcastle, that unfortunate young Jetsome, whom Mr. Wakem had placed at the Mill, had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit, and was lying at St. Ogg's in a dangerous state, so that Wakem had signified his wish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once!

Here are five things you need to know about the much-loved pontiff. \n\n1.

He kept his poor mother in a chronic fever of alarm, and all but broke the heart of his nurse, long before he could walk, by making his escape from the nursery over and over again, on his hands and knees; which latter bore constant marks of being compelled to do the duty of feet in dirty places. \n\nBaby Will never cried. To have heard him yell would have rejoiced the hearts of mother and nurse, for that would have assured them of his being near at hand and out of mischief--at least not engaged in more than ordinary mischief. But Baby Will was a natural philosopher from his birth. He displayed his wisdom by holding his peace at all times, except when very hard pressed by hunger or pain, and appeared to regard life in general in a grave, earnest, inquiring spirit. Nevertheless, we would not have it understood that Will was a slow, phlegmatic baby. By no means. His silence was deep, his gravity profound, and his earnestness intense, so that, as a rule, his existence was unobtrusive. But his energy was tremendous.

These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. \n\nWhile anti-statism is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014the state system. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics. \n\nAnarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications. \n\nThe word \"\" is composed from the word \"anarchy\" and the suffix \"-ism\", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. \"anarchy\" (from , \"anarchos\", meaning \"one without rulers\"; from the privative prefix \u1f00\u03bd- (\"an-\", i.e. \"without\") and , \"archos\", i.e. \"leader\", \"ruler\"; (cf. \"archon\" or , \"arkh\u0113\", i.e. \"authority\", \"sovereignty\", \"realm\", \"magistracy\")) and the suffix or (\"-ismos\", \"-isma\", from the verbal infinitive suffix -\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"-izein\"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as Robespierre did the H\u00e9bertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.

Foo-foo the First. \n\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge, keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently. He was disappointed in this, however. By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to how to proceed. Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day. Nightfall found him leg-weary, half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. As he lay thinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: The boy would escape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his former haunts? No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? Never having had a friend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not require him to go toward London and danger. He would strike for Hendon Hall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him.

The country hereabouts was in bad posture of defence; nothing between us and Vienna itself, in a manner. Rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needful, on that Iglau Magazine, on one's own Sechelles resources; rushing on, with the Saxons, with the French, emulous on the right hand and the left, a Captain like Friedrich might have gone far; Vienna itself--who knows!--not yet quite beyond the reach of him. Here was a way to check Khevenhuller in his Bavarian Operations, and whirl him back, double-quick, for another object nearer home!--But, alas, neither the Saxons nor the French would rush on, in the least emulous. The Saxons dragged heavily arear; the French Detachment (a poor 5,000 under Polastron, all that a captious Broglio could be persuaded to grant) would not rush at all, but paused on the very frontier of Moravia, Broglio so ordering, and there hung supine, or indeed went home. \n\nFriedrich remonstrated, argued, turned back to encourage; but it was in vain. The Saxon Bastard Princes \"lived for days in any Schloss they found comfortable;\" complaining always that there was no victual for their Troops; that the Prussians, always ahead, had eaten the country. No end to haggling; and, except on Friedrich's part, no hearty beginning to real business. \"If you wish at all to be 'King of Moravia,' what is this!\" thinks Friedrich justly.

Its origins go back to the formation of the American branch of Decca Records in September 1934. The Decca Record Co. Ltd. of England spun American Decca off in 1939. MCA Inc. merged with American Decca in 1962. The present organization was formed when its parent company Seagram purchased PolyGram in May 1998 and merged it with Universal Music Group in early 1999. However, the name had first appeared in 1996 when MCA Music Entertainment Group was renamed Universal Music Group. The PolyGram acquisition included Deutsche Grammophon which traces its ancestry to Berliner Gramophone making Deutsche Grammophon UMG's oldest unit. UMG's Canadian unit traces its ancestry to a Berliner Gramophone breakaway firm the Compo Company. \n\nBetween 1995 and 2000, music companies were found to have artificially inflated compact disc prices through the use of illegal marketing practices such as minimum advertised pricing, doing so in order to end price wars that began in the early 1990s by discounters such as Best Buy and Target. A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music and Universal Music Group. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing.

On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

Inspired by the lack of educational opportunities for their son Ben, who suffers from cerebral palsy, they co-founded the Bridge School in 1986, which educates children with severe physical impairments. They raise funds for it every year with an all-star concert in Mountain View, California.

Elsley had never forgiven himself for his passion that first morning. He had shown Campbell his weak side, and feared and disliked him accordingly. Beside, what might not Thurnall have told Campbell about him? And what use might not the Major make of his secret? Besides, Elsley's dread and suspicion increased rapidly when he discovered that Campbell was one of those men who live on terms of peculiar intimacy with many women; whether for his own good or not, still for the good of the women concerned. For only by honest purity, and moral courage superior to that of the many, is that dangerous post earned; and women will listen to the man who will tell them the truth, however sternly; and will bow, as before a guardian angel, to the strong insight of him whom they have once learned to trust. But it is a dangerous office, after all, for layman as well as for priest, that of father-confessor. The experience of centuries has shown that they must needs exist, wherever fathers neglect their daughters, husbands their wives; wherever the average of the women cannot respect the average of the men. But the experience of centuries should likewise have taught men, that the said father-confessors are no objects of envy; that their temptations to become spiritual coxcombs (the worst species of all coxcombs), if not intriguers, bullies, and worse, are so extreme, that the soul which is proof against them must be either very great, or very small indeed. Whether Campbell was altogether proof, will be seen hereafter. But one day Elsley found out that such was Campbell's influence, and did not love him the more for the discovery.
