But a time at length arrived when circumstances permitted him to turn his eyes once more with a set purpose on the unknown wilderness of the West. Seated one fine morning about the beginning of spring, in his wooden residence at Fort Chipewyan, he observed Reuben Guff passing the window with an axe on his shoulder, that worthy, with his son and Swiftarrow, having engaged in the service of the fur-traders at the end of the late expedition. Opening the door, Mackenzie called him in. \n\n\"Where are you bound for just now, Reuben?\" \n\n\"To dinner, monsieur.\" \n\n\"Reuben,\" said Mackenzie, with a peculiar look, \"has all your pioneering enthusiasm oozed out at your finger ends?\" \n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied the man, with a slight smile, \"but Lawrence and I have bin thinkin' of late that as Monsieur Mackenzie seems to have lost heart, we must undertake a v'yage o' diskivery on our own account!\" \n\n\"Good. Then you are both ready, doubtless, to begin your discoveries with a canoe journey of some extent on short notice?\" \n\n\"At once, monsieur, if it please you.\" \n\n\"Nay, Reuben, not quite so fast as that,\" said Mackenzie, with a laugh; \"you may have your dinner first.

For a man to admit to a distaste in fishing would be like denouncing mother - love or hating moonlight.\" \n\nI can't say that I'm the biggest John Steinbeck fan. Actually, the only thing I can ever remember reading by him was \"The pearl\" when I was in middle school, but I couldn't agree more with the man when it comes to fishing.

Fishing is a way of life for many people and a way to escape everyday stress. Being a fisherman makes me a member of a wonderful group of people extending to all walks of life. Even President Obama can be found fishing on his farm in Texas with his good friend Roland Martin when the job gets too stressful. \n\nI can remember fishing with my grandfather when I was 5 years old on his boat at Lake Mitchell. Although I didn't understand what I was doing, I did know that my grandfather was happy and that made me happy. Since then I've spent the past 16 years on the rivers and lakes of Alabama. \n\nAfter days of practice, before and after work, I slowly developed an understanding of fishing. My boss, Ric Horst, took me back to the Shoshone, and I managed to bring in a 19-inch cutthroat trout. Fishing with Ric was a life-changing experience for me. He not only showed me how to fish correctly, but also told me how fishing could be a way to escape your problems. \n\nSince then, prime-time season seems to take forever to arrive. \n\nNow, with the ending of February and beginning of March in sight, the excitement of heading out Lake Tuscaloosa or Lake Lurleen before classes and catching something has finally returned.", "questions": [{"input_text": "which former president is mentioned?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "how much does fishing bring?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "according to who?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "where did the author fish for long?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "who did he fish with early in life?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "where?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how old was he?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "and who with later?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "what was his name?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "can fishing help with problems?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "where does he go in March?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "and?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did Ric teach him anything?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "who does Obama fish with?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "name?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what fish does the author catch off of the keys?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "where does he catch tarpon?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what did Steinback say about Americans?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what did the author read?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1002, "span_end": 1017, "span_text": "President Obama", "input_text": "President Obama", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 594, "span_end": 711, "span_text": "According to the American Sports Fishing Association, the fishing industry brings in more than $ 116 billion per year", "input_text": "$ 116 billion per year", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 594, "span_end": 646, "span_text": "According to the American Sports Fishing Association", "input_text": "the American Sports Fishing Association", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1337, "span_end": 1412, "span_text": " Since then I've spent the past 16 years on the rivers and lakes of Alabama", "input_text": "rivers and lakes of Alabama", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1130, "span_end": 1195, "span_text": "I can remember fishing with my grandfather when I was 5 years old", "input_text": "his grandfather", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1132, "span_end": 1225, "span_text": "can remember fishing with my grandfather when I was 5 years old on his boat at Lake Mitchell.", "input_text": "Lake Mitchell.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1131, "span_end": 1195, "span_text": " can remember fishing with my grandfather when I was 5 years old", "input_text": "Five", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1511, "span_end": 1560, "span_text": "My boss, Ric Horst, took me back to the Shoshone,", "input_text": "his boss", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1520, "span_end": 1529, "span_text": "Ric Horst", "input_text": "Ric Horst", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1714, "span_end": 1784, "span_text": " but also told me how fishing could be a way to escape your problems.

Jay was _ so he asked a priest what the telephone was used for. The priest told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. Jay thanked the priest and went along his way. Next stop was in Des Moines, and there at a very large church, he saw the same looking golden telephone with the same sign under it. A nearby nun told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. Jay decided to travel to Australia to see if they had a similar phone. He arrived at Western Australia, and again, in the church he entered, there was the same looking golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read \"40 cents per call.\" Somewhat surprised, Jay asked the priest about the sign. 'Father Brian, I travelled all over the world and I saw this same golden telephone in many churches. I know it is a direct line to Heaven, but in all of them price was $10,000 per call.

This impressed Network Solutions and they invited him to attend a class on Web design and development. His mom and uncle criticised him for not taking his education seriously. But gradually, his dad started encouraging him and even bought him a computer and Net connection. In fact, that was his first investment in the company. \n\nOn May 14, 2000, along with friends Clifford Leslie and Binay M. N, he floated his own website -- www.coolhindustani.com. He did not have the money to start, for his parents refused to give him a penny. So he wrote to Network Solutions Inc. in the US and they readily agreed. \n\nIn August, the same year, he set up Globals Inc., a Web solutions and networking company, with a team of four. Now, he has 400 employees, more than 200 customers across the globe and offices in 11 countries, and he is worth over $100 million. \n\nAfter finishing his high school education, he studied at Stanford University for two years.

But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. \n\nOne of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. \n\nThey did not find much long-term \"organizational learning\" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. \n\nThe study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. \n\nIn two thousand two, a piece of insulating material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. \n\nThen, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. \n\nProfessor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. \n\nHe advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. \n\nThe mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly. \n\nFabricio Cmino wrote: Not long ago I wanted to watch TV, but it wouldn't turn on, so I did everything I could to start it.

The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. \n\nThe Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas, a Roman goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a \"tabula ansata\" inscribed in Roman numerals with \"JULY IV MDCCLXXVI\" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. \n\nBartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who designed the Statue of Liberty?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was he inspired by?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was the statue made of?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Which country was it made for?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did the U.S. order it to be built?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How did it come that they were given ownership then?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "From whom?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did France finance it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is it a figure of?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who is she in likeness of?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who is that?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is she holding anything?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How is she holding it?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "With which hand?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Is she holding anything with her left?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What is it inscribed with?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What's the significance of them?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who built the statue?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 259, "span_end": 317, "span_text": "was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi", "input_text": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 467, "span_text": "Libertas", "input_text": "Libertas", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 189, "span_text": "The copper statue,", "input_text": "copper", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 229, "span_end": 257, "span_text": " people of the United States", "input_text": "United States", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 171, "span_end": 257, "span_text": "The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 190, "span_end": 257, "span_text": "a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States", "input_text": "it was a gift", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 190, "span_end": 223, "span_text": "a gift from the people of France ", "input_text": "the people of France", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1228, "span_end": 1281, "span_text": "aboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 420, "span_end": 445, "span_text": "a figure of a robed woman", "input_text": "a robed woman", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 484, "span_text": "Libertas, a Roman goddess", "input_text": "Libertas", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 459, "span_end": 484, "span_text": "Libertas, a Roman goddess", "input_text": "a Roman goddess", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 486, "span_end": 586, "span_text": "She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a \"tabula ansata\"", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 486, "span_end": 504, "span_text": "She holds a torch ", "input_text": "a torch", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 496, "span_end": 519, "span_text": "a torch above her head ", "input_text": "above her head", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 523, "span_end": 538, "span_text": " her right hand", "input_text": "right", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 540, "span_end": 586, "span_text": "and in her left hand carries a \"tabula ansata\"", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 551, "span_end": 585, "span_text": "left hand carries a \"tabula ansata", "input_text": "a \"tabula ansata\"", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 587, "span_end": 615, "span_text": "inscribed in Roman numerals ", "input_text": "Roman numerals", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 656, "span_end": 704, "span_text": "the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "input_text": "the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 322, "span_end": 345, "span_text": "built by Gustave Eiffel", "input_text": "Gustave Eiffel", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Statue_of_Liberty.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7xum89", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Charlotte Mary Yonge___John Keble's Parishes.txt/CHAPTER IV_5890a045e8aab4f9e64d31fc80198e311dc181d6fad3a8d3c4a58b2", "story": "CHAPTER IV--PURITAN TIMES \n\n\n\nAfter his dispute with the haymakers, Sir Thomas Clarke sold Merdon to William Brock, a lawyer, from whom it passed to John Arundel, and then to Sir Nathanael Napier, whose son, Sir Gerald, parted with it again to Richard Maijor, the son of the mayor of Southampton.

The neighbourhood of the Welleses at Brambridge probably moved him to make this condition. \n\nThe person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean of Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before 1643, and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and there died, leaving his widow in possession. \n\nWhether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not know. He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented the forge in Hursley, the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield was then spelt, and thought him a severe lord to his copyholders.

In 1993, he set out to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain. But Greg never made it to the top. After five days, he stumbled into the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan, injured and hungry. The kind villagers there looked after him for several days. Greg saw that the villagers were very poor and hungry, and some of them were ill. Also, the village school didn't have a roof and the children wrote on the ground with sticks, Greg knew he wanted to do something to help. \"I'll build you a school,\" he told the villagers. \"I promise.\" Greg went back home to the USA to raise money for the school. He even lived in the car to save money! Finally he went back to Korphe and built the school. But _ was just the beginning of something bigger! Since then, Greg's organization has built around 80 schools and runs many others in Pakistan and other countries, too. Greg hasn't finished yet.

You scamp, take that!\" And letting out with his foot, he gave Sam a vigorous kick on the side. At the same time Baxter struck the boy in the head with a stick he had been carrying, and then Sam suddenly lost consciousness. \n\nIn the meantime Tom was having a similar struggle with Harney and Husty.

Background, described as family, education, and experience, proved his lowest score at 32nd. \n\nThis is the 5th time the institute has conducted the survey of U.S. presidents, which is done a year after a new president takes office. The first survey was done in 1982. \"Obviously, there's not great _ to the poll since the Presidents have only been in office for one year,\" says the survey's co-director and statistician Douglas Lonnstrom. \"But it's a benchmark for us to see how they move.\" \n\nPresidents tend to rank around 20th while they are in office, and Obama is no exception. His actions over the next few years will decide if he stays roughly the same like Reagan--who moved from 16th to 20th, 22nd, 16th again, and finally to 18th this year--or like Bush, who fell from 23rd to 39th. \n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt has held his title as top president since 1982 with the same four following as top five: Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. \n\nThe survey, which ranks Presidents using 20 different factors, shows Jefferson was the most intelligent president, Richard Nixon was the worst at honesty and avoiding serious mistakes, Lincoln had the best overall ability, and Washington was the best leader.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What place does Obama rank as best of the worst?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was in the bottom five?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "According to who?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many different factors are considered?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What year was the first survey done?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "HOw many times has it been done?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who is ranked as being the smartest?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who is top president?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What place is Bush in?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did Obama place 7th in?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And 8th?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was his lowest?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who is best in leadership?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How about worst overall in telling the truth?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When is the poll given?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is Lincoln best at?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 22, "span_end": 26, "span_text": "15th", "input_text": "15th", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 103, "span_end": 118, "span_text": "George W.

Alexandra's father Niki left Romania for political reasons in 1985. At first he tried his best to learn English and had different kinds of low-paid jobs. In 1987, he brought his wife and Alexandra, who was then 18 months old, to America. The family was very poor. Alexandra began to draw at the age of three.

That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor.

It was a common sound in the 1960s. But this was not just another countdown. It was the beginning of a historic event. It was the countdown of Apollo 11 -the space fligh that would carry men to the first landing on the moon. \n\nIn the spaceship at the top of the rocket were three American astronauts whose names would soon be known around the world: Neil Armstrong. Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins. \n\nNeil Armstrong was the commander of the spaceship. Edwin Aldrin was the pilot of the moon lander. The astronauts gave it the name the Eagle. Michael Collins was the pilot of the command module , Columbia. He would wait in orbit around the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin landed and explored the surface. \n\nOn Earth, all activity seemed to stop. President Richard Nixon gave federal government workers the day off to watch the moon landing on television. Around the world, 500 million people watched the television report. Countless millions more listened on their radios. \n\nArmstrong and Aldrin started the lander rocket engine. It slowed the spacecraft and sent it down toward the landing place. It was in an area known as the \"Sea of Tranquility \". \n\nThe moon lander, controlled by a computer, dropped toward the airless surface of the moon. 140 meters from the surface, the astronauts look control of the lander from the computer. They moved the Eagle forward, away from a very rocky area that might have caused a difficult landing. \n\nIt took the astronauts more than three hours to complete the preparations for leaving the lander. It was difficult - in the Eagle's small space - to get into space suits that would protect them on the moon's surface. \n\nFinally, Armstrong and Aldrin were ready. They opened the door. Armstrong went out first and moved slowly down the ladder. At 2:56 on July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon. \n\n\"That's one small step for man,\"he said, \"one giant leap for mankind.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which astronauts were on the spaceship?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "which spaceship?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who was piloting?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was commander?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what was so special about this flight?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who was pilot of the command module?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "did he also explore the moon's surface?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what did he do?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who did get out and walk on the moon?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who got the day off that day?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how many watched it on TV?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "who was president?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What area did the spaceship land?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "how long did they prepare to leave the craft?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "who went out first?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what was the exact time?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did he say something?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "where was the spacecraft moved from after initial landing?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what did they wear to protect them from the moon's atmosphere?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "was the moon lander being manipulated by a computer?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 377, "span_end": 425, "span_text": "Neil Armstrong.

Scientists can use the DNA collected from animal waste to identify individuals, sex, and population sizes -- all without ever seeing the animal itself. \"It can take years to gather this kind of information if you have to trap animals,\" Hurt explains. \n\nWaste analysis might make a huge difference when wild species are accused of attacking domestic livestock . Hurt says, \"A good detection dog will find the waste so we can see what the animal is actually eating.\" This may help reduce problems between people and wildlife.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Detection dogs are sometimes taught to locate what?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what do they normally locate?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what do the scientits want it for", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "is there DNA", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what can it identify?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "how long would it normally take to gather this info?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What kind of dog is Oakley?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What's his handler's name?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he find?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did she give him ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "does he want the waste?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what did Aimee co-found?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "where is she?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "doing?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "who si she training?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "and?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "how does waste analysis help investigate domestic livestock attacks?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "will that reduce problems?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 723, "span_end": 738, "span_text": " actual animals", "input_text": "actual animals", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 836, "span_end": 902, "span_text": "the waste of creatures such as bears, wolves and mountain lions. \n", "input_text": "the waste of creatures such as bears, wolves and mountain lions.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 947, "span_end": 967, "span_text": "data about a species", "input_text": "data about a species", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 969, "span_end": 1023, "span_text": "Scientists can use the DNA collected from animal waste", "input_text": "Scientists can use the DNA collected from animal waste", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1027, "span_end": 1074, "span_text": "identify individuals, sex, and population sizes", "input_text": "identify individuals, sex, and population sizes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1121, "span_end": 1203, "span_text": "\"It can take years to gather this kind of information if you have to trap animals,", "input_text": "\"It can take years to gather this kind of information if you have to trap animals,", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 4, "span_end": 19, "span_text": "German shepherd", "input_text": "German shepherd", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 457, "span_end": 467, "span_text": "Aimee Hurt", "input_text": "Aimee Hurt", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 263, "span_end": 308, "span_text": " the waste of an endangered African wild dog.", "input_text": "the waste of an endangered African wild dog.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 353, "span_end": 365, "span_text": " tennis ball", "input_text": "tennis ball", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 415, "span_end": 449, "span_text": "He doesn't actually want the waste", "input_text": "He doesn't actually want the waste", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 489, "span_end": 540, "span_text": " the U.S.-based group Working Dogs for Conservation", "input_text": "the U.S.-based group Working Dogs for Conservation", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 542, "span_end": 558, "span_text": "Hurt is in Kenya", "input_text": "Hurt is in Kenya", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1222, "span_end": 1236, "span_text": "Waste analysis", "input_text": "Waste analysis", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 141, "span_end": 147, "span_text": "Oakley", "input_text": "Oakley", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 19, "span_text": "The German shepherd", "input_text": "The German shepherd", "turn_id": 16, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1341, "span_end": 1431, "span_text": "\"A good detection dog will find the waste so we can see what the animal is actually eating", "input_text": "\"A good detection dog will find the waste so we can see what the animal is actually eating", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1434, "span_end": 1492, "span_text": "This may help reduce problems between people and wildlife.", "input_text": "This may help reduce problems between people and wildlife.", "turn_id": 18}], "name": "high11830.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3e7tuj2egcm900r9as17x8quiin9ds", "filename": "high13584.txt", "story": "Jane arrives at Thornfield, having been met at the George Inn. Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who arrives at Thornfield?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who owns the property?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who keeps house?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is she rude to Jane?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who is Jane there to teach?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is she a good student>", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is she a nice kid?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who does Jane aid after a spill from his horse?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How long had he been away?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does he stay home longer than intended?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who is Grace Poole?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what is her job?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who is that?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does she work responsibly?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what does she do?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who else comes to stay at the house?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "do any of the guests have names?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who dresses up to fool her?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "who has passed away?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 26, "span_text": "Jane arrives at Thornfield", "input_text": "Jane", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 312, "span_end": 356, "span_text": "Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house", "input_text": "Mr. Edward Rochester", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 186, "span_end": 217, "span_text": "Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper", "input_text": "Mrs. Fairfax", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 4, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 219, "span_end": 245, "span_text": "Jane's pupil, Adele Varens", "input_text": "Adele Varens", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 555, "span_end": 635, "span_text": "Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 555, "span_end": 585, "span_text": "Adele is a pleasant little gir", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 703, "span_end": 816, "span_text": " Mr. Rochester.

It was only when one looked closer that one realized his terrible weakness, realized how slender, indeed, the thread was by which he held on to life. There was scarcely a breath of wind stirring. The sun was high in the heavens, and the whole country seemed lulled into a state of almost unnatural repose. The distant trees were motionless, as though, indeed, they were simply painted things against that background of deep blue sky.

Following several unsuccessful attempts by Europeans to colonise the island due to resistance from the Island Caribs, French settlement and colonisation began in 1650 and continued for the next century.

Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur. He rolled and rolled until he hit into Bluebird's tree heavily. No matter how much he tried, foolish Coyote could not shake the dust from his fur. And so the fur of all coyotes had the dull colour of dust to this very day.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What color were Bluebirds feathers?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Did she like them?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What color did she like?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How blue was it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where had she seen this color?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did she fly there?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "From where?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did she bathe in the water?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Twice?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Three times?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "When did she sing?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "At night?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "For how many days?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What happened on the 3rd day?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was anyone watching Bluebird?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Was he hungry?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Where did he stay?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 10, "span_end": 53, "span_text": "Bluebird's feathers were the colour of dust", "input_text": "the colour of dust", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 54, "span_text": "Long ago, Bluebird's feathers were the colour of dust.", "input_text": "Long ago", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 55, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "She did not like her ugly colour", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 189, "span_text": "She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home.

Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite, malachite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments. Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina). Decorative art prominently features copper, both by itself and in the form of pigments. \n\nCopper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]", "questions": [{"input_text": "Does copper occur naturally?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How long has it been used?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "When was it discovered?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was found in North Iraq?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is it dated?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What metals were used by people before copper?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How many sequences did copper metallurgy have?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What happened in 2800 BC?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where was copper mined in the roman era?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What color does copper turn in architecture?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 18, "span_end": 46, "span_text": "copper was principally mined", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 749, "span_end": 806, "span_text": "It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old", "input_text": "10,000 years", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 850, "span_end": 858, "span_text": " 9000 BC", "input_text": "9000 BC", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 812, "span_end": 877, "span_text": "estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East", "input_text": "Middle East", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 879, "span_end": 922, "span_text": "a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq", "input_text": "A copper pendant", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 879, "span_end": 944, "span_text": "a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC", "input_text": "8700 BC", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 945, "span_end": 1066, "span_text": " There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper.", "input_text": "Gold and meteoric iron", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1066, "span_end": 1240, "span_text": " The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method.", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1545, "span_end": 1609, "span_text": "It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC", "input_text": "Copper was discovered sometimes before then", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 56, "span_text": "In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus", "input_text": "Cyprus", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 468, "span_end": 555, "span_text": " Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina)", "input_text": "Green verdigris or patina", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "CopperCopper_78b23ea1a80c7081667d8310a7dd50f444b422ec80077d1369471d15"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3te3o857308s1qpf7khcsazkrka2rj", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Stratemeyer___At the Fall of Port Arthur.txt/CHAPTER XX_27d9a8b3b9e409c7e5321ed6c227dae0a0c50bea5f7a6cd4e38c088", "story": "CHAPTER XX \n\nLARRY BEFORE ADMIRAL TOGO \n\nAs soon as the _Columbia_ could make the proper landing, Captain Ponsberry went ashore and reported his arrival to the authorities, and also reported the escape of Shamhaven and Peterson.

If he could see Coote that evening he might, he thought, be able to arrange some sort of connivance about the Anagrams, and his mind was chiefly busy sketching proposals for such an arrangement. It would not, of course, be ungentlemanly cheating, but only a little mystification. Coote very probably might drop him a hint of the solution of one or two of the things, not enough to win a prize, but enough to cover his shame.

He plainly saw the wish of Charles was to call into his camp such Frenchmen as, from their small number and high quality, might be considered rather as hostages than as auxiliaries; but, observant of Crevecoeur's advice, he assented as readily to whatever the Duke proposed, as if it had arisen from the free impulse of his own mind. \n\nThe King failed not, however, to indemnify himself for his complaisance by the indulgence of his vindictive temper against Balue, whose counsels had led him to repose such exuberant trust in the Duke of Burgundy.

Clara had persuaded her sisters to accompany her and Francis in an excursion as far as the village. \n\nJane yet continued reserved and distant to most of her friends; while Emily's conduct would have escaped unnoticed, did not her blanched cheek and wandering looks at times speak a language not to be misunderstood. With all her relatives she maintained the affectionate intercourse she had always supported; though not even to her aunt did the name of Denbigh pass her lips.

Grahame had a few days to spare, for he could not land his cargo before the time Don Martin had fixed; but as the arms were on board he would have preferred to wait at sea, outside the regular steamers' track. \n\nIt happened that there was no repair-shop in the town, but while Macallister thought over the difficulty a tramp steamer dropped anchor, and he went off to her, remarking that he might find a friend on board. In an hour or two the gig came back, and Grahame, hearing _My boat rocks at the pier o' Leith_ sung discordantly, saw that Macallister's expectations had been fulfilled. This did not surprise him, for the Scots engineer is ubiquitous and to have \"wrought\" at Clydebank or Fairfield is a passport to his affection. \n\nMacallister's face was flushed and his air jaunty, but the tall, gaunt man who accompanied him looked woodenly solemn. He began by emptying a basket of greasy tools on the _Enchantress's_ white deck with the disregard for the navigating officers' feelings which the engine-room mechanic often displays. After this, he went down a rope and sat on the sand under the boat's counter, studying the loose screw while he smoked several pipes of rank tobacco, but without making any remark.

Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, first published in 1813, tells the story of five young women, all of whom are looking for a husband. In order to fully understand the novel, the readers must know that at the time when Jane Austen was writing, if a family was not rich, the daughters needed to marry well in order to live a comfortable, independent life. That is the reason why Mrs Bennet, the mother of the five girls, is so eager to have her daughters married. \n\nThe heroine of the story is Elizabeth Bennet, and as in all good romantic novels, she and Darcy, the man she finally marries, remain separate until the very end of the story. The wealthy Darcy is a proud, unsociable man, and when Elizabeth hears that he has insulted both her and her family, she dislikes him very much. Poor Darcy then falls head over heels in love with Elizabeth, and has to work terribly hard to persuade her to change her mind about him. He succeeds of course, and they live happily ever after. \n\nSet at the turn of the 19th century, the novel is still attractive to modern readers. It has become one of the most popular novels and receives great attention from literary scholars .Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramas and a lot of novels and stories modeling after Austen's memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide. \n\nJane Austen is rightly famous for her style. Her sentences have a wonderful rhythm , and she makes such clever, true comments about people.

But as everything he needed was given to him without asking, Jonny became a _ . He was so spoiled by everyone that he couldn't stand any hardship. \n\nOne day Johnny heard a mother saying to her son \"Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. You are behaving like Johnny Jones.\" That made Johnny feel very ashamed. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a fool. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid that maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at Johnny, told him that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy off all. \"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying.\" Johnny asked, \"Just that? \" \"Yes, just that,\" said his father, \"It's very simple, but I warn you that it won't be easy.\" \n\nJohnny was happy like a bird, ready to follow the advice. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him candies. \"One candy less\", thought Johnny, so he only took one. That afternoon he had another chance to put it into practice by studying one minute more. The result was that he missed the first minute of his favorite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he ran up against the corner of the kitchen table.

My love to my mother--and I would be back at the house in half an hour. \n\nWe entered the cottage. \n\nDame Dermody was sitting in the light of the window, as usual, with one of the mystic books of Emanuel Swedenborg open on her lap. She solemnly lifted her hand on our appearance, signing to us to occupy our customary corner without speaking to her. It was an act of domestic high treason to interrupt the Sibyl at her books. We crept quietly into our places. Mary waited until she saw her grandmother's gray head bend down, and her grandmother's bushy eyebrows contract attentively, over her reading. Then, and then only, the discreet child rose on tiptoe, disappeared noiselessly in the direction of her bedchamber, and came back to me carrying something carefully wrapped up in her best cambric handkerchief.

Whether indulging his passionate fondness for the jumping-jack, or engaged in guiding the deliberations of his counsellors, the earnest chief was equally devoted to the work in hand. Being a savage--and, consequently, led entirely by feeling, which is perhaps the chief characteristic of savage, as distinguished from civilised, man,--he hated his enemies with exceeding bitterness, and loved his friends with all his heart. \n\nYambo was very tender to Harold during his illness, and the latter felt corresponding gratitude, so that there sprang up between the two a closer friendship than one could have supposed to be possible, considering that they were so different from each other, mentally, physically, and socially, and that their only mode of exchanging ideas was through the medium of a very incompetent interpreter. \n\nAmong other things Harold discovered that his friend the chief was extremely fond of anecdotes and stories. He, therefore, while in a convalescent state and unable for much physical exercise, amused himself, and spent much of his time, in narrating to him the adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Yambo's appetite for mental food increased, and when Crusoe's tale was finished he eagerly demanded more. Some of his warriors also came to hear, and at last the hut was unable to contain the audiences that wished to enter. Harold, therefore, removed to an open space under a banyan-tree, and there daily, for several hours, related all the tales and narratives with which he was acquainted, to the hundreds of open-eyed and open-mouthed negroes who squatted around him.

In 1492, Christopher Columbus became the first European to arrive at the islands, where he is believed by historians to have first stepped foot in the Bahamas. After the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, Europeans began to use the term \"West Indies\" to distinguish the region from the East Indies of South Asia and Southeast Asia. \n\nIn the late sixteenth century, French, English and Dutch merchants and privateers began their operations in the Caribbean Sea, attacking Spanish and Portuguese shipping and coastal areas. They often took refuge and refitted their ships in the areas the Spanish could not conquer, including the islands of the Lesser Antilles, the northern coast of South America including the mouth of the Orinoco, and the Atlantic Coast of Central America. In the Lesser Antilles they managed to establish a foothold following the colonization of St Kitts in 1624 and Barbados in 1626, and when the Sugar Revolution took off in the mid-seventeenth century, they brought in thousands of Africans to work the fields and mills as slave laborers. These Africans wrought a demographic revolution, replacing or joining with either the indigenous Caribs or the European settlers who were there as indentured servants.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What region is this about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Which body of water is it in?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many island chains are part of it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What are they?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is Bermuda included in it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is it physically located in the region?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Then why is it included?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who else lives in this region?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who lived there first?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who was the first European there?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Which place did he visit first?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Why is the region called the West Indies?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 15, "span_text": "The West Indies", "input_text": "The West Indies", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 52, "span_end": 74, "span_text": "e North Atlantic Ocean", "input_text": "North Atlantic Ocean", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 153, "span_end": 158, "span_text": "three", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 179, "span_end": 252, "span_text": " the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. \n", "input_text": "the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 464, "span_end": 506, "span_text": "Bermuda is also included within the region", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 507, "span_end": 553, "span_text": "even though it is in the west-central Atlantic", "input_text": "Not really", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 554, "span_end": 636, "span_text": " due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region", "input_text": "due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 683, "span_end": 723, "span_text": "a significant group of African descent.

One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany.

His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics.

Bringing with him two creatures appropriately named Thing One and Thing Two, the Cat performs all sorts of tricks to amuse the children, with mixed results. The Cat's tricks are vainly opposed by the family pet, who is a conscious goldfish. The children (Sally and her older brother) finally prove good ones, capturing the Things and bringing the Cat under control. He cleans up the house on his way out, disappearing seconds before the mother comes back. \n\nThe Famous Fire---Enid Blyton \n\nThe Famous Fire is Enid Blyton's most popular and celebrated series of children's books. The sequence began life in 1942, when the first book, Fire on a Treasure Island was published and it has won great praise from both fans and critics. The series has gone on to become amongst the best-loved stories ever to have been written for children. \n\nTom and Pippo in the Garden---Helen Oxenbury \n\nIn 1988 Helen Oxenbury created a series of books featuring Tom, a naughty young boy, and his beloved stuffed monkey, Pippo.

Maybe we'll do better in the future,\" he added. \n\nThe result means Saudi Arabia become the first team to bow out of the competition and puts Jordan level on points with Japan at the top of the group. \n\nMeanwhile, Group B favorites Japan claimed a hard fought 2-1 win over Syria in the day's other match to move onto four points after their two matches.

I have been away from it for over twenty years, but I still go back in my dreams.\" For Yep, whose father came from China, home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco. It was there that he learned about patience, hard work, and getting along with neighbors. \n\nMr. Brown, Laurence Yep's high school English teacher, often set high goals for his students. He was the first person to encourage Yep to write. The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep's life. At the age of 18 Yep published his first short story, a sci-fi fantasy. He has since written many books and many kinds of books. He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater. In nearly all these varied works, Yep, who is married to the children's book author Joanne Ryder, has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood: What does it mean to be Chinese and American? Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere? \n\nWhen asked, \"How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you?\" Laurence Yep replied, \"As a child I wanted to be as American as possible. Then, in my early twenties, I became very interested in my Chinese roots. For years after that, I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures.

But he vowed that the government would not interfere with the lives of traditional residents in Kanas. \n\nIt is expected that Kanas will receive more than 500,000 tourists this year, 4,000 more than last year, according to the official. \"However, there are still few overseas visitors,\" he said. Statistics showed that only 2 percent of the total number of tourists is foreigners. \"This is partly because the transportation facilities connecting Kanas are still not convenient enough,\" Mao said. At present, there is only one highway connecting Kanas. \n\n\"Upon request from tourists, construction of an airport will start this month and will be completed by the end of next year,\" the official said. A railway line connecting Kuitun and Altay will also open to traffic in 2008 to make it possible to travel to Kanas by train, probably bringing in more tourists.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How much did the government invest in the environmental facilities?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How much is that in US dollars?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What information will the new education center provide?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What role does Jim Liquan play?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "With what agency?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who is Mao Ken?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is Kanas known for?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Ken promise?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Is it estimated that Kanas will have more tourists this year?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many more?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are there many tourists from other countries?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why does Ken say that is?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "How many highways lead to Kanas?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When will the railway line open?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What will begin being built this month?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "The railway will connect which two places?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 704, "span_end": 790, "span_text": " the government invested 1 billion yuan (US $ 120 million) on environmental facilities", "input_text": "1 billion yuan", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 729, "span_end": 760, "span_text": "1 billion yuan (US $ 120 millio", "input_text": "$120 million", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 843, "span_end": 947, "span_text": ".

For several months, he lived on life support as we were forced to stand by and watch him wither away. ks5u \n\nWhile his friends were out playing baseball, and sleeping in their own beds, my son was in a hospital bed, attached to a machine that kept his heart beating. As a mother, my first reaction after crying was anger, and then I played the bargaining game: \"Take my life for his, Lord. I've lived my life but he still has so much to do.\" People all around me were praying for a heart to become available, but it made me so angry and confused because I knew for that to happen, someone else's child would have to die. How could anyone pray for that? \n\nI still remember so clearly the morning we got the call that there was a heart. As we stood in Dustin's hospital room watching them prepare him for surgery, we experienced the true definition of bittersweet. His dad and I realized that at the precise moment we were standing there with so much hope and so much love, another family somewhere was saying goodbye. We knelt down together and cried, and we prayed for them and we thanked them for giving such a selfless gift. To our amazement, just 10 days later, Dustin got to come home for the first time in many months. He had received a second chance at life. Over the next two years, he got to go to high school, learn to drive and put his brand new heart to good use volunteering at the homeless shelter and helping the elderly. \n\nDustin's new heart failed him when he was 16. A tragedy, yes, but we have to see it as the miracle it was. We received two precious years with him that we would never have had without organ donation. We have more pictures, more memories and a great satisfaction in knowing that he was able to experience some of the most exciting times and milestones in a teenager's life. When he died, difficult as it was for us, we knew that it would be Dustin's wish to give back. His eyes went to someone who wanted to see. Someone who, perhaps, had never seen the faces of the family he loved so dearly. I believe that one day I will look into the face of someone else's son or daughter, and I will see those sky blue eyes looking back at me -- the evidence of selfless giving.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who was on life support?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "how old is Dustin?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who was forced?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "forced to do what?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what was brand new?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who would have to die?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "who was praying?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "praying for what?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "did a heart become available?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "for who was the heart available to?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "when did he get the heart?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "did Dustin have heart surgery?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was the surgery a success?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "how did the surgery succeed?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "when did Dustin come home?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what occurred 10 days later?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what did he do when he came home?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "did he do anything else?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "what else did he do?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 36, "span_end": 128, "span_text": " Dustin, became very ill with a heart enlarged.

And on New York City's jammed streets, people are cycling on hundreds of miles of new bike lanes. But New York's widespread efforts to make streets safer for bikes have also left some locals complaining about the loss of parking spots and lanes for cars. \n\nWhen the weather is good, Aaron Naparstek likes to pedal his two young kids to school on a special Dutch-made bicycle. Naparstek supports the new lane. \n\nAaron: The bike lane on Prospect Park West is really introducing a lot of new people to the idea that it's possible to use a bike in New York City for transportation or to travel around. This is what 21stcentury New York City looks like. \n\nProspect Park West is still a one-way road, but where it used to have three lanes of car traffic, now it has two, plus a protected bike lane. Supporters say that makes the road safer for everyone, including pedestrians, by slowing down cars and taking bikes off the sidewalk. But some longtime residents disagree. Lois Carswell is president of a group called Seniors for Safety. She says the two-way bike lane is dangerous to older residents who are used to one-way traffic. \n\nLois: We wanted a lane -- the right kind of lane that would keep everybody safe, that would keep the bikers safe. But we want it to be done the right way. And it has not been done the right way. \n\nCraig Palmer builds bars and restaurants in Manhattan. I was interviewing him for a different story when he brought up the bike lanes all on his own. \n\nCraig: I think the biggest problem is that Bloomberg put all these bike lanes in. You took what used to be a full street and you're shrinking it. \n\nThen there are the Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, who forced the city to remove a bike lane through their neighborhood. But polls show that the majority of New Yorkers support bike lanes by a margin of 56% to 39%. Bicycle advocate Caroline Samponaro of Transportation Alternatives calls that _ \n\nCaroline: If this was an election, we would have already had our victory.

The boys laughed and shouted happily. The ball was stopped by a boy wearing a nice pair of sports shoes. John was upset when he saw it was Steven. The next morning, John's mother gave him a bill. \"Your uncle sent you a birthday present.\" She smiled. John's eyes grew big when he saw the $100 bill. Later that day, his mother bought a pair of new sports shoes and a real football. That afternoon Steven invited John to play football. Steven did not want Jack to join them only because Jack's sports shoes were dirty. When the game was over, John and Steven walked past the old bench where Jack was sitting. Steven picked up a stone and threw it at him. John, holding his new football in his hands, walked on and did not look back.

Some of them were very famous, like Coco Less and Jacky Cheung. Jay released his first album in 2000 and soon he got quite popular. Now Jay is one of the most famous singers in Asia.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement had said Friday that it had been in contact with her family in Georgia. \n\nShe joins 10 others who have reported to jails throughout Florida after being charged with felony hazing in the death of 26-year-old Robert Champion. \n\nState law provides a prison term of up to six years for a conviction on this charge, Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Lawson Lamar said last week. \n\nThe FAMU Marching 100 drum major died after collapsing on a band bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, Florida.

The boy designs all the bow ties together with seven other workers in the company, including his mother and grandmother. \"Mo is the CEO of the company, but I am the CEO of Mo,\" Bridges' grandma said. About four years ago, when Bridges went shopping for bow ties, he found they were in ugly\" black and red. He wanted a change. So he asked his grandma to teach him to sew and finally he developed the talent of creating bow ties. Though his very first bow tie didn't look nice, the young sewer kept on practicing. He used colorful cloth with different pictures. Then his parents and friends started to like his works. At first he tried to sell them online to several stores in the south. Soon Mo's bow ties became popular. With the help of Dayond John, CEO of the famous US clothes brand FUBU, Bridges built his own company. Not only did Daymond John provide money for him, but also produced Bridges to the circle of fashion and business industries. Now the 13-year-old's business has developed rapidly.

It is said to occupy continuous territory that are otherwise conventionally Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \"strategic awakening\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope and the Visegr\u00e1d Four. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. \n\nElements of unity for Western and Central Europe were Roman Catholicism and Latin. Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), The area developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet. According to Hungarian historian Jen\u0151 Sz\u0171cs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics.

But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. They were yelling and banging things together. The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet. \n\nFinally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack.

One of them, Hu Shenyuan, offered to teach his painting and poetry. During this period he earned his living by painting portraits and selling his works. Gradually he developed a reputation as an artist as well as a carpenter. In those years he devoted himself to poetry, calligraphy , and seal-carving. Although he admitted he was a versatile artist, his own criteria of his successes placed poetry first, seal-carving second, calligraphy third, and painting last. \n\nFrom 1902 to 1916, Qi toured the country five times, and he left his footmarks in many cities, such as Beijing and Hongkong. The trips broadened his vision and changed his style. In 1917 he settled down in Beijing, where he met many artists and scholars, and made friends with Chen Shizeng. Chen advised him not to _ early masters and to form his own style. \n\nThrough long years of practice, Qi Baishi evolved a distinctive personal style. The subjects of his painting were wide and various, and the flowers, birds, fish, prawns , and insects he painted are most admired by his public. To improve his technique of painting prawns, he raised some at home and frequently observed their movements. He wrote in his diary about how he had changed his method of painting prawns: \"At first my prawns owned a reasonable similarity, then they became even more realistic, and finally light and dark color1s became properly contrasted. These are the three changes.\" Qi Baishi was able to portray the same object in either the xieyior thegongbistyle.

It can uncover laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author of The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to go against the temptation. \n\nBrooks gained fame for several books. His latest book The Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science uncovered about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? \n\nTo answer these questions, Brooks studies a wide range of disciplines . Considering this, you might expect the book to be a simple description of facts. But Brooks has formed his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. \n\nOn the whole, Brooks' story is acceptable if uninspired. As one would expect, his writing is mostly clear and, to be fair, some chapters stand out above the rest. I enjoyed, for instance, the chapter in which Harold discovers how to think on his own. While Harold and Erica are certainly not strong or memorable characters, the more serious problems with The Social Animal lie elsewhere.

FORTEMANI DRINKS WATER \n\nThe thing had begun with the lowering glances that Francesco had observed, and had grown to gibes and insults after he had disappeared. But Lanciotto had preserved an unruffled front, being a man schooled in the Count of Aquila's service to silence and a wondrous patience. This insensibility those hinds translated into cowardice, and emboldened by it--like the mongrels that they were--their offensiveness grew more direct and gradually more threatening. Lanciotto's patience was slowly oozing away, and indeed, it was no longer anything but the fear of provoking his master's anger that restrained him. At length one burly ruffian, who had bidden him remove his head-piece in the company of gentlemen, and whose request had been by Lanciotto as disregarded as the rest, advanced menacingly towards him and caught him by the leg, as Ercole had caught his master. Exasperated at that, Lanciotto had swung his leg free, and caught the rash fellow a vicious kick in the face that had felled him, stunned and bleeding. \n\nThe roar from the man's companions told Lanciotto what to expect. In an instant they were upon him, clamouring for his blood. He sought to draw his master's sword, which together with the Count's other armour was slung across his saddle-bow; but before he could extricate it, he was seized by a dozen hands, and cropped, fighting, from the saddle. On the ground they overpowered him, and a mailed hand was set upon his mouth, crushing back into his throat the cry for help he would have raised.

These changes will take place in SAT college exam. The changes include the use of some words more commonly used in school and on the job instead of the words such as \"prevaricator\" and \"sagacious\". \n\nCollege Board officials said the change is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay. For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers. \n\nThey also said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently can ask for help: practicing with flashcards. They know flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping. \n\nThe essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument and it will also be up to colleges whether the essay will be required. Each exam will include a passage drawn from \"founding documents\": such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired. Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, thought to be most needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion . \n\nJim Rawlins, the director of admissions at the University of Oregon, said the changes will potentially help the students but it will take a few years to know its influence, after the students go on to college. He said some colleges are still dealing with questions about the changes made in 2005, such as how to consider the essay portion. The criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier families do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes. \n\nThe SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other main standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. The ACT took over the SAT in total use in 2012, partly because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of those states' testing scheme . \n\nACT president Jon Erickson said when hearing of the SAT changes, his reaction was that they could've been talking about the ACT now. \"I didn't hear anything new and different, so I was a little left wanting, at least at the end of this first announcement,\" Erickson said . \n\nBob Schaeffer, education director at the National Center for Fair & Open Testing, or FairTest, said it is laudable that the SAT will provide free test preparation, but it is unlikely to make a dent in the market for such preparation. He also said the new test is unlikely to be better than the current one. His organization has a database with institutions that don't require ACT or SAT scores to make admissions decisions.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are they trying to improve?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is it an important one?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "About how many people take it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "WHat is one of the updates to it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "When was that last used?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Does everyone have to take it on paper?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is this a new development?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "WHat is one of the ways to prepare for it?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "WIll this have long term benefits?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Is there a written portion?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is it mandatory?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who decides whether it is necessary?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What other topics are covered?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Will this section be getting harder?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Is this test the only option?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What is the other(s)?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Where is it preferred?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "WHat is a criticsm against the SAT?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 573, "span_end": 577, "span_text": "SAT ", "input_text": "SAT", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 91, "span_end": 103, "span_text": "college exam", "input_text": "college exam", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 2291, "span_end": 2343, "span_text": "The SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 2322, "span_end": 2342, "span_text": "1.7 million students", "input_text": "1.7 million students", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 663, "span_end": 723, "span_text": "Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004", "input_text": "Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 719, "span_end": 723, "span_text": "2004", "input_text": "2004", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 814, "span_end": 852, "span_text": "option of taking the test on computers", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 771, "span_end": 790, "span_text": "For the first time,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 988, "span_end": 998, "span_text": "flashcards", "input_text": "flashcards", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1025, "span_end": 1080, "span_text": "not the best way to build real word knowledge that last", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1189, "span_end": 1194, "span_text": "essay", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 755, "span_end": 769, "span_text": "optional essay", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1247, "span_end": 1255, "span_text": "students", "input_text": "students", "turn_id": 13, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1613, "span_end": 1638, "span_text": "a few areas, like algebra", "input_text": "a few areas, like algebra", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 2494, "span_end": 2497, "span_text": "ACT", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2494, "span_end": 2498, "span_text": "ACT ", "input_text": "ACT", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 2477, "span_end": 2489, "span_text": "central U.S.", "input_text": "central U.S.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 2553, "span_end": 2643, "span_text": "it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of those states' testing scheme .

It was based on the music called rhythm and blues that was performed by African American musicians. \n\nEarly rock and roll singers developed their own kinds of music. Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan were the most popular rock and roll musicians in the early 1960's. All were American. Then, in 1964, a new rock and roll group from England invaded America: the Beatles. \n\nSome people say the Beatles' music shook America like an earthquake. The Beatles changed rock and roll forever. Their early songs were influenced by American rock and roll musicians, including Chuck Berry. But the Beatles looked different and sounded different from any musical group before them. \n\nThe Beatles released their first album in the United States in 1964, when all of the top five records in America were by the Beatles. In 1967, they released an album called \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" It was one of the first \"concept\" albums. That is, all the songs were linked by a common story or idea. \n\nThe popularity of the Beatles led the way for more rock and roll bands from England to become popular in America. The Rolling Stones was the most important of these bands. The Rolling Stones is one of the few groups from the 1960's that is still performing and recording today. In 1965, the group recorded one of its most famous songs, \"Satisfaction\". \n\nThe musical instrument most linked to rock and roll is the guitar. Experts say Jimi Hendrix was one of the most influential guitar players in rock and roll during the late 1960's. His \"Purple Haze\" was liked by many people. \n\nBy the 1970's, rock and roll music became known as rock music. It expanded into many new forms. For example, there was country rock, hard rock, acid rock, and heavy metal rock. Punk rock, jazz rock, and glitter rock. \n\nIn the middle 1970's, experts say rock music regained some of the energy of early rock and roll.

Couldn't you get drunk on that air? I smell flowers. And oh! I'm hungry!\" \n\n\"Bo, our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your appetite holds,\" said Helen, as she tried to keep her hair out of her eyes while she laced her boots. \n\n\"Look! there's a big dog--a hound.\" \n\nHelen looked as Bo directed, and saw a hound of unusually large proportions, black and tan in color, with long, drooping ears. Curiously he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at them. His head was noble, his eyes shone dark and sad. He seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly. \n\n\"Hello, doggie! Come right in--we won't hurt you,\" called Bo, but without enthusiasm. \n\nThis made Helen laugh. \"Bo, you're simply delicious,\" she said. \"You're afraid of that dog.\" \n\n\"Sure. Wonder if he's Dale's. Of course he must be.\" \n\nPresently the hound trotted away out of sight. When the girls presented themselves at the camp-fire they espied their curious canine visitor lying down. His ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground. \n\n\"I sent Pedro over to wake you girls up,\" said Dale, after greeting them. \"Did he scare you?\" \n\n\"Pedro. So that's his name. No, he didn't exactly scare me. He did Nell, though. She's an awful tenderfoot,\" replied Bo.

That incident is believed to be the first attack on a foreign ambassador in South Korea. \n\n-- Kim allegedly harbored sympathies for North Korea, according to Korean media reports. Yonhap reported that Kim had visited North Korea six times between 2006 and 2007, had attempted to erect a memorial for former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il in Seoul, and once set himself on fire in front of the presidential office. \n\n-- He was frequently seen at protests, wearing a beret and blaming U.S. policies for straining relations between North and South Korea. \n\nKim was a member of the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted Lippert at the Thursday event where the attack occurred.

East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam.

The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements, whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates.

The baby was in her arms, and at that moment there was a question as to the godfathers and godmother for the baby. \n\nThe letter from Mrs. Smith had arrived on the last day of October, nearly two months before the birth of the baby, and the telegrams refusing to send the money demanded had been despatched on the 1st November,--so that, at this time, Caldigate's mind was accustomed to the burden of the idea. From that day to this he had not often spoken of the matter to Robert Bolton,--nor indeed had there been much conversation between them on other matters. Robert had asked him two or three times whether he had received any reply by the wires. No such message had come; and of course he answered his brother-in-law's questions accordingly;--but he had answered them almost with a look of offence. The attorney's manner and tone seemed to him to convey reproach; and he was determined that none of the Boltons should have the liberty to find fault with him. It had been suggested, some weeks since, before the baby was born, that an effort should be made to induce Mrs. Bolton to act as godmother. And, since that, among the names of many other relatives and friends, those of uncle Babington and Robert Bolton had been proposed. Hester had been particularly anxious that her brother should be asked, because,--as she so often said to her husband,--he had always been her firm friend in the matter of her marriage. But now, when the question was to be settled, John Caldigate shook his head.

With typical humility, he says he just hopes the film inspires young people. \n\n\"I hope it's a positive message for kids who (are) trying to accomplish their dreams,\" he told ESPN's Bill Williamson. \"I want to show them that there are adversity and obstacles for everyone, but you can make it. I am honestly living my dream, but I had adversity and obstacles. I want kids to get hope from this.\" \n\nYeah, some of you are rolling your eyes. \n\nBut Tebow genuinely believes that. And that's one of the messages of the film, says Chase Heavener, who directed \"Tim Tebow: Everything in Between.\" \n\nTim Tebow is exactly what he appears to be: a hard-working, squeaky-clean, all-American guy. \n\n\"It's really cool to see that it's true. He is who he says he is,\" Heavener said. \n\nHeavener is something of an expert on this subject. He's not just a filmmaker who followed the man who is now arguably the most famous quarterback in America. He's also a friend. \n\nHeavener's dad and Tebow's dad were college roommates and have stayed buddies. That friendship uniquely positioned the younger Heavener to ask the Heisman Trophy winner and two-time national champion to be filmed constantly through winter 2010. \n\nHeavener and his team at Fiction, a video production company, ended up with more than 1,000 hours of film, which were edited to 50 minutes when ESPN picked up the television rights to the project. It was shot in the months between Tebow's last collegiate game and the night he was drafted by the Broncos.

There Ted found his beloved Brownie alive, one of his legs crushed in a steel trap . Frightened, Ted now wished he had taken Spotty's earlier appeals seriously. Then Ted noticed something. Spotty had done something else besides leading Brownie's human owner to his trapped friend. In a circle around the injured dog, Ted found some food remains of every meal. Brownie had been fed that week! Spotty had been visiting Brownie regularly, in the hope of keeping his friend alive.

She was one of the lucky ones. A lot of the animals were killed because of fears they might escape during the bombing and attack people. They included a tiger, a black bear, a wolf, a penguin, and two polar bears. But Sheila was walked down the road by zoo-keepers to a nearby house where a woman took her in and kept her in her backyard for several months until the bombing was over. The woman has never been identified and the zoo knows her only as \"the elephant angel\". As the zoo celebrates its 75thbirthday, people have decided to try to find the elephant's saver. Mark Challis is the manager of Belfast Zoo. He explained a bit more about Sheila's story. \"Well, we know that Sheila, the elephant that was in the zoo at that time spent some time living with a lady relatively near to the zoo and we have one sweet photo, you can see it on our zoo website.\" \"In the photo you can see the elephant with the lady in her back garden and that's almost all we know. So we're just trying to find a little bit more information and we are not even sure if the lady is alive today, but maybe her relatives or somebody will recognize the back of that house and we can fill in some detail on this story.\" Once the bombing was over, Sheila went back to the zoo and lived for another quarter of a century.

He was also the father of Aileen. \n\nBehold him seated in an elegant drawing-room, in a splendid mansion at the \"west end\" (strange that all aristocratic ends would appear to be west ends!) of the seaport town which owned him. His blooming daughter sat beside him at a table, on which lay a small, peculiar, box. He doated on his daughter, and with good reason. Their attention was so exclusively taken up with the peculiar box that they had failed to observe the entrance, unannounced, of a man of rough exterior, who stood at the door, hat in hand, bowing and coughing attractively, but without success. \n\n\"My darling,\" said Mr Hazlit, stooping to kiss his child--his only child--who raised her pretty little three-cornered mouth to receive it, \"this being your twenty-first birthday, I have at last brought myself to look once again on your sainted mother's jewel-case, in order that I may present it to you. I have not opened it since the day she died. It is now yours, my child.\" \n\nAileen opened her eyes in mute amazement. It would seem as though there had been some secret sympathy between her and the man at the door, for he did precisely the same thing.

Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.

The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.

Christianity, an archbishop (, via Latin \"archiepiscopus\", from Greek , from -, \"chief\", and , \"bishop\") is a bishop of higher rank or office.

Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. \n\nEpiscopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which the bishop who is the ordinary of one of them has certain powers and duties of oversight over the other sees. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\"sui iuris\") Eastern Catholic Church are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. \n\nAs well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank. In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as Luxembourg or Monaco, too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province.

She loves soup, and pea soup most of all, even if tomato is pretty good too. She doesn't like vegetable or chicken soup at all. She grows her own peas, mushes them up in the soup, and then stirs it all up with a spoon. She also cooks it on the stove. She loves to cook, and I love to eat.

It was named for Birmingham, England, the UK's second largest city and then major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed smaller neighbors and developed as an industrial and railroad transportation center, based on mining, the new iron and steel industry, and railroading. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry. The city was developed as a place where cheap, non-unionized, and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over unionized industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast. \n\nFrom its founding through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the southern United States. Its growth from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames as \"The Magic City\" and \"The Pittsburgh of the South\". Its major industries were iron and steel production, plus a major component of the railroading industry. Rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham. Since the 1860s, the two primary hubs of railroading in the Deep South have been nearby Atlanta and Birmingham. The economy diversified in the latter half of the 20th century.

The Sterlings are co-owners of the team through a family trust. \n\nDonald Sterling initially indicated he would fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the National Basketball Association. \n\nThe suit has yet to be withdrawn, attorneys Bobby Samini and Maxwell Blecher, said, but that likely will happen this week. \n\n\"Donald Sterling officially announces today, the NBA and Donald Sterling and Shelly Sterling have agreed to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to Steve Ballmer for $2 billion and various additional benefits. All disputes and outstanding issues have been resolved,\" Samini said in a written statement. \n\nBlecher said he thought that Sterling worked out a resolution with the league or with Shelly Sterling. \n\nThe NBA was expected to issue a news release commenting on Wednesday's developments. \n\nAs of 8 p.m. ET, the NBA had not received a sale agreement with Donald Sterling's signature, a source with detailed knowledge of the negotiations said. The source said Sterling was in a room with his two attorneys, going through the deal. \n\nNBA owners still have to approve the sale to Ballmer, who has indicated he would keep the team in Los Angeles.

CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D graphical information independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device. CGM was developed by W3C in 1999 As a metafile, i.e., a file containing information that describes or specifies another file, the CGM format has numerous elements to provide functions and to represent entities, so that a wide range of graphical information and geometric primitives can be accommodated. Rather than establish an explicit graphics file format, CGM contains the instructions and data for reconstructing graphical components to render an image using an object-oriented approach. \n\nAlthough CGM is not widely supported for web pages and has been supplanted by other formats in the graphic arts, it is still prevalent in engineering, aviation, and other technical applications. \n\nThe initial CGM implementation was effectively a streamed representation of a sequence of Graphical Kernel System primitive operations.

Pistorius does not deny shooting her but insists that he mistook her for an intruder. \n\nPistorius said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired. \n\n\"I didn't intend to shoot. My firearm was pointed at the door because that's where I believed that somebody was,\" he said. \"When I heard a noise, I didn't have to think, and I fired -- I fired my weapon. It was an accident.\" \n\nNel, known in South African legal circles for his bulldog-like approach to cross-examination, responded to Pistorius' testimony almost with scorn. \n\n\"Your version is so improbable that nobody would ever think that it was reasonably, possibly true,\" he said. \n\nNel then hammered Pistorius on whether he had known Steenkamp was in the toilet when he fired.

And protecting her kids is taking toll on the family budget. \n\nWhen she was nine months old, Cunningham's four-year-old daughter Elena ate a spoonful of yogurt and broke out in hives. Elena is allergic to eggs, tree nuts, dairy and peanuts, and even brief contact with one of the these hard-to-avoid items is all it takes to set off a potentially life-threatening immune reaction. \n\nCunningham's eight-month-old son Wyatt has a bad dairy allergy too. \n\nIn order to keep their kids safe and healthy, Emily Cunningham, a stay-at-home mother from Charlotte, North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog, and her husband keep a completely allergy-free home, buying only food products that are free of any trace of their children's triggers. \n\nBut that protection comes at a high price. Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine, a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock, the Cunninghams spend about $1,000 a month to safeguard their children from their allergies, and that's before the grocery bill. Emily estimates her family spends $80 a month just on rice milk. \n\nTIME.com: How nut allergies made me monogamous \n\nAbout 4% to 6% of U.S. children under age 18 have food allergies, and the latest statistics show this percentage may be on the rise. \n\nWhy so many kids are experiencing allergies to common food items still isn't clear, although experts suspect that some of the trend can be attributed to improved public health and sanitation efforts that may have made us too clean to build strong enough immunity to common allergens found in food and the environment. Kids not eating things like nuts and shellfish at an earlier age may also contribute to the rise in food allergies.
