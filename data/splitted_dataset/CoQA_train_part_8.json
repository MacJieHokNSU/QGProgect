He had given the girl his advice, and had done so in a manner that was not altogether ineffectual. He had frightened her, and had also frightened Mrs Pipkin. He had taught Mrs Pipkin to believe that the new dispensation was not yet so completely established as to clear her from all responsibility as to her niece's conduct. Having done so much, and feeling that there was no more to be done, he returned home. It was out of the question that he should take Ruby with him. In the first place she would not have gone. And then,--had she gone,--he would not have known where to bestow her. For it was now understood throughout Bungay,--and the news had spread to Beccles,--that old Farmer Ruggles had sworn that his granddaughter should never again be received at Sheep's Acre Farm. The squire on his return home heard all the news from his own housekeeper. John Crumb had been at the farm and there had been a fierce quarrel between him and the old man. The old man had called Ruby by every name that is most distasteful to a woman, and John had stormed and had sworn that he would have punched the old man's head but for his age. He wouldn't believe any harm of Ruby,--or if he did he was ready to forgive that harm. But as for the Baro-nite;--the Baro-nite had better look to himself! Old Ruggles had declared that Ruby should never have a shilling of his money;-hereupon Crumb had anathematised old Ruggles and his money too, telling him that he was an old hunx, and that he had driven the girl away by his cruelty. Roger at once sent over to Bungay for the dealer in meal, who was with him early on the following morning.

The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \"long tidal river\". \n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area, the 29th most populous, and the fourth most densely populated of the 50 United States. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\". It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. Much of southern and western Connecticut (along with the majority of the state's population) is part of the New York metropolitan area; three of Connecticut's eight counties are statistically included in the New York City combined statistical area, which is widely referred to as the Tri-State area.

It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass. \n\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms.

He can't fly like Superman or shoot a sticky web like Spider-Man. \n\nBruce Wayne is born to a wealthy Gotham City business family. However, when his parents are murdered his life changes completely. \n\nWayne feels anger at their deaths and guilty that he did not prevent them. He travels around the world learning how to fight. Upon returning to Gotham, he creates a disguise to enable him to fight crime without being recognized. \n\nA childhood fear of bats leads him to choose to dress as one. His idea is that through the bat person he can prove to himself that he has overcome his childhood fears. \n\nWayne is the CEO of the company he inherits from his father. He seems to live the lifestyle of a millionaire playboy. But this is a ruse . He works hard at the image to allow himself the freedom he needs to do his work as a crime fighter. \"Bruce Wayne, playboy\" is the disguise Batman is the real person. \n\n\"Wayne is not a born superhero.

In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean \"those who serve in close attendance to the nobility\", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai. According to Wilson, an early reference to the word \"samurai\" appears in the Kokin Wakash\u016b (905\u2013914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century. \n\nBy the end of the 12th century, samurai became almost entirely synonymous with bushi, and the word was closely associated with the middle and upper echelons of the warrior class. The samurai were usually associated with a clan and their lord, were trained as officers in military tactics and grand strategy, and they followed a set of rules that later came to be known as the bushid\u014d.

Everybody was happy. The play had been quite as successful as the usual amateur performance.

But the audience bore no malice. No collection of individuals is less vindictive than an audience at amateur theatricals. It was all over now. Charteris had literally gibbered in the presence of eye-witnesses at one point in the second act, when Spennie, by giving a wrong cue, had jerked the play abruptly into act three, where his colleagues, dimly suspecting something wrong, but not knowing what it was, had kept it for two minutes, to the mystification of the audience. But, now Charteris had begun to forget. As he two-stepped down the room, the lines of agony on his face were softened. He even smiled. \n\nAs for Spennie, the brilliance of his happy grin dazzled all beholders. \n\nHe was still wearing it when he invaded the solitude of Mr. McEachern. In every dance, however greatly he may be enjoying it, there comes a time when a man needs a meditative cigarette apart from the throng. It came to Spennie after the seventh item on the program. The billiard-room struck him as admirably suitable in every way.

In the front, on the right, ran the long bar with its shining brass and polished mahogany (he prided himself on having the best bar west of Denver), and in the rear, occupying both sides of the room, stood two long rows of faro and roulette outfits, together with card-tables and dice-boards. It was the largest and most prosperous gambling hall in the camps, and always of an evening was crowded with gamesters and those who came as lookers-on. \n\nOn the right side, in a raised seat about midway of the hall, Haney usually sat, a handsome figure, in broad white hat, immaculate linen, and well-cut frock-coat, his face as pale as that of a priest in the glare of the big electric light. On the other side, and directly opposite, Williams kept corresponding \"lookout\" over the dealers and the crowd. He was a bold man who attempted any shenanigan with Mart Haney, and the games of his halls were reported honest. \n\nTo think of a young and innocent girl married to this remorseless gambler, scarred with the gun and the knife, was a profanation of maidenhood--and yet, as he fell now and then into a dream, he took on a kind of savage beauty which might allure and destroy a woman.

Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of European immigrants. It became a prime destination for African-Americans in the Great Migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950. \n\nBased on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy after 1960, Philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the USA and often overseas. As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government.

Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. \n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, \"Impression, soleil levant\" (\"Impression, Sunrise\"), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper \"Le Charivari\". \n\nThe development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature. \n\nRadicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and J. M. W. Turner. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes were usually painted in a studio. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting \"en plein air\". They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour\u2014not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary\u2014to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Was this form liked at first?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "where does the name come from?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which one?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where did this form start?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What does it consist of?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Why wasn't it liked?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did it follow traditional rules?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What were they called because of that?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who were they following?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What else did they do?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What came after this art form?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What kinds?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Before this, where was art created?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Inside or Outside?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What phrase describes where they painted?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did they hide their strokes?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What else could be shown?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Were they large?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 553, "span_end": 577, "span_text": " faced harsh opposition ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 659, "span_end": 691, "span_text": "the title of a Claude Monet work", "input_text": "the title of a Claude Monet work", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 719, "span_text": "\"Impression, soleil levant", "input_text": "\"Impression, soleil levant\"", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 428, "span_end": 433, "span_text": "Paris", "input_text": "Paris", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 516, "span_end": 533, "span_text": "1870s and 1880s.

Dick sent a nice book to Dora, and Tom and Sam sent books to Grace and Nellie. The boys also united in the gift of a stick pin to Mrs. Stanhope and another to Mrs. Laning, and sent Mr. Laning a necktie. Captain Putnam was not forgotten, and they likewise remembered George Strong. The rest of their purchases they took home, for distribution there. \n\nA number of the other students had come as far as Ithaca with them, and here the crowd had dinner at one of the hotels,--the same place where Tom had once played his great joke on Josiah Crabtree. \n\n\"By the way, who knows anything about Nick Pell?\" asked one of the students, while dining. \n\n\"He has been removed to his home in the city,\" answered George Granbury. \n\n\"Is he better?\" questioned Dick. \n\n\"They say he is better some days, but at other times he is worse.

Mrs Mangivik was sitting opposite to her mending a seal-skin boot, and Cowlik the easy-going was seated beside her, engaged with some other portion of native attire. Nootka was busy over the cooking-lamp, and old Mangivik himself was twirling his thumbs, awaiting the result of her labours. Oolalik was there too--he was frequently there--courting Nootka in the usual way, by prolonged silent staring. The process might have been trying to some women, but Nootka did not mind. Like many young damsels, she was fond of admiration, and could stand a good deal of it, no matter how peculiar the mode in which it was expressed. \n\n\"I don't care to go,\" said Adolay, with a sigh. \n\nCheenbuk did not repeat the invitation or press for a reason. He was a considerate as well as a gallant youth. He knew that the poor girl was pining for her parents, and that she regretted having left them--even although remaining in her native village might have involved her being wed against her will to the hated Magadar, or subjected to his persecutions during her father's absence.

Yours are obvious by their absence and I feel sorry for you.\" These were the words that Carolyn Bourne e-mailed to her son's fiancee , Heidi Withers. The couple had just visited the Bourne family home in England. Within days, the e-mail was all over the Internet, and the subject of manners hit UK national news. Heidi, Mrs Bourne said, stayed in bed too late. She complained when she was hungry and was particular about food. She told rude jokes. Finally, she had never thanked Mrs Bourne for the weekend. But it wasn't just Heidi's behavior that got people talking. Facebook groups started up about the e-mail. The one with the most members was called \"Carolyn Bourne needs to learn some manners\". People said Mrs Bourne had been too direct. They thought she had been cruel when she told Heidi to go to \"finishing school\" -- a centre where badly-behaved young women used to be sent. Heidi's father wrote back to Mrs Bourne and called her a \"snotty Miss Fancy Pants\" -- someone who thinks they are socially better than anyone else. Everyone agreed that there are rules of \"good\" and \"bad\" behavior. Everyone agreed that these rules had been broken. However, no one could agree what these rules were -- or whether Heidi or Mrs Bourne was in the wrong. So what does politeness really mean? Is there a secret to social etiquette ? Shirley Schomaker runs a real-life finishing school. She said that both Mrs Bourne and Heidi had been impolite. The true secret, she said in a BBC interview, lies in making everyone feel comfortable. \"Social etiquette isn't about being snotty and being in the know ,\" she said. \"It's about making other people feel good. It's about communication. It's about making society get along better.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What did Heidi's father call Mrs Bourne?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "which means?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does Mrs Schomaker do?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does she think?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "who was she talking to", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "how many things does she mention when talking about social etiquette?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what's it about?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What had Heidi done wrong?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "anythig else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "anything else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "was that it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did Mrs Bourne say all this to her son?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did she speak to Heidi face to face?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1005, "span_end": 1028, "span_text": "snotty Miss Fancy Pants", "input_text": "snotty Miss Fancy Pants", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1033, "span_end": 1093, "span_text": "someone who thinks they are socially better than anyone else", "input_text": "someone who thinks they are socially better than anyone else", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1408, "span_end": 1442, "span_text": " runs a real-life finishing school", "input_text": "runs a real-life finishing school", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1444, "span_end": 1501, "span_text": "She said that both Mrs Bourne and Heidi had been impolite", "input_text": "She said that both Mrs Bourne and Heidi had been impolite", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1532, "span_end": 1547, "span_text": "a BBC interview", "input_text": "a BBC interview", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1592, "span_end": 1655, "span_text": "Social etiquette isn't about being snotty and being in the know", "input_text": "Social etiquette isn't about being snotty and being in the know", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1670, "span_end": 1780, "span_text": "It's about making other people feel good.

He says the group's latest research also shows that Americans this year are spending more on technology products. \n\n\"Here in 2012, $252 on average-the technology spend for consumers this year.\" From tablet computers to smartphones, American shoppers have been lining up to get the newest and coolest electronic devices on the market. There are more choices today than ever before. \"It's kind of hard to make a decision.\" \n\nTablet computers are one of the best-selling products this year. Brian Tong is Senior Editor of CNET.com. The website reports on tech news and examines the latest electronic products. He says the Apple iPad Mini is one of the most popular tablets. Its starting price is $329. One of Apple's biggest competitors is the Google Nexus 7. It starts at $199. \n\n\"The hardware inside is more powerful than what's in the iPad Mini, but also it offers you a lot of things like maps that work better than Apple's maps.\" Brian Tong says there is one reason why people may like the iPad Mini more than the Nexus 7. \"If you just want to read books and surf the Internet, you don't really need to get an iPad Mini, but if you want the largest group of apps that's where the iPad and Apple's ecosystem shines the most.\" \n\nElman Chacon is with the electronics store Best Buy.

This makes it easy for users to email or upload photographs directly from the camera. \"You can literally take a picture, upload it into your Facebook in a matter of seconds. These things are pretty cool because they do a lot of things.\" \n\nStreaming media boxes also connect to the Internet. People are able to watch web content such as movies and YouTube videos on their televisions. Another popular item is wireless speaker systems. The newest ones work with any device that has Bluetooth technology, including smartphones, laptops and tablets. \n\nWith the growing popularity of Internet shopping, many consumers will visit a store first to look at a product, and then go online to find it at a lower price.

During that leg of the trip, \"everything was fine,\" he said. \n\nFrom Guatemala he crossed into Mexico and made it with a large group of migrants to the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. \n\nThree cars surrounded the vehicle he was riding in, and a group of heavily armed men stepped out, forcing him into another car. \n\nThe migrants were taken to a house, where they were tied up in groups of four, Lala said. \n\nThen, at one point, the hostages were all thrown on the ground, face-down. \n\n\"I heard them shooting at my friends,\" he said. \"They shot me and they killed everyone else.\" \n\nFrom the broadcast portions of the interview, it was not clear what the motive for the massacre might have been. \n\nAs soon as the gunmen finished, they left the premises, Lala said. \n\n\"When they left I waited two minutes, got up and left the house,\" he said.

Yet Honington was the birthplace of Robert Bloomfield, known as \"the Suffolk poet\" in the early part of the last century (although Crabbe was living then and was great, as he is becoming again after many years); while at Sapiston, the rustic village on the other side of the old stone bridge, he acquired that love of nature and intimate knowledge of farm life and work which came out later in his Farmer's Boy. Finally, Troston, the little village in which I write, was the home of Capel Lofft, a person of importance in his day, who discovered Bloomfield, found a publisher for his poems, and boomed it with amazing success. \n\nI dare say it will only provoke a smile of amusement in readers of literary taste when I confess that Bloomfield's memory is dear to me; that only because of this feeling for the forgotten rustic who wrote rhymes I am now here, strolling about in the shade of the venerable trees in Troston Park-the selfsame trees which the somewhat fantastic Capel knew in his day as \"Homer,\" \"Sophocles,\" \"Virgil,\" \"Milton,\" and by other names, calling each old oak, elm, ash, and chestnut after one of the immortals.

She really was blue-blood from the beginning with her father, a wealthy English banker, and her mother, a Dutch baroness . After her parents divorced, Audrey went to London with her mother where she went to a private girls school. In World War II she fell on hard times during the Nazi occupation, and Audrey suffered from depression and malnutrition. After the liberation she headed to America to try her luck there. \n\nAudrey gained immediate prominence in the US with her role in Roman Holiday in 1953. This film turned out to be a smashing success as she won an Oscar as Best Actress. This gained her enormous popularity and more roles. Roman Holiday was followed by another similarly wonderful performance in the 1957 classic Funny Face. Sabrina, in 1954, for which she received another Academy nomination, and Love in the Afternoon, in 1957, also garnered rave reviews . One of Audrey's most radiant roles was in the fine production of My Fair Lady, in 1964. Her co-star Rex Harrison once was asked to identify his favorite leading lady. Without hesitation, he replied, \"Audrey Hepburn in MY FAIR LADY\". After a couple of other movies, she gained another nomination in 1967's Wait Until Dark. \n\nBy the end of the sixties, after her divorce from actor Mel Ferrer, Audrey decided to retire while she was on top. Later she married Dr. Andrea Dotti. From time to time, she would appear on the silver screen. In 1988, Audrey became a special ambassador to the United Nations UNICEF(United Nations Children's Fund)fund helping children in Latin America and Africa, a position she retained until 1993. She was named to People's magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Her last film was Always in 1989. Audrey Hepburn died on January 20, 1993 in Tolochnaz, Switzerland.

The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress. In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world. \n\nGellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy \u2013 or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call \"humane\" or \"polite\" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves \"humanists\". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 \u2013 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.", "questions": [{"input_text": "In Italy, who called themselves humanists?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What years was Cicero alive?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was his occupation?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did he say was the difference between man and beasts?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What did he say the benefit of that was?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was Gellius attitude?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did he term as being nice to people?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Gellius become?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many different definitions did we end up with on the topic of discussion?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Does the topic include God or not?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was what uneducated people's opinions included?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1127, "span_end": 1324, "span_text": "Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves \"humanists\"", "input_text": "teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1350, "span_end": 1388, "span_text": ", point out that Cicero (106 \u2013 43 BCE)", "input_text": "(106 \u2013 43 BCE)", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1545, "span_end": 1622, "span_text": " For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech,", "input_text": "a lawyer", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1568, "span_end": 1645, "span_text": "what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reaso", "input_text": "speech", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1568, "span_end": 1760, "span_text": "what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law", "input_text": "it enabled them to settle disputes and live together", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 757, "span_end": 843, "span_text": "Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy ", "input_text": "humanitas", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1126, "span_end": 1186, "span_text": " Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance", "input_text": "a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1127, "span_end": 1220, "span_text": "Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy,", "input_text": "The fifteenth century", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1762, "span_end": 1949, "span_text": "Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 99, "span_text": "Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "HumanismHumanism_09cd61ca2dbe3a67b98bba7d348b067d297798e66677c5c0ead94fdc"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3duzq9u6smodzwnuaj1skp1ralrvsf", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Lyman Frank Baum___Aunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross.txt/CHAPTER I_b36ddb3879d5503ba99e40311cde2f56134018efdfc067c08c55cab", "story": "CHAPTER I \n\nTHE ARRIVAL OF THE BOY \n\n\"What's the news, Uncle?\" asked Miss Patricia Doyle, as she entered the cosy breakfast room of a suite of apartments in Willing Square.

She came to discuss trade and environmental issues with China's top leaders. Germany's first woman leader is known as a brave and practical statesman . Even since her time at school, she had the habit of getting everything in order. Every day before doing her homework she would clean the desk and think about what to do next. \"I prefer a long time for full preparations to make my decision. But once I decide, I will stand up for what I believe,\" Merkel said. \n\nPerhaps it was good habits that helped her do well in her studies. At 32, she got a doctorate in physics and then she worked as a researcher. \n\nHowever, the life of a scholar couldn't put off her love of politics. While working in labs, Merkel took time off to read political books and at last joined a political party. \"Her calmness helped her stand out in the party. She could always find a way out while others felt hopeless,\" said one of her old friends. \n\nIn her first big political job as Minister for the Environment in 1994, her scientific background proved very useful.

At the EU summit in 2005 when France quarreled with Britain over the EU budget , some people believed the EU was close to breaking down. But Merkel didn't give up.

He was one of the people who made Silicon Valley the capital of technological invention. Author and business consultant Jim Collins once called Jobs the \"Beethoven of business\". When asked what Steve Jobs will be best remembered for, many of us would name a particular product:the iPod, the iPhone or the iPad, for example. But in the eyes of Eric Jackson, a reporter with Forbes magazine, Jobs brought the world much more than these popular devices . Here are some of the lessons he taught us: \n\n1. The most lasting inventions mix art and science. Jobs pointed out that the team members working with Apple were trained in anthropology , art, history, and poetry. He believed this was important in making Apple's products stand out. \n\n2. Never fear failure. Jobs was fired by the successor he himself chose. It was one of the most public embarrassments of the last 30 years in business. However, Jobs didn't hide away or try to get a new job. He _ and got back to work. \n\n3. You can't look forward to connecting the dots--you can only look backward. This means that, however much we try to plan things ahead of time, life is always full of unexpected things.

But he is also a firm believer in creating your own luck: being prepared when the magic unfolds on the pitch. \n\n\"I think knowledge of the sport is particularly important, because certain players have different styles,\" the Briton tells CNN's Sports Photo Masterclass series. \n\n\"A midfielder is more creative; he's always going to be looking for that pass.

About 50 students participated in a 30-minute workout after school on Friday in the school's gym. This was a Fit Fridays program introduced at the school by Families Plus, a non-profit group that provides programs to enrich the lives of families and children in Frederick County. The free program aims to encourage students from kindergarten through fifth grade to be physically active by having them participate in various age-appropriate activities designed to promote a love of exercise, according to Kim Ragan, head of the program. The program, which started at the school on Nov.9, 2012, has since become a hit, Ragan said.

At first that rather remarkable young lady, Stella, had alarmed him somewhat, so that he convinced himself that the duties of this novel hospitality would prove irksome.

Now that she had procured some suitable clothes the young lady was distinctly good looking; she was remarkably intelligent and well-read; she sang, as Stephen Layard had said, \"like an angel\"; she took a most enlightened interest in aerophones and their possibilities; she proved a very useful assistant in various experiments; and made one or two valuable suggestions. While Mary and the rest of them were away the place would really be dull without her, and somehow he could not be as sorry as he ought when Dr. Charters told him that old Mr. Fregelius's bones were uniting with exceeding slowness. \n\nSuch were the conclusions which one by one took shape in the mind of that ill-starred man, Morris Monk. As yet, however, let the student of his history understand, they were not tinged with the slightest \"arriere-pensee.\" He did not guess even that such relations as already existed between Stella and himself might lead to grievous trouble; that at least they were scarcely wise in the case of a man engaged.

For comparison, Melissa McCarthy's last major film Bridesmaids (though it was in a supporting role) opened at $26.2 million, in 2,918 theaters. With an opening like this, big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon's R-rated comedy which has already surpassed its $35 million production budget. Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a $28.3 million opening weekend in July 2011, Bateman hasn't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles. Universal's The Change-Up (with Ryan Reynolds) opened at $13.5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only $37.1 million domestically, on a $52 million production budget. \n\nJonathan Levine's Warm Bodies took second place for its second weekend with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $36.7 million. This breaks Levine's record, beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature, the cancer dramedy 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which brought in $35 million. \n\nThe R-rated Hitchcock-style, prescription-drug thriller Side Effects (CinemaScore: B) ended up beating director Steven Soderbergh's January 2012 weekend opening of Haywire, earning $10 million weekend this weekend and averaging $3,845 per theater. We talked a little bit about stars Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum's box office history yesterday. Another star of Side Effects is Jude Law, and he's got a varied track record at the box office. He generally participates in ensemble casts -- Anna Karenina, the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Soderbergh's Contagion, The Holiday -- making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive. Side Effects has Soderbergh's name and another strong ensemble, and could go on to a respectable run, even though it won't reach Contagion heights (the epidemic thriller eventually grossed $76 million).

Washington, assisted by Dr. Craik, watched with assiduity over his comrades, Orme and Morris.

Here, too, flying reports had preceded them, brought by fugitives from the battle; who, with the disposition usual in such cases to exaggerate, had represented the whole army as massacred. Fearing these reports might reach home, and affect his family, Washington wrote to his mother, and his brother, John Augustine, apprising them of his safety. \"The Virginia troops,\" says he, in a letter to his mother, \"showed a good deal of bravery, and were nearly all killed. ... The dastardly behavior of those they called regulars exposed all others, that were ordered to do their duty, to almost certain death; and, at last, in despite of all the efforts of the officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pursued by dogs, and it was impossible to rally them.\" \n\nTo his brother, he writes: \"As I have heard, since my arrival at this place, a circumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I take this early opportunity of contradicting the first, and of assuring you that I have not composed the latter.

The ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973, it was designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a \"consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation.\" The U.S. Supreme Court found that \"the plain intent of Congress in enacting\" the ESA \"was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\" The Act is administered by two federal agencies, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \n\nOne species in particular received widespread attention\u2014the whooping crane. The species' historical range extended from central Canada South to Mexico, and from Utah to the Atlantic coast.

After eighteen years, strange news concerning the doctor had just come from Paris. Mr. Lorry, told Lucie, \"your father has been found. He is alive, greatly changed, but alive. He has been taken to the house of a former servant in Paris, and we are going there.\" On arrival, the banker and Lucie were taken to an attic, where a haggard , white-haired man sat on a low bench, making shoes. He was sheltered by a man by the name of Defarge who, with his wife, kept a wine-shop in the district of St. Antoine. Charles Darnay was of noble birth; but his ancestors had for many years so cruelly oppressed the French peasants that the name of Evremonde was hated and looked down upon. Unlike them in character, this last descendant of his race had given up his name and wealth and had come to England as a private gentleman, eager to begin a new life. Sydney Carton was a young English lawyer. _ soon became frequent visitors at the small house in Soho Square, the home of Doctor Manette and his daughter. Through Lucie's care and devotion, the doctor had almost completely recovered from the effects of his long imprisonment, and it was only in times of strong excitement that any trace of his past foolish behaviors could be discovered. The sweet face of Lucie Manette soon won the hearts of both the young men, but it was Darnay to whom she gave her love. They married. The French Revolution had actually begun and in 1792 Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay landed in Paris, the former to protect the French branch of Tellson & Co. and the latter to help an old family servant -Gabelle-who had begged his help. Not until they had set foot in Paris did they realize what a caldron of fury they had been involved in. Mr. Lorry, on account of his business relations, was allowed his freedom, but Darnay was hurried at once to the prison of La Force, there to wait for his trial. The reason given for this outrage was the new law for the arrest of all returning French emigrants , but the true cause was that he had been recognized as Charles Evremonde. Doctor Manette, going to France with Lucie, gained a promise that Darnay's life should be spared. At last came the terrible year of the Reign of Terror. The sympathy which at first had been given to Doctor Manette had become weakened through the influence of Mrs. Defarge. Also, there had been found in the ruins of the Bastille a paper which contained Doctor Manette's account of his imprisonment, and pronouncing a curse upon the House of Evremonde and their descendants, who were responsible for his eighteen years of misery. Charles Darnay's fate was sealed. \"Death within twenty-four hours.\" To Sydney Carton, who had followed his friends to Paris, came an inspiration. He once promised Lucie that he would die to save a life she loved. He managed to gain admission to the prison; Darnay was removed unconscious from the cell, and Carton sat down to wait for his fate. Along the Paris streets six tumbrels were carrying the day's wine to La Guillotine. In the third car sat a young man with his hands tied. As the cries from the street arose against him, they only move him to a quiet smile as he shook more loosely his hair about his face. Crash! A head is held up. The third cart came up, and the supposed Evremonde came down. His lips move, forming the words, \"a life you love.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What happened to Dr. Manette?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Did they try to figure out what became of him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who took care of Lucie?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was wrong with the man's hands in the third car?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did Dan come from nobility?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where was the wine shop?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did Lucie's father turn up?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was he alive?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was he the same?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How old was Lucie, then?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What country was reporting his appearance?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did they head there to see him?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who did Lucie fall for?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Did they have nuptials?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who was Gabelle?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Where did Darnay end up hurried to?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Why in the world did they arrest him?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was the real reason, though?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Did they agree to let him live?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "Who was going to sacrifice himself to save him?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "Who had Dr. Manette cursed?", "turn_id": 22}, {"input_text": "Did he trade places with the doctor?", "turn_id": 23}, {"input_text": "How many years of misery had the doctor suffered?", "turn_id": 24}, {"input_text": "Had he also cursed generations to come?", "turn_id": 25}, {"input_text": "What was Mr. Lorry's occupation?", "turn_id": 26}, {"input_text": "Did Darnay's distant family treat peasants terribly?", "turn_id": 27}, {"input_text": "What did Sydney do for a living?", "turn_id": 28}], "answers": [{"span_start": 7, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "Manette had suddenly disappeared.", "input_text": "He disappeared.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 41, "span_end": 104, "span_text": "Everything was done to discover some trace of him, but in vain.", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 282, "span_end": 335, "span_text": "left little Lucie under the guardianship of Mr. Lorry", "input_text": "Mr. Lorry.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 3342, "span_end": 3387, "span_text": "third car sat a young man with his hands tied", "input_text": "His hands were tied.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 843, "span_end": 878, "span_text": "Charles Darnay was of noble birth; ", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 801, "span_end": 841, "span_text": "wine-shop in the district of St. Antoine", "input_text": "St. Antoine.", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 444, "span_end": 470, "span_text": "your father has been found", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 472, "span_end": 485, "span_text": "He is alive, ", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 485, "span_end": 501, "span_text": "greatly changed,", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 337, "span_end": 358, "span_text": "After eighteen years,", "input_text": "Twenty.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 367, "span_end": 419, "span_text": "news concerning the doctor had just come from Paris.", "input_text": "Paris.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 574, "span_end": 597, "span_text": "and we are going there.", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1655, "span_end": 1687, "span_text": "Darnay to whom she gave her love", "input_text": "Darnay.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1689, "span_end": 1701, "span_text": "They married", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1882, "span_end": 1903, "span_text": "an old family servant", "input_text": "A servant.", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 2119, "span_end": 2172, "span_text": " Darnay was hurried at once to the prison of La Force", "input_text": "Prison.", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2180, "span_end": 2202, "span_text": "to wait for his trial.", "input_text": "Awaiting his trial.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 2245, "span_end": 2301, "span_text": "new law for the arrest of all returning French emigrants", "input_text": "A new law.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 2312, "span_end": 2376, "span_text": "true cause was that he had been recognized as Charles Evremonde.", "input_text": "He was recognized as Charles Evremonde.", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 2421, "span_end": 2473, "span_text": "gained a promise that Darnay's life should be spared", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 20}, {"span_start": 3080, "span_end": 3117, "span_text": "he would die to save a life she loved", "input_text": "Sydney Carton.", "turn_id": 21}, {"span_start": 2794, "span_end": 2827, "span_text": "curse upon the House of Evremonde", "input_text": "The House of Evremonde.", "turn_id": 22}, {"span_start": 3209, "span_end": 3251, "span_text": "and Carton sat down to wait for his fate.

But of his successor, the unfortunately famous Dr. Knappe, we may think as of a good enough fellow driven distraught. Fond of Samoa and the Samoans, he thought to bring peace and enjoy popularity among the islanders; of a genial, amiable, and sanguine temper, he made no doubt but he could repair the breach with the English consul. Hope told a flattering tale. He awoke to find himself exchanging defiances with de Coetlogon, beaten in the field by Mataafa, surrounded on the spot by general exasperation, and disowned from home by his own government. The history of his administration leaves on the mind of the student a sentiment of pity scarcely mingled. \n\nOn Blacklock he did not call, and, in view of Leary's attitude, may be excused. But the English consul was in a different category. England, weary of the name of Samoa, and desirous only to see peace established, was prepared to wink hard during the process and to welcome the result of any German settlement. It was an unpardonable fault in Becker to have kicked and buffeted his ready-made allies into a state of jealousy, anger, and suspicion. Knappe set himself at once to efface these impressions, and the English officials rejoiced for the moment in the change. Between Knappe and de Coetlogon there seems to have been mutual sympathy; and, in considering the steps by which they were led at last into an attitude of mutual defiance, it must be remembered that both the men were sick,--Knappe from time to time prostrated with that formidable complaint, New Guinea fever, and de Coetlogon throughout his whole stay in the islands continually ailing.

After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did. \n\nThe wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, \"I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world.\" \n\nSince there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise. \n\nIn time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him. And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad.

But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince. \n\n\"I thank you my lady,\" he said, \"for saving me from the evil wizard.

He says the group's latest research also shows that Americans this year are spending more on technology products. \"Here in 2012, $252 on average-the technology spend for consumers this year.\" From tablet computers to smartphones, American shoppers have been lining up to get the newest and coolest electronic devices on the market. There are more choices today than ever before. \"It's kind of hard to make a decision.\" Tablet computers are one of the best-selling products this year. Brian Tong is Senior Editor of CNET.com. The website reports on tech news and examines the latest electronic products. He says the Apple iPad Mini is one of the most popular tablets. Its starting price is $329. One of Apple's biggest competitors is the Google Nexus 7. It starts at $199. \"The hardware inside is more powerful than what's in the iPad Mini, but also it offers you a lot of things like maps that work better than Apple's maps.\" Brian Tong says there is one reason why people may like the iPad Mini more than the Nexus 7. \"If you just want to read books and surf the Internet, you don't really need to get an iPad Mini, but if you want the largest group of apps that's where the iPad and Apple's ecosystem shines the most.\" Elman Chacon is with the electronics store Best Buy. He says another hot product this season is smart cameras. They connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi. This makes it easy for users to email or upload photographs directly from the camera. \"You can literally take a picture, upload it into your Facebook in a matter of seconds. These things are pretty cool because they do a lot of things.\" Streaming media boxes also connect to the Internet. People are able to watch web content such as movies and YouTube videos on their televisions. Another popular item is wireless speaker systems. The newest ones work with any device that has Bluetooth technology, including smartphones, laptops and tablets. With the growing popularity of Internet shopping, many consumers will visit a store first to look at a product, and then go online to find it at a lower price. Stores like Best Buy understand that and they want to stay competitive. \"We have something called the perfect match promise which means if you buy a certain device and you find it cheaper within 30 days we'll go ahead and price match that for you.\" Elman Chacon said.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the starting price of the Apple iPad Mini?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who is Steve Koenig with?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was the most wanted holiday gifts in the season, according to the article?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What percent of gift-givers will get at least one technology product?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Are Americans this year spending more on technology products?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who does Brian Tong work for?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is his position there?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is one of the iPad Mini's stiffest competitors?", "turn_id": 8}], "answers": [{"span_start": 953, "span_end": 1037, "span_text": " the Apple iPad Mini is one of the most popular tablets.

She felt it would be wiser and better to have no more than a casual acquaintance with him. \n\nShe had a scheme for going to St Petersburg, where she had a friend who was a sculptor like herself, and who lived with a wealthy Russian whose hobby was jewel-making. The emotional, rather rootless life of the Russians appealed to her. She did not want to go to Paris. Paris was dry, and essentially boring. She would like to go to Rome, Munich, Vienna, or to St Petersburg or Moscow. She had a friend in St Petersburg and a friend in Munich. To each of these she wrote, asking about rooms. \n\nShe had a certain amount of money. She had come home partly to save, and now she had sold several pieces of work, she had been praised in various shows. She knew she could become quite the 'go' if she went to London.

Paley put the radio network's news operation at the same level as entertainment, and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted. Along with other networks, CBS chafed at the breaking news embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services, which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print. CBS disregarded an embargo when it broke the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, using live on-the-air reporting.

Instead of the infomercials aired by most private stations, or a simulcast of CBC News Network in the style of BBC One's nightly simulcast of BBC News Channel, the CBC uses the time to air repeats, including local news, primetime series, movies and other programming from the CBC library. Its French counterpart, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, still signs off every night. \n\nUntil 1998, the network carried a variety of American programs in addition to its core Canadian programming, directly competing with private Canadian broadcasters such as CTV and Global. Since then, it has restricted itself to Canadian programs, a handful of British programs, and a few American movies and off-network repeats. Since this change, the CBC has sometimes struggled to maintain ratings comparable to those it achieved before 1995, although it has seen somewhat of a ratings resurgence in recent years.

They also have parapodia for locomotion. Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes (almost all marine), oligochaetes (which include earthworms) and leech-like species. Cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme, viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a sub-group of polychaetes. In addition, the Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula, previously regarded as separate phyla, are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes. Annelids are considered members of the Lophotrochozoa, a \"super-phylum\" of protostomes that also includes molluscs, brachiopods, flatworms and nemerteans. \n\nThe basic annelid form consists of multiple segments. Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most polychaetes, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. Septa separate the segments of many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation. In species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts. The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which facilitates movement by peristalsis (\"ripples\" that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia.

She firmly believed that this tree heard and understood and sympathised with all that she said.

He wrote reviews, columns, interviews and articles, an astonishing collection of work that spanned more than four decades with the Chicago Sun-Times, freelance contributions for magazines such as Esquire, CD-ROMs (Ebert's movie guide was one of the sources for the popular Cinemania) and rogerebert.com. He hosted festivals for underappreciated films. He gave running travelogues from Cannes and Toronto. \n\nHe tweeted, Facebooked, corresponded with film lovers and held court with words long after his physical voice was silenced by cancer a decade ago. \n\nEbert lost his battle with cancer Thursday. He was 70. \n\nWhat a voice he had: firm, plain, brooking no claptrap and telling you exactly what he thought, a throwback, he said, to his newspaper reporter days. (Chicago, then and now, was full of such cheerily blunt personalities: Mike Royko, Irv Kupcinet, Studs Terkel -- perhaps to be expected in the birthplace of \"The Front Page.\") \n\nOpinion: Ebert's sheer love of life \n\nAbove all, he was easy to relate to. Like many of his readers, I didn't always agree with Ebert, but I could understand his viewpoint. He understood movies were these complex machines of directors and actors and special effects guys and studio suits holding bags of money, machines that -- when they worked -- were magical, like dreams.

The Oscar winning Russel Crowe has put himself in line for further honors with his acting John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician troubled by schizophrenia . A Beautiful Mind pictures Nash as an unusual hero, not just because of his academic achievements, but also because of the courage he displays while battling his illness. In 1947, Nash was one of many great young minds at Princeton. \"To find a truly original idea is the only way to distinguish myself.\" The proud and determined student declared. His exploration of such an idea afforded him little time for the normal socializing. His shyness and straightforward approach brought him few friends. After finally _ a revolutionary new idea, Nash's career took off and his reputation was secured. He balanced research work with teaching, which is where he met the bright and beautiful student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).

For years, scientists said \"no.\" or \"we don't know.\" But today this is changing. Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers .

The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\" say Shostak and Barnett. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \"Tools like the Hubble Telescope have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\" says Shostak. \"And our galaxy, the Milky Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\" In the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth--in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life. Have beings from space already visited Earth? \"Probably not,\" says Shostak. \"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signals .

My dad was a police officer, and we lived in the city. I really enjoyed the time when I could go to the quiet countryside. One day I saw my very first wild snake and I knew that's what I would do for the rest of my life. I didn't know if I would be a teacher or a zookeeper, but I knew I would have a life connected with nature. Reporter: Why did you write the book?

She is regarded as one of the most talented actresses of all time. The following is a list of movies that Meryl Streep has been involved with: \n\nKramer vs. Krammer (1979) \n\nIn the film, Meryl plays a mother caught up in a custody dispute . Her co-star, Dustin Hoffman, said, \"She's extraordinarily hardworking. I think she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing.\" Meryl won her first Oscar for her performance in this film. \n\nSophie's Choice (1982) \n\nMeryl plays Sophie, a Polish war survivor. To prepare for the role she learned to speak German and perfected a Polish accent. Film critic Roger Ebert said, \"This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most natural performances I can imagine.\" Meryl won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance. \n\nOut of Africa(1985) \n\nMeryl is Karen Blixen, a Danish woman living in Kenya in the early 20th century. The story follows Karens attempts to run a coffee plantation and her love affair with big-game hunter Denys. The film is based on the memoirs of the real Karen Blixen. \n\nA Cry in the Dark (1995) \n\nThis is based on the true-life case of the disappearance of baby Azaria. Meryl plays Linda Chamberlain, a mother who is wrongly accused of killing her own child. After spending four years in prison, it was found that wild dogs had taken away the baby. Meryl won Best Actress at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nThe Bridge of Madison County (1995) \n\nThis movie is based on one of the biggest bestsellers of the 20th century (the book sold 50 million copies worldwide). Meryl plays Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride living in 1960s Iowa. It's about her brief affair with photographer Robert Kincaid. \n\nMamma Mial(2008) \n\nThis is a romantic comedy based on the stage musical Mamma Mial, featuring the music from 1970s Swedish pop group ABBA. Meryl plays Donna Sheridan, a hotel owner on the Greek island of Kalokairi. Mamma Mial made over U.S. $ 600 million worldwide. Apparently, Meryl had seen the musical in 2001 and was completely absorbed in it. She had no idea that seven years later she'd be in the movie version.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What type of career does Meryl Streep have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was her first movie?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What year was that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was her co-star in that?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did she win any awards with that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did she win?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was her next movie?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What part did she play in that?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What type of character was Sophie?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did she win any awards playing Sophie?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did she win?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was her next movie?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What type of character did she play?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What did she do?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What era was it based on?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Did she play in any other movies?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What was the other movie name?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Did she win any awards for that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What was her latest movie?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What year was that?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "What was the name of the character she played?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "How much money did that movie make?", "turn_id": 22}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 35, "span_text": "Meryl Streep is an American actress", "input_text": "American actress.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 456, "span_end": 516, "span_text": "Meryl won her first Oscar for her performance in this film.

These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow, remained to torture her. \n\nSoftly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano, and opened the door of the outer office. A clock in a steeple near by was striking twelve. The Colonel did not raise his head. Only Stephen saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the door. Then it closed behind her. \n\nFirst of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock. Who had turned it down? Had Clarence? Was he here? Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the room. A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined in the semi-darkness, she knew it. She took a step nearer, and a cry escaped her. \n\nThe man was Eliphalet Hopper.

It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves. \n\nAlbert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and others.

But like the greatest heroes from Shakespeare, it would appear that he was not exempt from the time-honored temptations of human folly and self-destruction. \n\nAnd now the plot is thickening, as details emerge that Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, is involved somehow in the scandal. \n\nAs Americans are coming to terms with the revelation of Petraeus' adultery, on the other side of the Atlantic, the feeling among the French can be summed up by a blas\u00c3\u00a9 shrug. \n\nEvery time a steamy sexual intrigue is laid bare near the corridors of Washington power, the French don't see what all the fuss is about. It's only sex, after all. It's impossible to imagine a French political leader resigning because of an extramarital indiscretion. If this rule were observed, the French parliament would be nearly vacant. \n\nThe Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex \n\nThe past five French presidents are known to have had at least one -- and in some cases, many more -- mistresses throughout their political career. The current resident of the Elys\u00c3\u00a9e Palace, Francois Hollande, has been caught in the middle of an embarrassing dispute between his previous and current female companions. The French, long used to regarding their leaders with cynical detachment, have been following this tormented domestic feud with interest and maybe some contempt.

Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted. \n\nShe smiled and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\" \n\n\"Yes, indeed, mother,\" answered Fred. \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\" \n\nA look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking chair. Fred washed the dishes and put them in the closet. He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school. \n\nFred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes. \n\nHe kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\" \n\nThe doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection. \n\nBesides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school and staying to play after it was dismissed. \n\nThe boys missed him and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was \"Wanted at home.\" \n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton, \"I'll find him out, boys-see if I don't!\" \n\nSo, one morning on his way to school, he called on Fred. As he went around to the side door, he walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was ly needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand. \n\nOf course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess .\"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes!\"\"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\"\"Lost your apron, haven't you, Polly!\" \n\nFred was not wanting either in spirit or in courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors . But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him. \n\nWhile he was struggling for self-mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, \"Don't give up! Be really brave!\" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates. \n\nThe boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said; and so the brave little boy had no further trouble.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What chores did Fred co for his mother?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many days did he do the chores?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What effect did it have on his mom?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did this make Fred happy?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who found out what Fred was doing at home?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "?", "turn_id": 7, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "What did the other boys say when Tom Barton told them what Fred was doing?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "'anything else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What reason did Tom give fohis absence?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 274, "span_end": 301, "span_text": "\"You, Fred, you wash dishes", "input_text": "washed dishes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 846, "span_end": 921, "span_text": "Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide.

The means of plunder were infinite, but of plunder always subject to the danger of an accusation. We remember how Verres calculated that he could divide his spoil into three sufficient parts--one for the lawyers, one for the judges, so as to insure his acquittal, and then one for himself. This plundering was common--so common as to have become almost a matter of course; but it was illegal, and subjected some unfortunate culprits to exile, and to the disgorging of a part of what they had taken. No accusation was made against Cicero. As to others there were constantly threats, if no more than threats. Cicero was not even threatened. But he had saved out of his legitimate expenses a sum equal to \u00a318,000 of our money--from which we may learn how noble were the appanages of a Roman governor. The expenses of all his staff passed through his own hands, and many of those of his army. Any saving effected would therefore be to his own personal advantage. On this money he counted much when his affairs were in trouble, as he was going to join Pompey at Pharsalia in the following year.

Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores).

He was cool and cautious and did not undertake a climb until he was satisfied about his companions' powers. The slanting edge looked dangerous, but was not, although one must be steady and there was an awkward corner. At the turning, the ledge got narrow, and one must seize a knob and then step lightly on a stone embedded in mossy soil. \n\nWhen they reached the spot Hyslop stopped and told Vernon what to do; the girl immediately behind him was a clever mountaineer. They went round and Lister watched from a few yards off. For a moment or two each in turn, supported by one foot with body braced against the rock, grasped the knob and vanished round the corner. It was plain one must get a firm hold, but Lister thought this was all. He was used to the tall skeleton trestles that carried the rails across Canadian ravines. \n\nAfter the others disappeared Lister seized the knob. He thought the stone he stood on moved and he cautiously took a heavier strain on his arm. He could get across, but he obeyed an impulse and gave the stone a push. It rolled out and, when he swung himself back to the ledge, plunged down and smashed upon the rocks below.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama, joined by his family, stepped off Air Force One and onto a rainy runway, where Cuban dignitaries eagerly awaited him. \"It's wonderful to be here, \" the president said. The last time a U.S. president came to Cuba was in 1928. It was President Calvin Coolidge, and he arrived on a battleship. Obama will be in Cuba through Tuesday. He is set to meet with Cuba's president, Raul Castro, attend a state dinner and even take in a baseball game. \n\nThe U.S. cut all ties with Cuba after Fidel Castro's communist government took control of the island in 1959. In the years that followed, both countries' opposing political views furthered the separation. Plans for social and economic change began after President Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, Raul in 2008.

Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium).

During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \"Byzantine Empire\" and \"Eastern Roman Empire\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \"Roman Empire\" (, tr. ; ), or \"Romania\" (), and to themselves as \"Romans\". \n\nSeveral signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324\u2013337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379\u2013395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin.

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition and heat-related health problems. \n\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions. \n\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030. \n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was \"a methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed .\" \n\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty. \n\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases.

When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \"I didn't think it was a big deal,\" Wang says. \"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,\" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. \"If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,\" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. \"If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,\" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. \"I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,\" he says. \"I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What decision did Sun Yukun make?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Was that a good decision for him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is this an issue for many students?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is it difficult to maintain previous residential status after if you want to move home?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What should the decision be based on?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is it optional?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who posted a guideline for transferring?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What saves a lot of trouble?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "According to who?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What does he recommend for those that have family with assets?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does it result in loss of benefits?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who is Ju Haojie?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Does is effect medical insurance benefits?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What do some students abandon for prospects of a better life?", "turn_id": 16}], "answers": [{"span_start": 154, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one", "input_text": "he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 322, "span_end": 432, "span_text": " Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record).

Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect. The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen, depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens: \n\nOne way of proving that a given disease is \"infectious\", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (first proposed by Robert Koch), which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls, and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis. Koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture. Often, even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria. For example, Treponema pallidum, the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes.

With no end in sight, Jewish refugee agencies requested the British government to allow them to bring in only Jewish children under17 years of age. This was to be only temporary, until the situation in their home countries was improved. \n\nKindertransport, meaning \"children transport\" in German, was then born. Children from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and other Nazi-occupied regions were transported to the United Kingdom. There they were either placed with other families or in hostels. Later, it was found that many of these children were the only survivors of their families. Nicholas Winton was among those people who helped to save Jewish children. He managed to rescue 669 children from Czechoslovakia and bring them safely to England. In 1938 around Christmas, 29-year-old Nicky was about to leave for a skiing holiday. Suddenly, Martin Blake, one of his good friends, contacted him from Czechoslovakia, asking him to travel there to help political refugees on the run from the Nazis. And Nicholas agreed. \n\nNicky spent his entire holiday of 3 weeks in the capital city of Prague where he saw the situation first-hand. Once back in England, he immediately started organizing the evacuation of children from the Czech region. From advertising for the necessary permits, Nicky worked tirelessly.

She owned and published The Washington Post. Under her leadership, it became one of the most important newspapers in the country. Katharine Meyer was born in New York City in 1917. Her father was a successful investment banker and became an important financial official. Her family was very rich. Katharine grew up in large houses in New York and Washington. Her parents were often away from home, traveling and working, Katharine was often lonely. Katherine Meyer graduated from the University of Chicago in Illinois in 1938. In 1933, her father bought a failing newspaper, The Washington Post. It was the least successful one of five newspapers in Washington. Katharine Graham returned to Washington and got a job editing letters to the editor of her father's newspaper. She married Philip Graham. He was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter but soon accepted a job at his wife's father's newspaper. Mr. Graham improved The Washington Post. He bought Newsweek and several television stations. He also established close ties with important political leaders. However, Mr. Graham treated his wife badly. He had an affair with a young reporter. For many years, Mr. Graham suffered from mental illness. He killed himself in 1963. Katharine Graham had four children to raise and a newspaper to operate. At first, she was only concerned about finding a way to keep control of The Washington Post until her sons were old enough. She did not think she had the ability to do an important job. She had no training in business or experience in operating a large company. In those days, it was unusual for a woman to be the head of a business. Women were expected to look after their homes and children. Katharine Graham met with officials of The Washington Post. She was elected president of The Washington Post Company. She had no idea about how to operate a newspaper. So she decided to learn. She began by hiring Benjamin C.Bradlee. He later became chief editor. Mr. Bradlee improved the newspaper. He hired excellent reporters and editors. They began doing important investigative reporting. In 1969, Mrs. Graham became publisher as well as president of The Washington Post Company.

Fond of Samoa and the Samoans, he thought to bring peace and enjoy popularity among the islanders; of a genial, amiable, and sanguine temper, he made no doubt but he could repair the breach with the English consul. Hope told a flattering tale. He awoke to find himself exchanging defiances with de Coetlogon, beaten in the field by Mataafa, surrounded on the spot by general exasperation, and disowned from home by his own government. The history of his administration leaves on the mind of the student a sentiment of pity scarcely mingled. \n\nOn Blacklock he did not call, and, in view of Leary's attitude, may be excused. But the English consul was in a different category. England, weary of the name of Samoa, and desirous only to see peace established, was prepared to wink hard during the process and to welcome the result of any German settlement. It was an unpardonable fault in Becker to have kicked and buffeted his ready-made allies into a state of jealousy, anger, and suspicion. Knappe set himself at once to efface these impressions, and the English officials rejoiced for the moment in the change. Between Knappe and de Coetlogon there seems to have been mutual sympathy; and, in considering the steps by which they were led at last into an attitude of mutual defiance, it must be remembered that both the men were sick,--Knappe from time to time prostrated with that formidable complaint, New Guinea fever, and de Coetlogon throughout his whole stay in the islands continually ailing.

He had, in the interval, endeavoured to make himself familiar with the country. Forts had been erected all round Cairo on heights dominating the town, so that a comparatively small force could overawe the population. He himself paid two visits to Suez. Desaix had pushed the Mamelukes still farther into Upper Egypt; a division had established the French authority at Damietta and Rosetta, and every arrangement was made by which the main body of the army could move away with a fair hope that Egypt would remain quiet during its absence. \n\nIt was now the beginning of December. During the journey down to the coast Edgar had thought seriously of his position. It seemed to him that, although finally the French would have to evacuate Egypt, a long time might elapse before this took place, and he finally came to the resolution to attempt to escape. He was doing neither himself nor his father any good by remaining. He had already witnessed a great battle by land, and one by sea, and he thought, by returning home and rejoining his father, he would be better employed in acquiring commercial knowledge in a business in London than in remaining in Egypt.

There are a few things. Many other magical stories take place in faraway lands or in past or future times. But Harry lives in modern England. He's also a very normal boy: polite, friendly, brave and clever. So when other children read about Harry, they can imagine being like him. J.K.

Graveling was there, with sullen, evil face. He made no attempt to shake hands with Maraton, and he sat at the table provided for them with folded arms and dour, uncompromising aspect. Dale came late and he, too, greeted Maraton with bluff unfriendliness. Borden's attitude was non-committal. Weavel shook hands, but his frown and manner were portentous. Culvain, the diplomat of the party, was quiet and reserved. David Ross alone had never lost his attitude of unwavering fidelity. He sat at Maraton's left hand, his head a little drooped, his eyes almost hidden beneath his shaggy grey eyebrows, his lower lip protuberant. He had, somehow, the air of a guarding dog, ready to spring into bitter words if his master were touched. \n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Maraton began, when at last they were all assembled, \"I have asked you, the committee who were appointed to meet me on my arrival England, to meet me once more here on the eve of the reopening of Parliament.\" \n\nThere was a grim silence.

It flashed upon him at once that he had used this in the sale last night, and so, of course, given his customer short weight. Many people would not have been much worried by this discovery.

The place was full of Spidey images. His struggling mother put everything she had into the party. \n\nUpon hearing the tale at his home in California, Lee decided to pitch in. \n\n\"After hearing of the boy's situation, how could I not?\" he told CNN. \n\nLee decided to draw a sketch of Spider-Man for Hunter.

THOMAS HUTCHINSON. \n\nNOW THAT Grandfather had fought through the old French War, in which our chair made no very distinguished figure, he thought it high time to tell the children some of the more private history of that praiseworthy old piece of furniture. \n\n\"In 1757,\" said Grandfather, \"after Shirley had been summoned to England, Thomas Pownall was appointed governor of Massachusetts. He was a gay and fashionable English gentleman, who had spent much of his life in London, but had a considerable acquaintance with America. The new governor appears to have taken no active part in the war that was going on; although, at one period, he talked of marching against the enemy at the head of his company of cadets. But, on the whole, he probably concluded that it was more befitting a governor to remain quietly in our chair, reading the newspapers and official documents.\" \n\n\"Did the people like Pownall?\" asked Charley. \n\n\"They found no fault with him,\" replied Grandfather. \"It was no time to quarrel with the governor when the utmost harmony was required in order to defend the country against the French. But Pownall did not remain long in Massachusetts. In 1759 he was sent to be governor of South Carolina. In thus exchanging one government for another, I suppose he felt no regret, except at the necessity of leaving Grandfather's chair behind him.\" \n\n\"He might have taken it to South Carolina,\" observed Clara. \n\n\"It appears to me,\" said Laurence, giving the rein to his fancy, \"that the fate of this ancient chair was, somehow or other, mysteriously connected with the fortunes of old Massachusetts.

The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve. \n\nAffirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required.

It is the largest population of Latino Americans and Hispanics outside of Latin America. More generally, it includes all persons in the United States who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, whether of full or partial ancestry. For the 2010 United States Census, people counted as \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" were those who identified as one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the census questionnaire (\"Mexican,\" \"Puerto Rican,\" or \"Cuban\") as well as those who indicated that they were \"other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.\" The national origins classified as Hispanic or Latino by the United States Census Bureau are the following: Spanish, Argentine, Cuban, Colombian, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Dominican, Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Bolivian, Chilean, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Uruguayan, and Venezuelan. Other U.S. government agencies have slightly different definitions of the term, including Brazilians and other Portuguese-speaking groups. The Census Bureau uses the terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably. \n\n\"Origin\" can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino may be of any race.

Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \"photograph\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 (\"phos\"), meaning \"light\", and \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae (\"graph\u00ea\"), meaning \"drawing, writing\", together meaning \"drawing with light\". \n\nThe first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822 using the bitumen-based \"heliography\" process developed by Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce. The first photographs of a real-world scene, made using a camera obscura, followed a few years later, but Ni\u00e9pce's process was not sensitive enough to be practical for that application: a camera exposure lasting for hours or days was required. In 1829 Ni\u00e9pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre and the two collaborated to work out a similar but more sensitive and otherwise improved process. \n\nAfter Ni\u00e9pce's death in 1833, Daguerre concentrated on silver halide-based alternatives. He exposed a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor, creating a layer of light-sensitive silver iodide; exposed it in the camera for a few minutes; developed the resulting invisible latent image to visibility with mercury fumes; then bathed the plate in a hot salt solution to remove the remaining silver iodide, making the results light-fast. He named this first practical process for making photographs with a camera the daguerreotype, after himself. Its existence was announced to the world on 7 January 1839 but working details were not made public until 19 August. Other inventors soon made improvements which reduced the required exposure time from a few minutes to a few seconds, making portrait photography truly practical and widely popular.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is a photo", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "how are they created", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what year was the word photograph coined", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what was made in 1822", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what happened in 1829", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who died in 1833", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "how do you create a light sensitive silver iodide", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "is photograpy practical and popular", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how are most created", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "who died in 1833", "turn_id": 10, "bad_turn": "true"}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface", "input_text": "an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface", "input_text": "by light falling on a light-sensitive surface", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 447, "span_text": "The word \"photograph\" was coined in 1839", "input_text": "1839", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 617, "span_end": 705, "span_text": "The first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822", "input_text": "The first permanent photograph", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1027, "span_end": 1186, "span_text": "In 1829 Ni\u00e9pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre and the two collaborated to work out a similar but more sensitive and otherwise improved process.", "input_text": "In 1829 Ni\u00e9pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1189, "span_end": 1217, "span_text": "After Ni\u00e9pce's death in 1833", "input_text": "Ni\u00e9pce", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1281, "span_end": 1333, "span_text": "exposed a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor", "input_text": "exposing a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1975, "span_end": 2032, "span_text": " portrait photography truly practical and widely popular.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 169, "span_end": 212, "span_text": "Most photographs are created using a camera", "input_text": "sing a camera", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1194, "span_end": 1200, "span_text": " Ni\u00e9pc", "input_text": "Ni\u00e9pce", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Photograph.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3efe17qcrc58hvsa5uko5oai21nhs8", "filename": "cnn_506cb3daf53b43124e5b57bb841c45f769b8fc17.story", "story": "The latest chapter in Amanda Knox's long legal battle began Monday in Florence, Italy, with a retrial over the 2007 killing of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. \n\nBut Knox, 26, who has expressed concern about returning to a country where she spent four years behind bars, was not in court. \n\nNeither was Kercher's family, which said in a statement submitted by their lawyer in court on Monday that they would be following the new trial closely from the United Kingdom. \n\nKnox was convicted in 2009 of murdering Kercher, a 21-year old British exchange student who was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa the two young women rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. \n\nFamily: Amanda Knox won't return to Italy for new trial \n\nThe convictions of Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were overturned in 2011 for \"lack of evidence.\" \n\nAfter her acquittal, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle, where she has been living since. \n\nKnox: Sometimes, I can't stop crying \n\nBut Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying the jury that acquitted Knox didn't consider all the evidence, and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. \n\nThe retrial's opening day Monday was dominated by procedural items.

He knows from experience what it means, as the Portuguese film director has reached the age of 102 and is still active in his profession. Every year, Oliveira shoots a film and is currently working on his next project. \"You have to work, work, work in order to forget that death is not far away,\" he said. When asked about his age, Oliveira said with some humility: \"It's down to mother nature. It gave to me what it took from others.\" \n\nBeing both mentally and physically fit in old age is partly a matter of luck, but it also has something to do with character. Not every white-haired person is wise and social skills, openness and the ability to train the brain are essential for senior citizens. \n\nAlong with the architect Oscar Niemeyer (103), Nobel laureate Montalcini (101) and director Kurt Maetzig (100), Oliveira is one of those people of whom it would be very wrong to think as members of a listless elderly generation. \n\nAnother master in his profession is the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The 103-year-old Brazilian is best known for his futuristic-looking buildings in Brasilia, but he also speaks out on behalf of the poor. \"The role of the architect is to struggle for a better world where we can develop a form of architecture that serves everyone and not just a privileged few,\" said Niemeyer recently. He spends almost every day working in his office in Copacabana, and even when he falls ill he keeps working on ideas: After a gallbladder operation he composed a samba tune in the clinic. \n\nAnother man who could sing a song about age is 107-year-old Heesters. The Dutch-born opera singer spent most of his life performing in Germany, where he still works. Recently Heesters said: \"I want to be at least 108-years-old.\" He also plans to keep performing. \" _ \" Heesters has not given up trying to add to his tally of awards and is looking for a \"good stage role\". \n\nItalian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini, who is 101-year-old and is still active in medical science, has described the force that keeps driving her on: \"Progress is created through imperfection.\" In 1986 she and her lab colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work on nerve growth factor.

Kenneth Biros, 51, was put to death in December. It was Ohio's first execution since September, when Gov. Ted Strickland and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for Broom's lethal injections. \n\nThe one-drug method used on Biros had never been tried on U.S. death row inmates. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said.

Professor Nigel Wilson, of the civil and environmental engineering department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he was \"supportive to the limiting of private cars during the Olympic Games\", saying that in foreign countries, the method is also adopted during big events, but he was unsure about the approach. The government planned to keep an average of more than one million cars off the roads to improve traffic flow during the Olympics, said Liu Xiaoming, deputy director of the Beijing Traffic Committee, at the China Planning Network First Urban Transportation Congress. Sharing Wilson's view, Dr. Yoshitsugu Hayashi, dean of the Graduate School of Environmental Studies of Nagoya University, believed the reduction in car use should be achieved not by banning, but through _ . \"Drivers who don't use their private cars could be given points,\" he said, \"and the points could be exchanged for goods from online shopping.\" Wetzel stressed limiting the use of company cars. \"Governmental officials should also be encouraged to use public transportation or ride bicycles,\" he said, adding that he himself is a bicycle-rider in London. Matthew Martimo, director of Traffic Engineering with Citilabs, said the bicycle was China's advantage. \"Limiting private cars is an idea worth trying but it is just a temporary solution,\" he said. \"The real cause of congestion is high density of people in Beijing and many have cars.\" Beijing, with a population of 15 million, is home to more than three million automobiles, and the number is rising by 1,000 a day. Professor Wilson said the Olympic Games was a great opportunity for Beijing to think about traffic problems and develop transportation, adding that the city had already been making public transport more efficient. Beijing has promised to stretch its 114-kilometer city railway to 200 kilometers before the opening of the Olympic Games. \"We are looking forward to borrowing Beijing's experiences and drawing from

He has enabled countless mothers to give birth to healthy babies, including his own daughter, Tracey, who had a healthy son thanks to her father's blood. \n\nMr. Harrison has been giving blood every few weeks since he was 18 years old and has now racked up a total of 984 donations. When he started donating, his blood was deemed so special that his life was insured for one million Australian dollars. \n\nHe was also nicknamed the \"man with the golden arm\" or the \"man in _ \". He said, \"I've never thought about stopping. Never!\" He made a pledge to be a donor aged 14 after undergoing major chest surgery in which he needed 13 liters of blood. \"I was in hospital for three months,\" he said. \"The blood I received saved my life so I made a pledge to give blood when I was 18.\" \n\nJust after he started donating he was found to have the rare and life-saving antibody in his blood. At the time, thousands of babies in Australia were dying each year of Rhesus disease. Other newborns suffered permanent brain damage because of the condition. _ . It stems from one having Rh-positive blood and the other Rh-negative . \n\nHis blood has since led to the development of a vaccine called Anti-D. After his blood type was discovered, Mr. Harrison volunteered to undergo a series of tests to help develop the Anti-D vaccine. \"They insured me for a million dollars so I knew my wife Barbara would be taken care of,\" he said. \"I wasn't scared. I was glad to help. I had to sign every form going and basically sign my life away.\" \n\nMr. Harrison is Rh-negative and was given injections of Rh-positive blood.

In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.[citation needed] One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the Australian Democrats, founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister Don Chipp and members of minor liberal parties; other members of the left-leaning section of the middle-class became Labor supporters.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Liberals have done increasingly well in recent years among socially conservative working-class voters.[citation needed]However the Liberal Party's key support base remains the upper-middle classes; 16 of the 20 richest federal electorates are held by the Liberals, most of which are safe seats.

He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran formed the basis of Islamic religious belief. \n\nBorn approximately 570CE (Year of the Elephant) in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at an early age; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib. Periodically, he would seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer; later, at age 40, he reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave, where he stated he received his first revelation from God. Three years later, in 610, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that \"God is One\", that complete \"surrender\" (lit. \"isl\u0101m\") to him is the right course of action (\"d\u012bn\"), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Around when was he born?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And died?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did he unite?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where was he born?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which animal was the symbol for the year he was born?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does Islam literally mean?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Was he cared for by his grandfather?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is he seen as a prophet?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many other prophets are mentioned?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What religion did he start?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where would he hide himself?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What was its name?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why did he go there?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who was he visited by there?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What happened next?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "From whom?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How old was he when that happened?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 8, "span_text": "Muhammad", "input_text": "Muhammad", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 17, "span_end": 23, "span_text": "570 CE", "input_text": "570 CE", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 33, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "632 CE", "input_text": "632 CE", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 410, "span_end": 416, "span_text": "Arabia", "input_text": "Arabia", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 621, "span_end": 626, "span_text": "Mecca", "input_text": "Mecca", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 588, "span_end": 596, "span_text": "Elephant", "input_text": "Elephant", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1083, "span_end": 1092, "span_text": "surrender", "input_text": "surrender", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 703, "span_end": 727, "span_text": "paternal uncle Abu Talib", "input_text": "no, by paternal uncle Abu Talib", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 637, "span_end": 649, "span_text": "was orphaned", "input_text": "was orphaned", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1167, "span_end": 1180, "span_text": "was a prophet", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 210, "span_end": 237, "span_text": "Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 70, "span_end": 76, "span_text": " Islam", "input_text": "Islam", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 773, "span_end": 786, "span_text": "mountain cave", "input_text": "mountain cave", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 793, "span_end": 797, "span_text": "Hira", "input_text": "Hira", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 820, "span_end": 826, "span_text": "prayer", "input_text": "prayer", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 802, "span_end": 816, "span_text": "several nights", "input_text": "several nights", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 875, "span_end": 882, "span_text": "Gabriel", "input_text": "Gabriel", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 915, "span_end": 944, "span_text": "received his first revelation", "input_text": "received his first revelation", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 945, "span_end": 953, "span_text": "from God", "input_text": "from God", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 842, "span_end": 844, "span_text": "40", "input_text": "40", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Muhammad.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "308xblvesi4mp3pbqdant32oltwrbp", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Wilkie Collins___I Say No.txt/CHAPTER XXIX_28beef8674df2e3693713a8cb20ff8de8dba9a5b5a41e8b2d0cf1bf", "story": "CHAPTER XXIX. \"BONY.\" \n\nMrs. Ellmother reluctantly entered the room. \n\nSince Emily had seen her last, her personal appearance doubly justified the nickname by which her late mistress had distinguished her.
