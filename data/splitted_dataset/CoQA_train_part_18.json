His contributions have been acknowledged and lauded, repeatedly, with honorary degrees and awards that include the National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Marconi Prize and membership in the National Academy of Engineering. \n\nIn the early days, Cerf was a manager for the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funding various groups to develop TCP/IP technology. When the Internet began to transition to a commercial opportunity during the late 1980s, Cerf moved to MCI where he was instrumental in the development of the first commercial email system (MCI Mail) connected to the Internet. \n\nCerf was instrumental in the funding and formation of ICANN from the start. He waited a year before stepping forward to join the ICANN Board, and eventually became chairman.

Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.

It rose very steeply from the water's edge, but the slope was uniform, and as a good deal of it consisted apparently of lightly-covered rock and gravel the pines were thinner, and there was less undergrowth than usual. Far above him the smooth ascent broke off abruptly, and, though he could not see beyond the edge, there certainly appeared to be a plateau between it and the farther wall of rock and snow. \n\n\"I think one could get up so far without very much trouble, sir,\" he said. \n\n\"That,\" replied Kinnaird, \"is how it strikes me.

There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name \"oak\" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably \"Lithocarpus\" (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as \"Grevillea robusta\" (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus \"Quercus\" is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species. \n\nOaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaf with smooth margins. Also, the acorns contain tannic acid, as do the leaves, which helps to guard from fungi and insects. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers. The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6\u201318 months to mature, depending on their species.

McDonald's primarily sells hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and after facing criticism for the unhealthy nature of their food, the company has expanded its menu to include salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. A McDonald's restaurant is operated by either a franchisee, an affiliate, or the corporation itself. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants.

A group of governors, educators, and CEOs weighed in on the best way universities can prepare for the future. They debated how the U.S. can take the responsibility for research while still preparing students for real jobs. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin said that the first thing she thinks about as governor is educating Oklahoma students and strengthening the workforce. So she's carrying out a program called \"America Works: Education and Training for Tomorrow's Jobs\" that aims to \"reorganize our education system with the current needs of our employers\". The state governor added that this new educational approach doesn't just benefit students and companies, but also improves the state economy. \"We've been able to attract new companies to our state because of what we're doing with our universities, because our students are a pipeline for the workforce,\" she said. \"General Electric Company (one of the world's biggest companies) is coming to Oklahoma.\" Other group members were more focused on the long-term goals of a research university. Amy Gutmann pointed out that \"basic research is the foundation for everything else that happens at a university. And if we don't do it, nobody else will.\" \"And if nobody does that research, we'll pay the price in health care bills,\" argued Vagelos, who is a former CEO of Merck & Co., Inc, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. \"The jobs of universities are basic research, which is what is needed for attacks on disease,\" he said. \"There has been a reduction in coronary heart disease by 60% in the last forty years because of this research, and that reduces health care costs.\" James Hunt, former North Carolina governor, argued for a happy medium. Effective communication, he said, would help the public see that the research conducted at universities actually serves a practical purpose.

The series takes place in a fictional universe, the same as Toriyama's previous series \"Dr. Slump\", and follows the adventures of Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls that are used to summon a wish-granting dragon. During the course of the story, he encounters allies such as Bulma, Kuririn, and Trunks, rivals such as Tenshinhan, Piccolo, and Vegeta, and enemies such as Freeza, Cell, and Majin Boo. The manga's anime and film adaptations feature some original characters not created by Toriyama but by the animation staff. \n\nWhile many of the characters are humans with superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals and extraterrestrial lifeforms. The series also includes depictions of the afterlife, where several characters are gods that govern the universe, and parallel universes as well. \n\nAkira Toriyama initially based most of the characters on those of the Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\", Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, and redeveloped one of his earlier one-shot manga series, \"Dragon Boy\". To be creative with the character, Toriyama stated in 1995 that he designed Goku not as a monkey like the \"Journey to the West\" character, but as a human-looking boy with a monkey's tail to give him a distinguishing feature. However, in 2003 he elaborated saying he added the tail because his editor told him without it Goku had no distinguishing features, even though this was probably a joke, he went ahead and did it. Toriyama later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on, and that he never thought of making Goku an alien until Vegeta appeared.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Does the series have aliens?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How about human-like animals?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is it called?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who made it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is it non-fiction?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does it connect to another of the author's creations?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Which one?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who is the main protagonist?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What other famous protagonist is he made after?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What book is he from?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What animal do they both relate to?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 858, "span_end": 917, "span_text": "s anthropomorphic animals and extraterrestrial lifeforms.

The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. \n\nThe word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root \u062f-\u0631-\u0633 D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) \u0645\u0641\u0639\u0644(\u0629)\u200e; maf\u02bbal(ah), meaning \"a place where something is done\". Therefore, madrasah literally means \"a place where learning and studying take place\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as dani\u015fmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 (j\u0101mi\u02bbah).

They even send birthday presents. Big Ben is not a person. It's a clock. Big Ben is the great clock hanging up in a tower of the parliament building. The people of London like to see Big Ben's four friendly faces. They like to hear the bell striking on the hour. Bong! Bong! Bong! Big Ben's story started in 1834. In that year the old parliament building was burned down. Its clock tower fell to the ground. There had to be a new building and a new clock. Plans were made. They called for a \"King of Clock, the biggest and the best in the world\". So the clock had to be big. And it had to keep very good time. In two years the big clock was made. Five more years went by before the clock tower was last finished. Then the four bells for the chimes were brought into the tower. And at last the big hour bell was put in place. It rang out for the first time on July 11, 1859. This great bell had to have a name. A meeting of parliament was called to pick one. \"This clock is the king of clocks,\" one man said. \"Let's call the bell the Queen of Bells.\" \"Then why not Victoria?\" said another (Victoria was the British queen at that time).

Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu province and Shanghai municipality to the north, Anhui province to the northwest, Jiangxi province to the west, and Fujian province to the south; to the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. \n\nThe province's name derives from the Zhe River (\u6d59\u6c5f, Zh\u00e8 Ji\u0101ng), the former name of the Qiantang River which flows past Hangzhou and whose mouth forms Hangzhou Bay. It is usually glossed as meaning \"Crooked\" or \"Bent River\", from the meaning of Chinese \u6298, but is more likely a phono-semantic compound formed from adding \u6c35 (the \"water\" radical used for river names) to phonetic \u6298 (pinyin zh\u00e9 but reconstructed Old Chinese *tet), preserving a proto-Wu name of the local Yue, similar to Yuhang, Kuaiji, and Jiang. \n\nZhejiang was the site of the Neolithic cultures of the Hemudu and Liangzhu.

It tells a story about four girls who come from different backgrounds and of different personalities. Since it was shown on June 27, Tiny Times has made 483 million yuan at the box office. The sequel of it was shown on Aug 8 and it has also been a big box office hit. Cao Yuhan, 13, a high school student at Beijing Jianhua Experimental School, is a big fan of the movie. \"I'm deeply touched by their friendship,\" Cao said. \"When Nan Xiwang is in trouble, the other three girls try their best to help her, even running barefoot in the snow. However, not everyone has had good things to say. The people's Daily said that the film went too far in encouraging youths to become materialistic . Film commentator Raymond Zhou wrote on his online blog that \"Buying luxury goods seems as a way to express love or friendship, and the word 'money' is repeated over and over again. Song Kexin, 14, a high school student at Zhida Middle School in Taiyuan, Shanxi, shows a typical example of a fan's attitude . And that's to look for the positive value. \"That movie is a little far from our daily life.

'Well, my girl,' said Michel, as he patted Marie's shoulder, and kissed her forehead, 'you've been up getting a rare breakfast for these fellows, I see.' Marie smiled, and made some good-humoured reply. No one could have told by her face that there was anything amiss with her. 'It's the last favour of the kind he'll ever have at your hands,' continued Michel, 'and yet he doesn't seem to be half grateful.' George stood with his back to the kitchen fire, and did not say a word. It was impossible for him even to appear to be pleasant when such things were being said. Marie was a better hypocrite, and, though she said little, was able to look as though she could sympathise with her uncle's pleasant mirth. The two men had soon eaten their breakfast and were gone, and then Marie was left alone with her thoughts.

came up with a brilliant plan.I worked out a way for Rich to meet my mother and win her over.In fact,I arranged it so my mother would want to cook a meal especially for him. \n\nRich was not only not Chinese and he was a few years younger than I was.And unfortunately,he looked much younger with his curly red hair,smooth pale skin,and the splash of orange freckles across his nose.He was a bit on the short side,compactly built.In his dark business suits,he looked nice but easily forgettable,which was why I didn't notice him the first year we worked together at the firm.But my mother noticed everything. \n\n\"So what do you think of Rich?\"I finally asked,holding my breath. \n\nShe tossed the eggplant in the hot oil,angry hissing sound.\"So many spots on his face,\"she said. \n\n\"They are freckles.Freckles are good luck.\"I said a bit too heatedly in trying to raise my voice above the noise of the kitchen. \n\n\"Oh?\"She said innocently. \n\n\"Yes,the more spots the better.\" \n\nShe considered this a moment and then smiled and spoke in Chinese:\"When you were young,you got the chicken pox.So many spots,you had to stay home for ten days.So lucky,you thought.\" \n\nI couldn't save Rich in the kitchen.And I couldn't save him later at the dinner table. \n\nWhen I offered Rich a fork,he insisted on using the slippery ivory chopsticks.Halfway between his plate and his open mouth,a large chunk of redcooked eggplant fell on his brand new white shirt. \n\nAnd then he helped himself to big portions of the shrimp and snow peas,not realizing he should have taken only a polite spoonful. \n\nHe declined the new greens,the tender and expensive leaves of bean plants.He thought he was being polite by refusing seconds,when he should have followed my father's example,who made a big show of taking small portions of seconds,thirds and even fourths,always saying he couldn't resist another bite and then groaning he was so full he thought he would burst. \n\nBut the worst was when Rich criticized my mother's cooking and he didn't even know what he had done.As is the Chinese cook's custom,my mother always made modest remarks about her own cooking.That night she chose to

A computer requires programs to function and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. \n\nA computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine code\u2014a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter. \n\nA part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm. A collection of computer programs, libraries, and related data are referred to as software. Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as application software or system software. \n\nThe earliest programmable machines preceded the invention of the digital computer. In 1801, Joseph-Marie Jacquard devised a loom that would weave a pattern by following a series of perforated cards. Patterns could be woven and repeated by arranging the cards. \n\nIn 1837, Charles Babbage was inspired by Jacquard's loom to attempt to build the Analytical Engine. The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled.

The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \"green village\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. \n\nThe name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Henry VIII lived there. He knew that England must be strong at sea. So he started two big ship-yards at Greenwich. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. \n\nAt this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea: their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were. You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich Time.", "questions": [{"input_text": "how far from London is Greenwich?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Does it have a meaning?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "who built the ports?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "did he have a house there?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "named what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "where is the clock now?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "when did the war start?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "how old is Greenwhich's history?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "who made the telescope?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "why did he make it?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who made the clock?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what happened to everything in Placentia?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "who appointed Flamsteed?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did King Charles make a new house?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "where did Flamsteed work?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "for how long?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Did the clock help?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who did it help?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "how?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 28, "span_end": 63, "span_text": "ive miles from the middle of London", "input_text": "five miles", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 191, "span_end": 214, "span_text": "meaning \"green village\"", "input_text": "meaning \"green village\"", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 346, "span_end": 356, "span_text": "Henry VIII", "input_text": "Henry VIII", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 346, "span_end": 368, "span_text": "Henry VIII lived there", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 335, "span_end": 344, "span_text": "Placentia", "input_text": "Placentia", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1527, "span_end": 1558, "span_text": "n Greenwich's museum of the sea", "input_text": "n Greenwich's museum of the sea", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 498, "span_end": 520, "span_text": "In 1649, a war started", "input_text": "In 1649", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 69, "span_end": 106, "span_text": "its history is two thousand years old", "input_text": "two thousand years old", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1096, "span_end": 1194, "span_text": "Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park.

A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.

The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black. \n\nScottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments.

Recent archaeological excavations near the Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating from 2100 BC.[citation needed] The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural period, circa 1200 BC to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting. The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.[citation needed]", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is the second largest city in Arizona by population?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is its nickname?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "how many companies manufacture or design optics there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what county is Tucson in?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "what are the Hohokam known for?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "do they also make pottery?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what kind of crops did early agricultural people grow?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "where is the university of arizona?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how far is it from Phoenix?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "how close is it to Mexico?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "who visited Tucson first?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what is the 2010 population estimated to be?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "how far back is the date of the village that archaeologists found?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 450, "span_end": 505, "span_text": " Tucson is the second-largest populated city in Arizona", "input_text": "Tucson", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 912, "span_end": 925, "span_text": "Optics Valley", "input_text": "Optics Valley", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 781, "span_end": 844, "span_text": "150 Tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture", "input_text": "150", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 39, "span_end": 74, "span_text": "and the county seat of Pima County,", "input_text": "Pima County,", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1614, "span_end": 1663, "span_text": "are known for their vast irrigation canal systems", "input_text": "vast irrigation canal systems", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1667, "span_end": 1712, "span_text": " their red-on-brown pottery.[citation needed]", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1341, "span_end": 1358, "span_text": " grew corn, beans", "input_text": "corn and beans", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 136, "span_text": "Tucson (/\u02c8tu\u02d0s\u0252n/ /tu\u02d0\u02c8s\u0252n/) is a city and the county seat of Pima County, Arizona, United States, and home to the University of Arizona", "input_text": "Tucson", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 569, "span_end": 628, "span_text": "The city is located 108 miles (174 km) southeast of Phoenix", "input_text": "108 miles (174 km) southeast of Phoenix", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 633, "span_end": 679, "span_text": "60 mi (97 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border.", "input_text": "60 mi (97 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 929, "span_end": 980, "span_text": "Tucson was probably first visited by Paleo-Indians,", "input_text": "Paleo-Indians,", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 137, "span_end": 197, "span_text": " The 2010 United States Census put the population at 520,116", "input_text": "520,116", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1087, "span_end": 1151, "span_text": "Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating from 2100 BC", "input_text": "2100 BC", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "Tucson,_ArizonaTucson,_Arizona_facecb1fc98757f6209df025612b9dcb7fe8e9c72dcf77208e55b650"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3r3yrb5grf39mlc0ot5w335293aaux", "filename": "mc160.train.13", "story": "Flying a kite can be dangerous.

If so, you may want to play some basketball in between hitting the books. Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels , including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says, \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can really cause physical changes in the brain.\" \n\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret. \n\nOlder people can beef up their brains as well. Scientists from 11 universities studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants , exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions, such as with yoga or tai-chi, helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time. \n\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as three hours of exercise a week.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Can old farts beef up their brains?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who studied a group of seniors?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Were they all from the same university?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many difference schools were involved?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old were the greyhairs they studied?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What could short-term memory increase up to?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What did they seniors need to do?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How many hours?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Daily or weekly?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does the exercise have to be arduous?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What does it need to increase, though?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Should learning be simpler or more complex?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What's a new skill or motion that might help them?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What's another?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 664, "span_end": 672, "span_text": "changes ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1487, "span_end": 1498, "span_text": "Scientists ", "input_text": "Scientists", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1503, "span_end": 1506, "span_text": "11 ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1503, "span_end": 1506, "span_text": "11 ", "input_text": "11", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1566, "span_end": 1589, "span_text": "seventy to seventy-nine", "input_text": "seventy to seventy-nine", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1647, "span_end": 1658, "span_text": " 40 percent", "input_text": "40 percent", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1665, "span_end": 1675, "span_text": "exercising", "input_text": "exercise", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1681, "span_end": 1687, "span_text": "three ", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1695, "span_end": 1699, "span_text": "week", "input_text": "weekly", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1739, "span_end": 1748, "span_text": "difficult", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1783, "span_end": 1793, "span_text": "heart rate", "input_text": "heart rate", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1882, "span_end": 1892, "span_text": "complexity", "input_text": "More complex", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1944, "span_end": 1949, "span_text": "yoga ", "input_text": "yoga", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1952, "span_end": 1958, "span_text": "tai-ch", "input_text": "tai-chi", "turn_id": 14}], "name": "high20301.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3h7z272lx77dqzv84yvs2byevoylpr", "filename": "middle6094.txt", "story": "Mary is getting married next Saturday.Today she asks her best friend Lucy to shop for clothes to wear at the wedding.'So what are we looking for, Mary,' Lucy asks.

Scipio then returned home, and entered Rome with a grand triumph, all the nobler for himself that he did not lead Hannibal in his chains. He had been too generous to demand that so brave an enemy should be delivered up to him. He received the surname of Africanus, and was one of the most respected and beloved of Romans. He was the first who began to take up Greek learning and culture, and to exchange the old Roman ruggedness for the graces of philosophy and poetry. Indeed the Romans were beginning to have much to do with the Greeks, and the war they entered upon now was the first for the sake of spreading their own power. All the former ones had been in self-defence, and the new one did in fact spring out of the Punic war, for the Carthaginians had tried to persuade Philip, king of Macedon, to follow in the track of Pyrrhus, and come and help Hannibal in Southern Italy. The Romans had kept him off by stirring up the robber \u00c6tolians against him; and when he began to punish these wild neighbors, the Romans leagued themselves with the old Greek cities which Macedon oppressed, and a great war took place. \n\nTitus Quinctius Flaminius commanded in Greece for four years, first as consul and then as proconsul. His crowning victory was at Cynocephal\u00e6, or the Dogshead Rocks, where he so broke the strength of Macedon that at the Isthmian games he proclaimed the deliverance of Greece, and in their joy the people crowded round him with crowns and garlands, and shouted so loud that birds in the air were said to have dropped down at the sound.

As the two boys ran forward, the master of the _Stormy Petrel_ gave a lurch and landed on some old boxes with a crash. \n\n\"Oh, Dave, can this be possible!\" murmured Roger. \"I did not think the captain would do it.\" \n\n\"Let us help him to the ship,\" answered Dave. He was as much shocked as his companion, and he could not help but think of what the supercargo had said. \n\n\"Oh, is it you, boys?\" mumbled the captain, as he espied them. \"I want to--to get back to the ship.\" \n\n\"We'll help you,\" said Dave. \n\n\"I've had an awful night--my mind is in a perfect whirl,\" went on the master of the _Stormy Petrel_. \n\n\"We'll soon have you safe on the bark,\" put in Roger. \n\nThe two assisted the captain to his feet. His eyes had a peculiar stare in them. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his pocket.

Supporters say that the new approach, called reader's workshop, helps develop a love for reading in students who are bored by classic literature. They argue that the best way to motivate students to read more is to offer them more choices. \n\n_ , however. They worry that students who choose trendy, less challenging titles over the classics won't be exposed to the great writing and key themes of important works of literature.Student reporters Donald and Sarah express their ideas about this new approach. \n\nDonald thinks that we should turn the page. Students should be allowed to select the books they read in English class. He says he and his classmates are allowed to pick their own books in class. That makes them more focused, and they look forward to class time. Tristin, a classmate of his at Clinton Middle School agrees. \"I'm reading books that I want to read, which makes class more fun and interesting,\" he says. Offering students a choice may also improve test scores. Studies by Professor John Guthrie of the University of Maryland found that students in grades 4 through 6 who had some choices in the books they read showed improved reading comprehension skills during testing. Giving students the chance to decide what they read helps build a lifelong love for reading. Isn't that what we want for our students? \n\nSarah holds a different view. She thinks teachers know more about books than students do. When an English teacher assigns a book, he or she keeps in mind the reading level of most students in the class. Students who choose their own books might be cheating themselves by picking books that are not up to their reading level or that are too difficult. Furthermore, a whole class can discuss a book it reads together. That makes it easier for some kids to understand what they are reading. \"The students wouldn't be able to hold a meaningful conversation if they were all reading different books,\" says Kristin, an English teacher at Fleetwood Area Middle School. \"If they read the same book, their conversations would be more in-depth.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is a good way to get students to want to read?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is this approach called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what kind of books are no longer being used?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what is the concern with students choosing trendy titles?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does Donald think?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what does that mean?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "are him and his classmates able to?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is this expected to improve grades?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "which skills were improved?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does Sarah hold a different view?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what is it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "how might a student be cheating themselves?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "what makes it easier for them to understand?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "would that work if they are reading different books?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "what are Donald and Sarah's titles?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who is Tristin?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who is John Guthrie?", "turn_id": 17}], "answers": [{"span_start": 308, "span_end": 382, "span_text": "best way to motivate students to read more is to offer them more choices.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. \n\nWhile some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. \n\nThe deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60\u201385 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).

Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r. \n\nFollowing centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, West Slavs, Gepids and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin. His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting the country to a Christian kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century. Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541\u20131699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed the great power Austro\u2013Hungarian Empire together with Austria.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Is Hungary a republic?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What kind of republic?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How many people are there?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What country borders it to the north?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "To the northeast?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "To the west?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is the official language?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is it part of the European Union?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which city is the capital>", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Which city is the largest?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Name one of the other people that lived there?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Name another?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who was Arpad?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who was Stephen I?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When did he ascend to the throne?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "And then what did he do to the country?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When was Hungary's golden age?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When was the Battle of Mohacs?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Was there an Ottoman occupation?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 44, "span_text": "Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic ", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 20, "span_end": 43, "span_text": " parliamentary republic", "input_text": "Parliamentary.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 313, "span_end": 341, "span_text": "about 10 million inhabitants", "input_text": "About 10 million.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 139, "span_end": 148, "span_text": "Slovakia ", "input_text": "Slovakia.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 282, "span_end": 289, "span_text": "Ukraine", "input_text": "Ukraine.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 230, "span_end": 239, "span_text": "Slovenia ", "input_text": "Slovenia .", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 405, "span_end": 439, "span_text": "The official language is Hungarian", "input_text": "Hungarian.", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 343, "span_end": 403, "span_text": "Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 502, "span_end": 567, "span_text": " Hungary's capital and its largest city and metropolis is Budapes", "input_text": "Budapest.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 526, "span_end": 568, "span_text": "ts largest city and metropolis is Budapest", "input_text": "Budapest.", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 753, "span_end": 758, "span_text": "Celts", "input_text": "Celts.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 760, "span_end": 766, "span_text": "Romans", "input_text": "Romans.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 859, "span_end": 892, "span_text": " the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d", "input_text": "The Hungarian grand prince.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 934, "span_end": 962, "span_text": "His great-grandson Stephen I", "input_text": "His great-grandson.", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 986, "span_end": 990, "span_text": "1000", "input_text": "1000.", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 992, "span_end": 1037, "span_text": "converting the country to a Christian kingdom", "input_text": "Converted it to a Christian kingdom.", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1117, "span_end": 1157, "span_text": "eaching a golden age by the 15th century", "input_text": "The 15th century.", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1169, "span_end": 1197, "span_text": "the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526", "input_text": "1526.", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1208, "span_end": 1247, "span_text": "150 years of partial Ottoman occupation", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1249, "span_end": 1259, "span_text": "1541\u20131699)", "input_text": "1541\u20131699.", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "Hungary.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "34t446b1c0ehzexia0n3kr7jtgs0cl", "filename": "mc500.dev.39", "story": "The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along.

It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse\u2013chorus structure. \n\nAdult contemporary is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments (though bass guitar is usually used) such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched.

All the night was balmy with the faint and almost aromatic scent of ripening grain and drying grass. The stallion stamped again, and Dick, with a deep breath and realization that never had he more loved it all, looked up and circled the sky-line where the crests of the mountains blotted the field of stars. \n\n\"No, Cato,\" he mused aloud. \"One cannot agree with you. Man does not depart from life as from an inn. He departs as from a dwelling, the one dwelling he will ever know. He departs ... nowhere. It is good night. For him the Noiseless One ... and the dark.\" \n\nHe made as if to start, but once again the stamp of the stallions held him, and the hillside bell rang out. He drew a deep inhalation through his nostrils of the air of balm, and loved it, and loved the fair land of his devising. \n\n\"'I looked into time and saw none of me there,'\" he quoted, then capped it, smiling, with a second quotation: \"'She gat me nine great sons.... The other nine were daughters.'\" \n\nBack at the house, he did not immediately go in, but stood a space gazing at the far flung lines of it. Nor, inside, did he immediately go to his own quarters. Instead, he wandered through the silent rooms, across the patios, and along the dim-lit halls. His frame of mind was as of one about to depart on a journey. He pressed on the lights in Paula's fairy patio, and, sitting in an austere Roman seat of marble, smoked a cigarette quite through while he made his plans.

In this understanding, the \"Christian Church\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers; but most Christians follow the traditional Christian understanding of the term, and believe that the term \"Christian Church\" or \"Church\" applies only to a specific historic Christian body or institution, namely their own (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, the Non-Chalcedonian Churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, or the Assyrian Church of the East). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are that the Church is One (a unified Body of Particular Churches in full Communion of doctrines and faith with each other), Holy (a sanctified and deified Body), Catholic (Universal and containing the fullness of Truth in itself), and Apostolic (its hierarchy, doctrines, and faith can be traced back to the Apostles). \n\nThus, the majority of Christians globally (particularly of the apostolic churches listed above, as well as some Anglo-Catholics) consider the Christian Church as a visible and institutional \"societas perfecta\" enlivened with supernatural grace, while Protestants generally understand the Church to be an invisible reality not identifiable with any specific earthly institution, denomination, or network of affiliated churches. Others equate the Church with particular groups that share certain essential elements of doctrine and practice, though divided on other points of doctrine and government (such as the branch theory as taught by some Anglicans).", "questions": [{"input_text": "What do the majority of Christians consider the Christian Church?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What do others equate the church with?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who is the term Christian Church usually used by to refer to the whole group?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What do most Christians believe about the term \"Christian Church\"?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Can you name a couple of these churches?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Name two?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where were the Four Marks of the Church 1st expressed?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is the first one of these Marks?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Can you name another?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What can the Apostolic Mark hierarchy, doctrines and faith be traced back to?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who thinks the the church is an invisible reality?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1075, "span_end": 1312, "span_text": "the majority of Christians globally (particularly of the apostolic churches listed above, as well as some Anglo-Catholics) consider the Christian Church as a visible and institutional \"societas perfecta\" enlivened with supernatural grace", "input_text": "a visible and institutional \"societas perfecta\" enlivened with supernatural grace", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1320, "span_end": 1494, "span_text": "Protestants generally understand the Church to be an invisible reality not identifiable with any specific earthly institution, denomination, or network of affiliated churches", "input_text": "an invisible reality not identifiable with any specific earthly institution, denomination, or network of affiliated churches", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 104, "span_text": "The Christian Church is a term generally used by Protestants and some others to refer to the whole group", "input_text": "Protestants", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 320, "span_end": 518, "span_text": "most Christians follow the traditional Christian understanding of the term, and believe that the term \"Christian Church\" or \"Church\" applies only to a specific historic Christian body or institution", "input_text": "it applies only to a specific historic Christian body or institution", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 538, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "e.g., the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 544, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church", "input_text": "the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 711, "span_end": 746, "span_text": "first expressed in the Nicene Creed", "input_text": "in the Nicene Creed", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 756, "span_end": 773, "span_text": "the Church is One", "input_text": "the Church is One", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 872, "span_end": 876, "span_text": "Holy", "input_text": "the Church is Holy", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 998, "span_end": 1064, "span_text": "hierarchy, doctrines, and faith can be traced back to the Apostles", "input_text": "the Apostles", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1320, "span_end": 1390, "span_text": "Protestants generally understand the Church to be an invisible reality", "input_text": "Protestants", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Christian_Church.txt"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3ns0a6kxc48ribjdggweghvkahggzl", "filename": "cnn_23a99d883baab03fcbbfca6478cb32c93cdc1414.story", "story": "(CNN) -- As World Cup openers go, this was about as bad as it gets for Portugal. \n\nThumped 4-0 by Germany, one key defender sent off, another possibly out of the tournament with injury and its World Player of the Year looking decidedly unfit. \n\nReal Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't lacking in effort but was as powerless as those around him to prevent Portugal being steamrollered by Der Mannschaft in Salvador. \n\nIt started badly for Paulo Bento's men and got steadily worse as Germany maintained its record of scoring at least four goals in every opening World Cup match since 2002. \n\nLatest World Cup scores \n\nThey were 1-0 down after 10 minutes when Joao Pereira was adjudged to have hauled down Mario Gotze.

As of July 1, 2016, Madison's estimated population of 252,551 made it the second largest city in Wisconsin, after Milwaukee, and the 82nd largest in the United States. The city forms the core of the United States Census Bureau's Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Dane County and neighboring Iowa, Green, and Columbia counties. The Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area's 2010 population was 568,593. \n\nFounded in 1829 on an isthmus between Lake Monona and Lake Mendota, Madison was named the capital of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836 and became the capital of the state of Wisconsin when it was admitted to the Union in 1848. That same year, the University of Wisconsin was founded in Madison and the state government and university have become the city's two largest employers. The city is also known for its lakes, restaurants, and extensive network of parks and bike trails, with much of the park system designed by landscape architect John Nolen. \n\nSince the 1960s, Madison has been a center of political liberalism, influenced in part by the presence of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \n\nMadison's origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge James Duane Doty purchased over a thousand acres (4\u00a0km\u00b2) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. He purchased 1,261 acres for $1,500. When the Wisconsin Territory was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in Belmont, Wisconsin.

It has two satellite campuses in Scarborough and Mississauga. \n\nAcademically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell research, and was the site of the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1, and the development of the theory of NP-completeness.

Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including virology, mycology, parasitology, and bacteriology. \n\nEukaryotic microorganisms possess membrane-bound cell organelles and include fungi and protists, whereas prokaryotic organisms\u2014all of which are microorganisms\u2014are conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound organelles and include eubacteria and archaebacteria. Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy. However, less than 1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means. Microbiologists often rely on extraction or detection of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA sequences. \n\nViruses have been variably classified as organisms, as they have been considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules. Prions, never considered microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, and virologists took search\u2014discovering \"infectious proteins\". \n\nThe existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed, for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus Terentius Varro in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds, by Robert Hooke in 1666, but the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher was likely the first to see microbes, which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in 1676, using simple microscopes of his own design.

TITHONUS \n\n\n\nA youth came riding towards a palace gate, And from the palace came a child of sin And took him by the curls and led him in! Where sat a company with heated eyes. Tennyson, A VISION OF SIN \n\nIt was in the month of June that Berenger de Ribaumont first came in sight of Paris. His grandfather had himself begun by taking him to London and presenting him to Queen Elizabeth, from whom the lad's good mien procured him a most favourable reception. She willingly promised that on which Lord Walwyn's heart was set, namely, that his title and rank should be continued to his grandson; and an ample store of letter of recommendation to Sir Francis Walsingham, the Ambassador, and all others who could be of service in the French court, were to do their utmost to provide him with a favourable reception there. \n\nThen, with Mr. Adderley and four or five servants, he had crossed the Channel, and had gone first to Chateau Leurre, where he was rapturously welcomed by the old steward Osbert.

The uniforms had long sleeves, and the cheerleaders wore gloves and cloth helmets. \n\n\"From the early 1960s until 1967, I spent tons of time on my hair,\" she says, noting her mod hairdo in the picture is actually a wig. \"Wigs were big back then.

Alfano still spent a lot of time on her hair, but her peers began heavily criticizing all things materialistic, so the style became more casual.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. \n\nSatire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humour.

Evelyn was all he thought her, but romantic admiration and respect for her fine qualities were not love. The important thing was that she held his promise and he must make it good. \n\nThere was no other way. Carrie knew he loved her, but she had shown him his duty. If he drew back and broke with Evelyn, he would earn her contempt; Carrie was very staunch and put honor first. Anyhow, he was going to draw back; he had been a fool, but he could pay. The trouble was, Evelyn was clever and might find him out. His face went grim as he thought about it; the strain of pretending, the effort to be kind. For all that, the effort must be made, and perhaps by and by things would be easier. \n\nFor a week he was quiet and moody and tried to occupy himself at the dyke. The evenings were the worst, because it soon got dark and he must talk to Jake and Carrie and try to look calm. Then he was puzzled about other things. Evelyn had gone to London and had not written to him. A few days afterwards, Dick, too, went to town, and Mrs. Halliday did not know why he had gone. Jim thought this strange, but it was not important.

Ritchie was a real gentleman who purposely chose to live right across the street from 'the Gap', just because he wanted to continue saving lives. He would wake up every morning and look out of the window for anyone standing too close to the edge of the cliff. If he saw someone and thought they might jump, he would simply walk over with a smile and say, \"Is there something I could do to help you?\" That sounds very simple, but it worked - Ritchie tried to have a talk with these people and ended up inviting them back to his house for tea or breakfast. In 2006, Ritchie was given the Medal of the Order of Australia for all his saving lives. In 2010, he and his wife were named Woollahra Council's citizens of the year and in 2011, he was given the Local Hero Award for Australia by the National Australia Day Council. In a situation where most would turn a blind eye, Don has taken action. With such simple actions Don has saved a number of lives.

Small motors may be found in electric watches. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on. \n\nPerhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the Scottish monk Andrew Gordon in the 1740s. The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Amp\u00e8re's force law, was discovered later by Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed.

Tell us in the Sound Off box below. \n\nHowever, when all seemed set for a perfect career, Kaka suffered a serious, potentially paralyzing injury from a swimming pool accident in 2000. The then 18-year-old fractured a vertebra in his spine -- an injury that many thought could have ended his career and even prevented him from walking again. \n\nKaka did recover though, and it's something that the deeply religious Brazilian has put down to the help of God, and ever since has given some of his income to his Church. \n\nOnce recovered, he didn't waste time in getting his career restarted.

Mr Wegg took this arrangement in great dudgeon, because the appointed hours were evening hours, and those he considered precious to the progress of the friendly move.

The Wars of the Jews, likewise languishing under Mr Wegg's generalship, Mr Boffin arrived in another cab with Plutarch: whose Lives he found in the sequel extremely entertaining, though he hoped Plutarch might not expect him to believe them all. What to believe, in the course of his reading, was Mr Boffin's chief literary difficulty indeed; for some time he was divided in his mind between half, all, or none; at length, when he decided, as a moderate man, to compound with half, the question still remained, which half?

In April, Gentle said that \"the extradition request is politically motivated.

Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space, such as molecular clouds; detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus. \n\nThe onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. Sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.", "questions": [{"input_text": "what doesn't have a precise definition?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 747, "span_end": 819, "span_text": "the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined", "input_text": "the boundary between visible and infrared light", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "InfraredInfrared_2094f2d20598c8c4f8a40d3853c3eea1feb8d18072fe6f0a4b1478b0"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3634bbtx0ouz9ly85s2ay1sidlpfir", "filename": "high21834.txt", "story": "John and Bobby joined a wholesale company together just after graduation from college the same year.

Lord Fawn did not make his appearance at Richmond on the Saturday evening,--nor was he seen on the Sunday. That Sunday was, we may presume, chiefly devoted to reflection. He certainly did not call upon his future wife. His omission to do so no doubt increased Lizzie's urgency in the matter of her visit to Richmond. Frank Greystock had written to congratulate her. \"Dear Frank,\" she had said in reply, \"a woman situated as I am has so many things to think of. Lord Fawn's position will be of service to my child. Mind you come and see me at Fawn Court. I count so much on your friendship and assistance.\" \n\nOf course she was expected at Richmond,--although throughout the morning Lady Fawn had entertained almost a hope that she wouldn't come. \"He was only lukewarm in defending her,\" Mrs. Hittaway had said in her letter, \"and I still think that there may be an escape.\" Not even a note had come from Lord Fawn himself,--nor from Lady Eustace.

Then it was that Carthoris turned to speak to the girl at his side. \n\nThey must plan together for the future. It was his idea to pass through the cliffs at once if they could locate the passage, and he was quite positive that they were now close to it; but he wanted her assent to the proposition. \n\nAs his eyes rested upon her, he was struck by her strangely ethereal appearance. She seemed suddenly to have dissolved into the tenuous substance of a dream, and as he continued to gaze upon her, she faded slowly from his sight. \n\nFor an instant he was dumbfounded, and then the whole truth flashed suddenly upon him.

Starting with a baseball as center, he painted layer after layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness World Records. Visitors can paint the ball themselves and become part of history. \n\nThe Museum of Dirt \n\nBoston, Mass. \n\nThe museum is the idea of Glenn Johnson. Labeled glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free. \n\nMount Horeb Mustard Museum \n\nMount Horeb, Wis. \n\nIt's heaven for hotdog lovers! This museum claims to have the world's largest collection of prepared mustard . Its more than 4, 100 bottles of spices come from 60 nations, including Turkey and China. Visitors learn the history of mustard, from how it's made to how it's advertised and sold. The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much that he even puts it on ice cream! \n\nPaper House \n\nRockport, Mass. \n\nSwedish immigrant Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much, if any, thought to recycling paper. In fact, \"recycling\" wasn't even a word yet.

A modified version of McCune\u2013Reischauer was the official romanization system in South Korea until 2000, when it was replaced by the Revised Romanization of Korean system. A variant of McCune\u2013Reischauer is still used as the official system in North Korea. \n\nThe system was created in 1937 by George M. McCune and Edwin O. Reischauer. With a few exceptions, it attempts not to transliterate Korean hangul but to represent the phonetic pronunciation. McCune\u2013Reischauer is widely used outside Korea. \n\nKorean has phonologically no distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants, but it phonetically distinguishes them. Aspirated consonants like \"p'\", \"k'\", and \"t'\" are distinguished by apostrophe from unaspirated ones, which may be falsely understood as a separator between syllables (as in \u2192 \"twich'agi\", which consists of the syllables \"twi\", \"ch'a\" and \"gi\"). The apostrophe is also used to mark transcriptions of (\"n'g\") as opposed to (\"ng\"): \u2192 \"chan'g\u016dm\" vs. \u2192 \"chang\u016dm\"). \n\nCritics of the McCune\u2013Reischauer system claim that casual users of the system omit the breves ( \u02d8 ) over the \"o\" for and the \"u\" for because typing \"o\" or \"u\" without the breves is often easier than adding them. That can lead to confusion over whether the \"o\" being romanized is or or the \"u\" being Romanized is or .

He was 88. \n\nHis death was confirmed by the group's website. \n\nFor many years, the Jordanaires were Elvis' go-to backup singers, performing on hits including \"Hound Dog,\" \"Are You Lonesome Tonight\" and \"Crying in the Chapel.\" \n\nThe group also supported Patsy Cline on \"Crazy,\" Jim Reeves on \"Four Walls,\" Kenny Rogers on \"Lucille\" and Jones on \"He Stopped Loving Her Today.\" \n\nOn their own, they generally stuck to gospel, releasing more than a dozen albums over the course of several decades. \n\nThe group met Presley after a performance with Eddy Arnold in 1955. According to a much-told story, after the show the then-unknown Elvis told the group that, if he ever landed a major-label contract -- he was on Memphis' Sun Records at the time -- he'd have the Jordanaires back him up. After Presley joined RCA in 1956, he was true to his word. The group sang with him on both recordings and in concert for the next 14 years. \n\nStoker wasn't an original member of the group, which formed in Springfield, Missouri, in the 1940s. He was hired as its piano player in 1950 and only became a vocalist later -- staying for more than 60 years, generally as its lead tenor. \n\n\"As a longtime member of the vocal quartet the Jordanaires, he helped to influence the sound of gospel, country and pop music with a unique and versatile style while recording with an impressive roster of artists,\" said the Recording Academy in a statement. \"We have lost a gifted and timeless artist who made significant contributions to music and our industry.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was Gordon Stokers job?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What happened to him?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who did he sing back up for?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was the name of Gordon's group?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did they meet Elvis?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What year?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What promise did Elvis make?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "did he keep it?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "how long did they sing with Elvis?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What genre of music were the Jordanaires known for on their own?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What other artists did they work with?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 9, "span_end": 82, "span_text": "Gordon Stoker, who as part of the vocal group the Jordanaires sang backup", "input_text": "he sang backup", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 222, "span_end": 268, "span_text": "His death was confirmed by the group's website", "input_text": "He died", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 157, "span_end": 183, "span_text": "died Wednesday at his home", "input_text": "at his home", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 209, "span_end": 219, "span_text": "He was 88.", "input_text": "88", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 71, "span_end": 107, "span_text": "sang backup on hits by Elvis Presley", "input_text": "Elvis Presley", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 24, "span_end": 70, "span_text": "who as part of the vocal group the Jordanaires", "input_text": "the Jordanaires", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 705, "span_end": 746, "span_text": "The group met Presley after a performance", "input_text": "after a performance", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 727, "span_end": 771, "span_text": "after a performance with Eddy Arnold in 1955", "input_text": "1955", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 864, "span_end": 991, "span_text": "if he ever landed a major-label contract -- he was on Memphis' Sun Records at the time -- he'd have the Jordanaires back him up", "input_text": "if he ever landed a major-label contract he'd have the Jordanaires back him up", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1027, "span_end": 1050, "span_text": "he was true to his word", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1052, "span_end": 1131, "span_text": "The group sang with him on both recordings and in concert for the next 14 years", "input_text": "14 years", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 586, "span_end": 630, "span_text": "On their own, they generally stuck to gospel", "input_text": "gospel", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 54, "span_end": 134, "span_text": " the Jordanaires sang backup on hits by Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, George Jones", "input_text": "Patsy Cline and George Jones", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "cnn_a8fd170d0ff3f6178900977ce422ddcded7c6c43.story"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3ijxv6uz1xjwcb3hwn24fq61ggbrin", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Phillips Oppenheim___The Devil's Paw.txt/CHAPTER XX_9a298a7502e1239cff93bd59a33c19fa79714e282943a9426941351", "story": "CHAPTER XX \n\nJulian and Furley left the place together.

Whether it appears in a newspaper, your school magazine or in your own blog, an article will be something to look back on in pride in later years. 6) Take up a new sport. Choose one you've never played before. If you find you like it, you'll have a hobby for life. 7) Join a club. Working hard in a club or other activities will give you a life outside of your studies. 8) Find a part-time job. Try and do the job for at least a month. 9) Find a person to learn from.

Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \"computer vision syndrome .\" Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\" he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\" he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\" Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two. But not all eye doctors have noticed an increase in problems in children. Dr. David Hunter, from Children's Hospital Boston, has not seen an increase in his practice. \"While it is possible to develop _ looking at screens for a long period of time, there's certainly no proof that it actually causes any damage to the eyes.\" he says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is in Tampa?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is he a dentist there?", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 166, "span_end": 189, "span_text": "Nathan Bonilla-Warford ", "input_text": "Nathan Bonilla-Warford", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 194, "span_end": 206, "span_text": " optometrist", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "middle404.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3n4bptxio8sfyylm0kilxh8yfi7uk6", "filename": "Food_and_Drug_Administration.txt", "story": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, one of the United States federal executive departments.

But brother and sister, Sarah and Bobby Green, became young millionaires when they opened a chain of American-style coffee shops in the UK. Having the idea: It started when Sarah took a weekend trip to New York to visit her brother Bobby. One evening, in a Thai restaurant, Sarah told Bobby how much she wished she could buy American-style coffee in London. Bobby suggested they started their own coffee shop. Sarah fell in love with the idea. Doing the Research: Back in London, she spent a whole day on the London subway, getting off the train at different stations to taste the coffee. \"It was terrible, and I knew there was a gap in the market.\" In 1995, they opened their first Coffee Republic shop in central London. Making it work: The first year was very difficult. British people were not used to the names of American coffees, like latte and macchiato.

He believed it would be found that Jim had been called away on some important business, but that not daring to leave his new shanty exposed and temptingly unprotected, he had made a virtue of necessity by selling it to his neighbors, intending to build a better house on its site after his return. Having comforted Phoebe, and impulsively conceived further plans for restoring Jim to her,--happily without any recurrence of his previous doubts as to his own efficacy as a special Providence,--he returned to the rancho. If he thought again of Jim's defection and Gilroy's warning, it was only to strengthen himself to a clearer perception of his unselfish duty and singleness of purpose. He would give up brooding, apply himself more practically to the management of the property, carry out his plans for the foundation of a Landlords' Protective League for the southern counties, become a candidate for the Legislature, and, in brief, try to fill Peyton's place in the county as he had at the rancho. He would endeavor to become better acquainted with the half-breed laborers on the estate and avoid the friction between them and the Americans; he was conscious that he had not made that use of his early familiarity with their ways and language which he might have done.

Built on an island in Florida's Dry Tortugas, 70 miles past Key West, the fort is being restored by a squad of craftsmen who spend three-week shifts there between hurricane seasons. \n\nA cocoon of mesh and scaffolding shrouds one section of its 8-foot-thick walls as they work. It's a grueling job, but it's one Dennis Wood, a mason from Massachusetts, says he's glad to have. \n\n\"Things are slow today, you know,\" Wood said. \"Got a job offer to come down here for the winter, so we took it.\" \n\nEfforts to restore Fort Jefferson have been under way for about 30 years. The current phase received a boost from the economic stimulus bill that passed Congress in 2009, which devoted $7 million to the project. But planners estimate another $13 million is needed, and that money has yet to be allocated. \n\nThe six-sided fort, roughly the size of Yankee Stadium, was designed to protect shipping lanes through the Gulf of Mexico. Construction began in 1846, but advancements in the science of artillery rendered it obsolete before it was finished.

Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate). \n\nCentral America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property. \n\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America\u2014except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama\u2014was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981).

Trevennack, however, with unvarying tenderness, did his best in every way to calm her fears. Though no word on the subject passed between them directly, he let her feel with singular tact that he meant to keep himself under proper control. Whenever a dangerous topic cropped up in conversation, he would look across at her affectionately, with a reassuring smile. \"For Cleer's sake,\" he murmured often, if she was close by his side; \"for Cleer's sake, dearest!\" and his wife, mutely grateful, knew at once what he meant, and smiled approval sadly. \n\nHer heart was very full; her part was a hard one to play with fitting cheerfulness; but in his very madness itself she couldn't help loving, admiring, and respecting that strong, grave husband who fought so hard against his own profound convictions. \n\nTen months passed away, however, and Eustace Le Neve didn't seem to get much nearer any permanent appointment than ever. He began to tire at last of applying unsuccessfully for every passing vacancy. Now and then he got odd jobs, to be sure; but odd jobs won't do for a man to marry upon; and serious work seemed always to elude him. Walter Tyrrel did his best, no doubt, to hunt up all the directors of all the companies he knew; but no posts fell vacant on any line they were connected with.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, particularly high school and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has also become involved in promoting left-wing political issues and progressive social causes. The network received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. \n\nIn recent years, MTV had struggled with the secular decline of music-related cable media. Its ratings had been said to be failing systematically, as younger viewers increasingly shift towards digital media, with yearly ratings drops as high as 29%; thus there was doubt of the lasting relevance of MTV towards young audiences. In April 2016, MTV announced it would start to return to its original music roots with the reintroduction of the classic MTV series \"MTV Unplugged\".

With an atomic weight of 7000100794000000000\u26601.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.[note 1] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons. \n\nThe universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest.

Hongsheng,a type of Laosheng, have a red face. There are only two roles famous as Hongsheng. One is Guan Gong and the other is Zhao Kuangyin. Wusheng are young generals who are good at martial arts . Xiaosheng are clean-shaven and handsome. Wawasheng are children's parts. Dan----women Roles Dan are women roles that can be divided into different types----Laodan, Qingyi, Huadan, Wudan and Caidan. Laodan play old and clever women. Qingyi are the main women roles. Huashan, a type of Qingyi, was created by Mei Lanfang, who played an important role in shaping Peking Opera. Huadan are lively and unmarried women roles. Wudan characters are women, good at martial arts. Caidan are clowns in funny plays. Jing----Painted Face Men Roles A Jing role is an important man character with striking looks and high social position. The main types of Jing are Tongchui, good at singing and usually a general; Jiazi, good at acting with less singing; and Wujing, a martial arts and acrobatics role. Chou----Comedy Roles Chou are comedy roles in Peking Opera. There are Wenchou who speak, act and sing, and Wuchou who both speak and fight.

In some villages the Catholics predominated, and here the passage of the little party was regarded with frowning brows and muttered threats; by the Huguenots they were saluted respectfully, and if they halted, many questions were asked their followers as to news about the intentions of the court, the last rumours as to the attitude of Conde, and the prospects of a continuance of peace. \n\nHere, too, great respect was paid to Marie and Philip when it was known they were relatives of the Countess de Laville, and belonged to the family of the De Moulins. Emilie had for some time been a widow--the count, her husband, having fallen at the battle of Dreux, at the end of the year 1562--but being an active and capable woman, she had taken into her hands the entire management of the estates, and was one of the most influential among the Huguenot nobles of that part of the country. \n\nFrom their last halting place, Marie Vaillant sent on a letter by one of the men to her sister, announcing their coming.

It is generally considered a field of biology, but intersects frequently with many other life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems. \n\nThe father of genetics is Gregor Mendel, a late 19th-century scientist and Augustinian friar. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene. \n\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domain of life, including bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. \n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate. While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the \"father\" of genetics?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did he study?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "In what organism?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Through what did he discover the plants inherited their traits?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "A more precisely defined version of this is called what?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What field includes genetics?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Is it strictly contained within biology?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is is strongly connected with?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Name one subfield of genetics.", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What kinds of organisms are studied in genetics?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Can the work of genes be switched on and off?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "By what?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 252, "span_end": 290, "span_text": "The father of genetics is Gregor Mende", "input_text": "Gregor Mendel", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 345, "span_end": 383, "span_text": " Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", p", "input_text": "trait inheritance", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 452, "span_end": 491, "span_text": "He observed that organisms (pea plants)", "input_text": "pea plants", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 507, "span_end": 548, "span_text": "by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\"", "input_text": "by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\"", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 602, "span_end": 649, "span_text": " definition of what is referred to as a gene. \n", "input_text": "a gene.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 113, "span_end": 132, "span_text": " field of biology, ", "input_text": "biology,", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 129, "span_end": 188, "span_text": "y, but intersects frequently with many other life sciences ", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 194, "span_end": 250, "span_text": " strongly linked with the study of information systems.

farewell, after Abner should see a little more of the bustle and confusion that had so fascinated him in the afternoon. \n\nTo that end the boys walked around the enclosure, listened to the men who were loudly crying the wonderful things they had for sale, and all the while kept a bright lookout in the hope of seeing some of their circus friends. \n\nIt was nearly time for the performance to

to hold her home in view And sails as if the path she knew, So calm and stately in her motion Across the unfathomed, trackless ocean. -- WILSON. \n\nIt has been said that Peter was in advance. When his canoe was nearly abreast of the usual landing at the hut, he saw two canoes coming out from among the rice, and distant from him not more than a hundred yards. At a greater distance, indeed, it would not have been easy to distinguish such an object on the water at all. Instead of attempting to avoid these two canoes, the chief instantly called to them, drawing the attention of those in them to himself, speaking so loud as to be easily overheard by those who followed. \n\n\"My young men are too late,\" he said. \"The pale-faces have been seen in the openings above by our warriors, and must soon be here. Let us land, and be ready to meet them at the wigwam.\" \n\nPeter's voice was immediately recognized. The confident, quiet, natural manner in which he spoke served to mislead those in the canoes; and when he joined them, and entered the passage among the rice that led to the landing, preceding the others, the last followed him as regularly as the colt follows its dam. Le Bourdon heard the conversation, and understood the movement, though he could not see the canoes.

Davis is so much like her character, adorable and upbeat, I expect Carrie or Samantha to drop in on our conversation and say something to shock her. \n\nAs any true fan knows ... OK ... as every woman knows, watching \"Sex and the City\" was like being front row at a fashion show with a plot. TV show and movie costume designer Patricia Field dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of New York City in $600 stilettos. \n\nBut is this reality? Most sane women wouldn't choose to walk even one city block in high heels. And most women certainly can't spend a month's rent on a belt or bag, even if they have a truly fabulous party to wear it to. \n\nSo, what about us, the fashionistas on a budget? Are we to be ignored, forced to wear boring clothing and practical shoes? Luckily, no; designers are catching on. \n\nTarget features affordable lines from high-end designers like Alexander McQueen and Isaac Mizrahi. All of the pieces in Sarah Jessica Parker's clothing line Bitten cost less than $20 before the clothing store that carried them went under.

We finished all the preparations 10 minutes earlier than expected, then Beth and I talked for a while, Matthew sang several English songs and did some stand-up comedy at the party. We all praised him. When the bell rang to end the first school day, none of us wanted to leave. When I went back home, I had a little headache.

They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. \n\nKate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in \"Revolutionary Road.\" \n\nThe myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by ... the suburbs. \n\nThe best thing about \"Revolutionary Road,\" a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. \n\nFrank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things.

More and more posts began to arrive for him. He bought a new suit for himself and invited his parents to the theatre and for dinner afterwards at the most expensive restaurant in town. When his proud parents arrived home after their evening hour, a policeman was waiting at the front door. \n\n\"John Smith,\" he said as he handed him a piece of paper, \"I'll see you in the court tomorrow.\" \n\nWhen he got outside, Johnny told his parents everything. \"When you told me to earn some money, I decided to put an advertisement in the newspaper saying, 'New way to money fast! Send me $ 5 and I'll tell you my secret.' When I received the money I wrote back telling people to do as I do.\" \n\nJohnny was fined $250 by the court and was ordered to pay all the people back.

Krovac had testified that Torrance had made threats against Compton in his presence, and there was no way in which Jimmy's attorneys could refute the perjured statement.

Dr. Stephen Spiro, a professor of the British Lung Foundation, said the further the particles travel, the less dangerous they will be. \"The cloud has already passed over northern Scotland and we haven't heard of any ill effects there,\" he said.

University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear.

This morning, however, she met nobody and heard only the sounds of animals. Some time later, Andi got to the steep slope , she climbed up to the top by using her hands. When she finally reached the top, she noticed a dark shape several inches from her left foot. She was frightened and then looked carefully. \"It's a dog and it's dead.\" she said to herself. It took her a few seconds to realize that the dog's eyes were open. A thin, dirty bull dog was looking at her. She greeted in a low and soft voice to show she was friendly. The bull dog shook when he heard her voice. Andi inched closer and dropped some water into the dog's mouth. He tried to stand up but failed. Something was wrong with his left front leg. Andi pulled out her phone to contact her husband, Jason, but he didn't _ . She knew that if she didn't carry the dog down the mountain, he would die. She carefully put her arms under the dog's body. He was so weak that he fell into her chest. Andi had great trouble going down the steep, rocky mountainside with the 50-pound animal in her arms. Even her arms and back started aching, she didn't give up. The trip up had taken 30 minutes while going back down took twice that. Andi's husband received her messages at last. He and their son, Justin, jumped into the car and drove to pick up Andi. Later that morning, an X-ray showed that the bull dog was badly hurt, he was likely to lose his left leg. A few days later, the Davises returned to the animal hospital. \"The first thing he did was to give me a kiss, then he went right to my son.\" Andi said.

Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli.

This entails that information is maintained over short periods of time. Finally the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored. Such information must be located and returned to the consciousness. Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information, and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons. \n\nShort-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code. Conrad (1964) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar (e.g. E, P, D). Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically.

She felt as if her heedless avowals had been high treason to her husband; and yet Harriet was her elder, and those assurances that as a true woman she was bound to clear up the mystery, made her cheeks burn with shame, and her heart thrill with the determination to vindicate her husband, while the longing to know the face of one who so loved her was freshly awakened. \n\nShe was strongly inclined to tell him all, indeed she knew herself well enough to be aware that half a dozen searching questions would draw out the whole confession of her own communication and Harriet's unworthy suspicions; and humiliating as this would be, she longed for the opportunity. Here, however, she was checked in her meditations by a stumble of her horse, which proved to have lost a shoe. It was necessary to leave the short cut, and make for the nearest forge, and when the mischief was repaired, to ride home by the high road. \n\nShe thus came home much later than had been expected; Jumbo, Molly, and the little girls were all watching for her, and greeted her eagerly.

He has incorporated both eastern and western ideas into his designs. \n\nIeoh Ming Pei was born in Guangzhou, China on April 26, 1917. His father was a famous banker. In 1935, at the age of 17, he came to the United States to study architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1942, he entered the Harvard Graduate School of Design. \n\nIn 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy selected Pei to design the Kennedy library. After that he became well-known all over the world. People named it one of the Ten Best Buildings in the United States. In 1968, Pei started work on the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, in Washington D.C. Over one million people visited the building during its first 50 days in existence. \n\nFollowing the East Wing project Pei's fame has continued to grow widely. In 1983, French President commissioned Pei to help make the Louvre more modern. Ten years later, the completion of Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre created a new historic landmark for Paris.

I have been there three times without finding her. I think I can set this terrible matter right by speaking to her.' \n\nAccordingly, Lilias and Phyllis set out with Alethea and Marianne one afternoon to Mrs. Eden's cottage, which stood at the edge of a long field at the top of the hill. Very fast did Lily talk all the way, but she grew more silent as she came to the cottage, and knocked at the door; it was opened by Mrs. Eden herself, a pale, but rather pretty young woman, with a remarkable gentle and pleasing face, and a manner which was almost ladylike, although her hands were freshly taken out of the wash-tub. She curtsied low, and coloured at the sight of Lilias, set chairs for the visitors, and then returned to her work. \n\n'Oh!

People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \"genes\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \"word\" means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Her father, Karl Wilhelm Mutter, and her mother, Gerlinde, considered music lessons part of a good education. Thus, their son, Andreas, began practicing the violin at eight, and his younger brother, Christoph, had piano lessons. It came as no surprise when Anne-Sophie said she wanted a violin for her fifth birthday. \n\nHer parents thought she was too young for the violin, and persuaded her to start on the piano.
