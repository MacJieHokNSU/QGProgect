The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser from power. After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders. The episode humiliated Great Britain and France and strengthened Nasser. \n\nOn 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block the canal to all shipping. It later became clear that the Israeli invasion and the subsequent Anglo-French attack had been planned beforehand by the three countries. \n\nThe three allies had attained a number of their military objectives, but the Canal was now useless. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the USSR led to a withdrawal. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade; he now threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds. Historians conclude the crisis \"signified the end of Great Britain's role as one of the world's major powers\". The Suez Canal was closed from October 1956 until March 1957. Israel fulfilled some of its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the invasion of Egypt in 1956 Called?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was another name for it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And the other name?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who infiltrated them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And then?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "and?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who tried to shut this all down?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who did it make look poorly?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who did it make look good?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why was the canal the center of the fight?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 159, "span_text": "The Suez Crisis, also named the Tripartite Aggression (in the Arab world) and Operation Kadesh or Sinai War (in Israel), was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 ", "input_text": "The Suez Crisis", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 53, "span_text": "The Suez Crisis, also named the Tripartite Aggression", "input_text": "the Tripartite Aggression", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 78, "span_end": 119, "span_text": "Operation Kadesh or Sinai War (in Israel)", "input_text": "Operation Kadesh or Sinai War", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 127, "span_end": 168, "span_text": " invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel", "input_text": "Israel", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 170, "span_end": 211, "span_text": "followed by the United Kingdom and France", "input_text": "the United Kingdom and France", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 213, "span_end": 334, "span_text": "The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser from power.", "input_text": "for control of the Suez Canal a", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 213, "span_end": 333, "span_text": "The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser from power", "input_text": "to remove Gamal Abdel Nasser from power", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 366, "span_end": 494, "span_text": " political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders.

Simpson's legal \"dream team\" -- is now defending actress Lindsay Lohan, according to Lohan's father. \n\nLohan's former lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, resigned last week shortly after releasing a statement about her client's \"harsh and unfair\" sentence. Lohan was ordered Tuesday to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehab program after her jail term is completed. \n\nThe actress must begin serving her sentence on July 20. \n\nMichael Lohan sent an e-mail to CNN Thursday stating that Shapiro had been hired, and expressing hope that his daughter's sentence would be reevaluated if she is allowed to attend rehab first. \n\n\"Bob (Shapiro) is representing her,\" Lohan wrote. \"But tell me, why is (it) that I had to cry from the mountain for Lindsay to listen to me, and now finally she is doing what I said? None of this would have happened if Lindsay and (her mother) Dina had. I was telling Dina and Lindsay this for years now.

It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called phonemics, or phonematics), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning. Phonology also includes the study of equivalent organizational systems in sign languages. \n\nThe word phonology (as in the phonology of English) can also refer to the phonological system (sound system) of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise, like its syntax and its vocabulary. \n\nPhonology is often distinguished from phonetics. While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics, and phonology to theoretical linguistics, although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century.

A good chunk of the credit should go to Johns. He's a co-producer on the film, but he's also responsible for giving the character top billing recently in comics and, ultimately, in pop culture. \n\nJohns brought Hal Jordan back to life in the \"Green Lantern: Rebirth\" series and went on to cast the emerald warrior's world as the focal point of the DC Universe in the popular \"Blackest Night\" comic event. \n\nNow, he's taking on DC's newest large-scale series: \"Flashpoint,\" a world in which everything you know will change in a Flash.

He's open-minded, he's listening.\" \n\n_ said he would do all he could to prevent trade relations between the countries from getting worse. \n\nLast week, Ma met with Trump at the Trump Tower in New York City. The Chinese billionaire is said to have discussed a plan to permit one million small U.S. businesses to sell goods on Alibaba's online shopping platform. \n\nDuring the campaign and after winning the presidential election, Trump strongly criticized the Chinese government's support for its businesses. He blamed unfair trade policies for taking away U.S. jobs.

The companies say the cost of doing business in China is increasing. They add that rules and regulations are unclear or not enforced in a consistent way. \n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in China led the study, which looked at responses from 462 companies. \n\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the chamber.

In 1956 Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was subsequently forced to withdraw, but won a guarantee that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. Whilst the United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, there was no demilitarisation agreement. \n\nIn the period leading up to June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the straits of Tiran to its shipping would be a \"casus belli\" and in late May Nasser announced the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels. Egypt then mobilised its forces along its border with Israel, and on 5 June Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields.

FBI Agent Michael Carazza testified that agents found 30 weapons inside the apartment, some of them hidden behind living room and bathroom walls. \n\nThe evidence photographs show several handguns, one automatic rifle and a hand grenade the FBI says was recovered after it arrested Bulger in late June at the small apartment only a few blocks from the beach. \n\nThe government also released a brief security camera video of Greig walking in and out of a local drugstore, picking up a prescription, prosecutors said, that was under an assumed name. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. \n\nOne neighbor, 88-year-old Catalina Schlank, told CNN that the couple was always friendly to her.

new deal with Bayern Munich. \n\nThe 33-year-old leaves the Bavarian giants after four years at the club, although he endured a disappointing season just gone, scoring just once after making most of his 20 appearances from the substitutes' bench. \n\nKlose, who is joint second with compatriot Gerd Mueller in the list of all-time World Cup scorers with 14 goals in three different tournaments, told reporters: \"I am looking forward to this new experience and want to help Lazio get back up the Serie A table.\" \n\nLiverpool close to Henderson deal \n\nSpeaking about the transfer, Lazio sporting director Igli Tare told German channel Sport1: \"We hope he brings his skills to us and scores the goals to put Lazio back up where we belong, to be one of Europe's biggest clubs.\" \n\nKlose, who has netted 61 goals in 109 appearances for Germany and is closing in on Mueller's all-time record of 68 goals, is keen to play in the finals of Euro 2012 and his move hias been welcomed by his national coach Joachim Loew. \n\nLoew told reporters: \"It's good for Miroslav if he plays at a club where he is used regularly again.\" \n\nKlose made his debut for Germany in March 2001, in a 2-1 victory

This makes it difficult for his body to cool down naturally.

Now while other children look forward to playing outside in the sunshine, Thomas is applying his new activity at the Snow Zone in Castleford, in temperatures of about -5degC. Mr. Pettigrew said, \"When Thomas tries most sports, he has to stop when he gets too hot but that never happens with snowboarding. I was surprised at how good he was when he started.

He's been so enthusiastic about his snowboarding that he's even persuaded me to have a go, so we can enjoy it together.\" \n\nThomas's parents have spent the past 10 years watching the schoolboy for any signs of overheating, only taking him on holiday in the cooler months. \"He has no energy and no interest in doing anything if he overheats and we do whatever it takes to cool his temperature, such as putting him in the car with the air conditioner working or running cold baths.\" \n\nAiden Harington, head of the ski school at Snow Zone, said, \"Snow sports are a great way for anyone to keep fit, but seem to be particularly beneficial to Thomas as he is able to make sure he stays cool. Thomas does very well in snowboarding, and he can now perform plenty of freestyle actions. I'm sure that he will continue to progress in the coming months, and hopefully take part in some of our freestyle events.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which type of sport is a great way to stay in shape?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who runs the ski school?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is the name of the school?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Why can't the kid do regular phys ed stuff?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does it cause?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who had the notion to bring Thomas to the mountain?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did he have this idea?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How cold is it where they are skiing?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the result when Thomas engages in most activities?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why>", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Does that happen with snowboarding?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was he good at riding when he first tried?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How often does he get up to the slopes?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Has he got anyone else to try riding with him?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How does Thomas cool off when he gets too hot and isn't in the snow?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Any other way?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Can they go snowboarding any time of the year?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1519, "span_end": 1569, "span_text": "Snow sports are a great way for anyone to keep fit", "input_text": "Snow sports", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1458, "span_end": 1510, "span_text": "Aiden Harington, head of the ski school at Snow Zone", "input_text": "Aiden Harington", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 1458, "span_end": 1510, "span_text": "Aiden Harington, head of the ski school at Snow Zone", "input_text": "Snow Zone", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 192, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "The youngster can't join in PE lessons at school, because he suffers from a rare condition, which means his body dangerously overheats", "input_text": "he has a rare condition", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 192, "span_end": 326, "span_text": "The youngster can't join in PE lessons at school, because he suffers from a rare condition, which means his body dangerously overheats", "input_text": "his body to overheat", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 484, "span_end": 554, "span_text": "His father Richard came up with the idea of taking Thomas snowboarding", "input_text": "His father", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 484, "span_end": 503, "span_text": "His father Richard ", "input_text": "Richard", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 484, "span_end": 569, "span_text": "His father Richard came up with the idea of taking Thomas snowboarding in March, 2010", "input_text": "2010", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 645, "span_end": 744, "span_text": "Thomas is applying his new activity at the Snow Zone in Castleford, in temperatures of about -5degC", "input_text": "-5degC", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 767, "span_end": 812, "span_text": "When Thomas tries most sports, he has to stop", "input_text": "he has to stop", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 766, "span_end": 834, "span_text": "\"When Thomas tries most sports, he has to stop when he gets too hot ", "input_text": "he gets too hot", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 837, "span_end": 874, "span_text": " that never happens with snowboarding", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 875, "span_end": 928, "span_text": " I was surprised at how good he was when he started.

She and Jorth were alone in this cabin. It contained nothing besides their beds and a rank growth of weeds along the decayed lower logs. Half of the cabin had a rude ceiling of rough-hewn boards which formed a kind of loft. This attic extended through to the adjoining cabin, forming the ceiling of the porch-like space between the two structures. There was no partition. A ladder of two aspen saplings, pegged to the logs, and with braces between for steps, led up to the attic. \n\nEllen smelled wood smoke and the odor of frying meat, and she heard the voices of men. She looked out to see that Slater and Somers had joined their party--an addition that might have strengthened it for defense, but did not lend her own situation anything favorable. Somers had always appeared the one best to avoid. \n\nColter espied her and called her to \"Come an' feed your pale face.\" His comrades laughed, not loudly, but guardedly, as if noise was something to avoid.

Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler. Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship. When Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support. Defoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe's time.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the first English novel?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was it based off?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was charged for being bad in church?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Did he accept his penatily?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What did he do?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Defoe has been earning income by writing since what age?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which political party did he support?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was he considered a man with morals?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did he do three times a week?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What age did he write Robinson Crusoe?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "And the year he wrote it?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 424, "span_end": 468, "span_text": "Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel.", "input_text": "Robinson Crusoe", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 577, "span_end": 596, "span_text": "English scribbler.

Then my parents' marriage ended and Mum began the study of precious stones. Her interest in opals took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money. My mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends. It was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile. Then, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year. People who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents. Then there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle. Danny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\" It's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the author's mom?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did she study?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What gem was she looking for there?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Are they valuable?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was she successful in her search?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What illness did she end up having?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did she stay in Lightning Ridge?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was she planning to cook?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did she end up doing it?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who did?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 25, "span_text": "My mother, Marisol Torres", "input_text": "Marisol Torres", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 131, "span_end": 155, "span_text": "study of precious stones", "input_text": "precious stones", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 157, "span_end": 242, "span_text": "Her interest in opals took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge.", "input_text": "Lightning Ridge.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 156, "span_end": 179, "span_text": " Her interest in opals ", "input_text": "opals", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 666, "span_end": 688, "span_text": "never very successful.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 794, "span_end": 816, "span_text": "diagnosed with cancer ", "input_text": "cancer", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 828, "span_end": 854, "span_text": "eturn south for treatment.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 880, "span_end": 900, "span_text": "cooking Spanish food", "input_text": "Spanish food", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 880, "span_end": 958, "span_text": "cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 974, "span_end": 1018, "span_text": " my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire", "input_text": "her child and Marisa", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high3312.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "31euonyn2v3y14v132kj0krqdw4voy", "filename": "2000_Summer_Olympics.txt", "story": "The 2000 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXVII Olympiad and commonly known as Sydney 2000 or the Millennium Olympic Games/Games of the New Millennium, were an international multi-sport event which was held between 15 September and 1 October 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Tottenham camped in the Pompey half, Dindane broke clear and although Palacios got the ball in his challenge he also pulled him down and Wiley had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. \n\nSpurs

There is something sadly lost in history. 911 for US Emergency Calls Early phones didn't use phone numbers--the operator had to connect your call by hand--and this led to the need for an emergency code . But later phone numbers became popular, that changed. In 1967, 911 was chosen as the nationwide emergency call because it was easy to remember and could be quickly dialed on the phone. 26.2 Miles in a Marathon The story began with an ancient Greek soldier carrying message from a battlefield in Marathon to Athens. The modern marathon was born as a flagship event in the first Olympic Games, in 1896, with a distance of about 25 miles (40 km), as long as the distance from Marathon to Athens. But race organizers for the 1908 Olympic Games in London wanted to add something special. The race began at Windsor Castle and ended at White City Stadium, with runners finishing only after passing the royal box. The distance was 26.2 miles (42.1 km). And since 1924 this distance has been kept in marathon. 28 Days in February Before using the Gregorian calendar that we use today, one of the first Roman calendars had only 304 days and ten months (March through December), with six months of 30 days and four of 31 days. The second king of Rome improved the old calendar. He added 50 days for January and February. To make the new months longer, he took one day from each of the 30-day months, making 56 days to divide between January and February (or 28 days each). Later January was given one more day to add up to 355 days a year, but February still had 28 days. That's how it became the shortest month and it stayed that way ever since.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What about them?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "For example?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How did that come about?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "It was 26.2 miles?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "So how did they get to 26.2?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Why did they change it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "And that was 26.2?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What other numbers have a weird history?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where did those come from?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What does that mean?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What about twelve?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Any others?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Why is that used?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why do the numbers 13 and after end in \"teen\"?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What other numbers have a fascinating history?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How did that come to be?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When did they change it?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did he do?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "So how did they get to 28?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 31, "span_text": "Where did that number come from", "input_text": "Numbers", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 31, "span_text": "Where did that number come from", "input_text": "Where did that number come from", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 683, "span_end": 707, "span_text": "26.2 Miles in a Marathon", "input_text": "26.2 Miles in a Marathon", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 729, "span_end": 811, "span_text": "an ancient Greek soldier carrying message from a battlefield in Marathon to Athens", "input_text": "an ancient Greek soldier carrying message from a battlefield in Marathon to Athens", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 924, "span_end": 932, "span_text": "25 miles", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1019, "span_end": 1047, "span_text": "1908 Olympic Games in London", "input_text": "1908 Olympic Games in London", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1081, "span_end": 1202, "span_text": "The race began at Windsor Castle and ended at White City Stadium, with runners finishing only after passing the royal box", "input_text": "The race began at Windsor Castle and ended at White City Stadium, with runners finishing only after passing the royal box", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1204, "span_end": 1231, "span_text": "The distance was 26.2 miles", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 33, "span_end": 50, "span_text": "Eleven and Twelve", "input_text": "Eleven and Twelve", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 123, "span_end": 146, "span_text": "the German term ainlif,", "input_text": "the German term ainlif,", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 167, "span_end": 177, "span_text": "\"one left\"", "input_text": "\"one left\"", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 223, "span_end": 241, "span_text": "twalif--\"two left\"", "input_text": "twalif--\"two left\"", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 336, "span_end": 362, "span_text": "911 for US Emergency Calls", "input_text": "911 for US Emergency Calls", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 617, "span_end": 681, "span_text": "it was easy to remember and could be quickly dialed on the phone", "input_text": "it was easy to remember and could be quickly dialed on the phone", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 334, "span_text": "There is something sadly lost in history", "input_text": "There is something sadly lost in history", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1299, "span_end": 1318, "span_text": "28 Days in February", "input_text": "28 Days in February", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1381, "span_end": 1424, "span_text": "the first Roman calendars had only 304 days", "input_text": "the first Roman calendars had only 304 days", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1514, "span_end": 1537, "span_text": "The second king of Rome", "input_text": "The second king of Rome", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1565, "span_end": 1606, "span_text": "He added 50 days for January and February", "input_text": "He added 50 days for January and February", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1639, "span_end": 1740, "span_text": "he took one day from each of the 30-day months, making 56 days to divide between January and February", "input_text": "he took one day from each of the 30-day months, making 56 days to divide between January and February", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "middle5382.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3c44yunsi1pusn7grhx4jyq9nn8dpw", "filename": "high15361.txt", "story": "Linus Pauling,the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,was born in Portland,Oregon. He attended Washington High School but because of an unimportant detail he did not receive his diploma until 1962,long after he had received his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Orgon State College in 1922. He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it. \n\nHe won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \"behavior\" of molecules led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\"building blocks of life\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell. \n\nDuring World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures. \n\nFrom then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.

He was at one time a close friend of C.\u00a0S.\u00a0Lewis\u2014they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings.

These, together with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings. \n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre.

Does the term destroy the confidence of young girls? \n\nThe campaign claims that terms like \"bossy\" are improperly applied to females, preventing schoolgirls from seeing themselves as future \"leaders\". From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\". As late as 2008, the word appeared in reference to females four times more often than males, claim the Ban Bossy campaigners. \"To me, the reference is always is association with women,\" says Helen Trim, director of Fresh Minds. \"I have three brothers and my family still call me 'bossy' today.\" Her father is the only other family member who could be considered in that way, says Trim, but nobody would ever call him so. \n\nSome educators recommend that the word should be reclaimed, rather than banned.\"But the thing with'bossy' is that there's an infantile element to it,\"says Sara Mills, professor at Sheffield University. \"You think of 'bossy' as being like a little kid who's claiming more than he has the right to claim.\" \n\nIt's not just\"bossy\"under fire.\"Pushy\"is another target.

Therefore, members of a group are assumed to share a common history and are considered to be closely related. \n\nThe techniques and nomenclature of cladistics have been applied to other disciplines. (See phylogenetic nomenclature.) \n\nThe original methods used in cladistic analysis and the school of taxonomy derived from the work of the German entomologist Willi Hennig, who referred to it as phylogenetic systematics (also the title of his 1966 book); the terms \"cladistics\" and \"clade\" were popularized by other researchers. Cladistics in the original sense refers to a particular set of methods used in phylogenetic analysis, although it is now sometimes used to refer to the whole field. \n\nWhat is now called the cladistic method appeared as early as 1901 with a work by Peter Chalmers Mitchell for birds and subsequently by Robert John Tillyard (for insects) in 1921, and W. Zimmermann (for plants) in 1943. The term \"clade\" was introduced in 1958 by Julian Huxley after having been coined by Lucien Cu\u00e9not in 1940, \"cladogenesis\" in 1958, \"cladistic\" by Cain and Harrison in 1960, \"cladist\" (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by Mayr in 1965, and \"cladistics\" in 1966. Hennig referred to his own approach as \"phylogenetic systematics\". From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1970s, cladistics competed as an analytical and philosophical approach to phylogenetic inference with phenetics and so-called evolutionary taxonomy. Phenetics was championed at this time by the numerical taxonomists Peter Sneath and Robert Sokal and the evolutionary taxonomist Ernst Mayr.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the main topic?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's the word's country of origin?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How long ago did it appear?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "By who?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did anyone else write about it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who was next?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many years later?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was his focus?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who was next?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What was his focus?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How are organisms classified under this approach?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who coined \"clade\"?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 10, "span_text": "Cladistics", "input_text": "Cladistics", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 12, "span_end": 33, "span_text": "from Greek , \"klados\"", "input_text": "from Greek , \"klados\"", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 54, "span_end": 275, "span_text": "an approach to biological classification in which organisms are categorized based on shared derived characteristics that can be traced to a group's most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant ancestors", "input_text": "an approach to biological classification in which organisms are categorized based on shared derived characteristics that can be traced to a group's most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant ancestors", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 989, "span_end": 1036, "span_text": " the cladistic method appeared as early as 1901", "input_text": "as early as 1901", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1037, "span_end": 1075, "span_text": "with a work by Peter Chalmers Mitchell", "input_text": "by Peter Chalmers Mitchell", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1037, "span_end": 1085, "span_text": "with a work by Peter Chalmers Mitchell for birds", "input_text": "with a work about birds", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 634, "span_end": 729, "span_text": "Willi Hennig, who referred to it as phylogenetic systematics (also the title of his 1966 book);", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1105, "span_end": 1148, "span_text": " Robert John Tillyard (for insects) in 1921", "input_text": "Robert John Tillyard", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1032, "span_end": 1148, "span_text": "1901 with a work by Peter Chalmers Mitchell for birds and subsequently by Robert John Tillyard (for insects) in 1921", "input_text": "20", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1106, "span_end": 1140, "span_text": "Robert John Tillyard (for insects)", "input_text": "insects", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1154, "span_end": 1188, "span_text": "W.

It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day.

Pious, just and honorable, intending the best; but losing his memory, and incapable of business, as he now complained. In his sixtieth year he had married a second time, a young Brunswick Princess, with whose foolish Brother, Eric, he had much trouble; and who at last herself took so ill with the insolence and violence of these intrusive Councillors and Theologians, that the household-life she led beside her old Husband and them became intolerable to her; and she withdrew to another residence,--a little Hunting-seat at Neuhausen, half a dozen miles from Konigsberg;--and there, or at Labiau still farther off, lived mostly, in a separate condition, for the rest of her life. Separate for life:--nevertheless they happened to die on the same day; 20th March, 1568, they were simultaneously delivered from their troubles in this world. [Hubner, t. 181; Stenzel, i. 342.] \n\nAlbert left one Son; the second child of this last Wife: his one child by the former Wife, a daughter now of good years, was married to the Duke of Mecklenburg.

Never before had he felt so comfortable. He wanted to hop, skip and jump. The soft, undressed buckskin was as warm and smooth as silk-plush; the weight so light, the moccasins so well-fitting and springy, that he had to put himself under considerable restraint to keep from capering about like a frolicsome colt. \n\nThe possession of this buckskin outfit, and the rifle and accouterments which went with the bargain, marked the last stage in Joe's surrender to the border fever. The silent, shaded glens, the mystery of the woods, the breath of this wild, free life claimed him from this moment entirely and forever. \n\nHe met the others, however, with a serene face, showing no trace of the emotion which welled up strongly from his heart. Nell glanced shyly at him; Kate playfully voiced her admiration; Jim met him with a brotherly ridicule which bespoke his affection as well as his amusement; but Colonel Zane, having once yielded to the same burning, riotous craving for freedom which now stirred in the boy's heart, understood, and felt warmly drawn toward the lad. He said nothing, though as he watched Joe his eyes were grave and kind. In his long frontier life, where many a day measured the life and fire of ordinary years, he had seen lad after lad go down before this forest fever. It was well, he thought, because the freedom of the soil depended on these wild, light-footed boys; yet it always made him sad.

Today, he adds, that figure has risen to almost 200. It's a nice line, although in reality the emergence of a new nation remains relatively rare. \n\nBut there does seem to be a pattern emerging, in Europe and beyond. In Spain (Catalonia) and Belgium (Flanders), as well as the United Kingdom (Scotland), secessionist movements appear to be on the rise. All three have existed for decades, yet they seem particularly lively in the second decade of the 21st century. \n\nThus Salmond, who this weekend addresses delegates at the Scottish National Party's annual conference in the Scottish city of Perth, likes to talk of Scotland's \"home rule journey\" being part of a bigger international trend. His point is clear: \"independence,\" far from being dangerous or unusual, is a natural state of affairs. \n\nProfessor Robert Young, an expert in secession, says all three countries have a history of regional -- or devolved -- government (relatively recently in the case of the UK). \"I was considering the old question,\" he says, \"about whether regional government structures aid or inhibit secessionist movements. \n\n\"It seems to me that they aid them, other things being equal. The secessionist party will come to power, sooner or later, because governments become unpopular. If they then govern well, this serves as a further mobilizing mechanism.\" \n\nOnly recently a secessionist movement, the nationalist party Converg\u00e8ncia i Uni\u00f3 first took office in Catalonia in 1980, while in Scotland the SNP formed a minority government in 2007 -- becoming a majority four years later.

His father is sitting close to it, in his arm-chair, his hands upon his knees, his face lifted to the sunlight, with chin slightly outstretched, and his pale eyes feeling for the light. The expression would have been painful, but for its perfect sweetness and resignation. His countenance is not, perhaps, a strong one; but its delicacy, and calm, and the high forehead, and the long white locks, are most venerable. With a blind man's exquisite sense, he feels Tom's shadow fall on him, and starts, and calls him by name; for he has been expecting him, and thinking of nothing else all the morning, and takes for granted that it must be he. \n\nIn another moment Tom is at his father's side. What need to describe the sacred joy of those first few minutes, even if it were possible?

They had so much fun. They played with the foam noodles in the pool. Erin accidentally kicked Jennifer's leg in the pool. After they swam, everyone rinsed off and went inside. They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV. After it got dark, they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories. Sally tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon after. Cathy got scared when they were telling stories, and wanted to call her mom to go home.

Gennaco, a consultant whose rate is $260 an hour, to examine the police department's policies and practices, city spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick said. \n\nThe council then approved 4-1 a second contract, also for up to a year, paying Gennaco $30,000 to prepare a public report looking at the July 5 incident involving police and the death of Kelly Thomas, Mudrick said. \n\nGennaco told the council he will begin investigating the death after the Orange County District Attorney's office completes its own inquiry into the incident, Mudrick said. Gennaco is currently chief attorney for a civilian oversight committee created by the Los Angeles County supervisors to monitor the sheriff's department. \n\nThomas, 37, died five days after what the Orange County district attorney has called \"a violent and desperate struggle\" last month with Fullerton police. \n\nMeanwhile, a Los Angeles attorney said he is planning to file a police brutality lawsuit in federal court this week against Fullerton officers in a new unrelated case. But one of the officers in that case was also involved in the Thomas arrest, said the attorney, Garo Mardirossian. \n\nMardirossian is also representing Thomas' father, Ron, who is alleging that his son was a victim of police brutality and has notified Fullerton city officials that he plans to pursue legal action against them.

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold. My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior. Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

The maritime state was visited by Spain's Magellan Expedition in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 Castilian War. \n\nDuring the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak (Kuching) to James Brooke and installed him as the White Rajah, and it ceded Sabah to the British North Borneo Chartered Company. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate and was assigned a British resident as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during World War II, in 1959 a new constitution was written.

Bell used the award to fund the Volta Laboratory (\"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory\") in Washington, D.C., in collaboration with Sumner Tainter and Bell's cousin Chichester Bell. The laboratory is also variously known as the \"Volta Bureau\", the \"Bell Carriage House\", the \"Bell Laboratory\" and the \"Volta Laboratory\". The laboratory focused on the analysis, recording, and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the \"[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\".

About that time, rumors came in, not so favorable, from the Duke of Bevern; which Friedrich, strong in hope, strove visibly to disbelieve, but at last could not. Bevern reports that Daun is actually coming on, far too strong for his resisting;--in other terms, that the Siege of Prag will not decide itself by bombardment, but otherwise and elsewhere. Of which we must now give some account; brief as may be, especially in regard to the preliminary or marching part. \n\nDaun, whose light troops plundered Brandeis (almost within wind of the Prussian Rear) on the day while Prag Battle was fighting, had, on that fatal event, gradually drawn back to Czaslau, a place we used to know fifteen years ago; and there, or in those neighborhoods, defensively manoeuvring, and hanging upon Kuttenberg, Kolin, especially upon his Magazine of Suchdol, Daun, always rather drawing back, with Brunswick-Bevern vigilantly waiting on him, has continued ever since; diligently recruiting himself; ranking the remains of the right wing defeated at Prag; drawing regiments out of Mahren, or whencesoever to be had.

The anonymous author was probably a male Jew, standing on the margin between traditional and non-traditional Jewish values, and familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture being debated in his time. Writing in a polished Semitic \"synagogue Greek\", he drew on three main sources: the Gospel of Mark, the hypothetical collection of sayings known as the Q source, and material unique to his own community, called the M source or \"Special Matthew\". \n\nThe divine nature of Jesus was a major issue for the Matthaean community, the crucial element marking them from their Jewish neighbors; while Mark begins with baptism and transfiguration, Matthew goes back further still, showing Jesus as the Son of God from his birth, the fulfillment of Old Testament messianic prophecies. The title Son of David identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles), sent to Israel alone.

She told no secrets; but a hint was sufficient; for Mrs Amy guarded her daughter as a pearl of great price, and at once devised a very simple means of escape from danger. Mr Laurie was going to Washington on Dan's behalf, and was delighted to take his family with him when the idea was carelessly suggested. So the conspiracy succeeded finely; and Mrs Jo went home, feeling more like a traitor than ever. She expected an explosion; but Dan took the news so quietly, it was plain that he cherished no hope; and Mrs Amy was sure her romantic sister had been mistaken. If she had seen Dan's face when Bess went to say good-bye, her maternal eye would have discovered far more than the unconscious girl did. Mrs Jo trembled lest he should betray himself; but he had learned self-control in a stern school, and would have got through the hard moment bravely, only, when he took both hands, saying heartily: \n\n'Good-bye, Princess. If we don't meet again, remember your old friend Dan sometimes,' she, touched by his late danger and the wistful look he wore, answered with unusual warmth: 'How can I help it, when you make us all so proud of you?

His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians. \n\nFor the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \"This is the job for you.\" \n\nDrawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq. \n\nThis is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern.

Whether typing on computers or texting on phones, most users in China type by phonetically spelling out the sounds of the characters and the software then gives a menu of characters that fit the pronunciation, so users only need to recognize the character. \n\nHandwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years and became popular with the iPhone, which recognizes the input and offers a wide selection of characters. \n\n\"It's efficient and accurate,\" Yin says. \n\nChinese characters are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world, but as pinyin-based typing has become more widespread, youths have started forgetting how to write out characters. This was one of the main topics for debate at the first Cross-Straits Chinese Character Art Festival, held recently in Beijing, which attracted experts from Taiwan and the mainland. \n\nAccording to Zhang Zikang, president of the Culture and Art Publishing House, writing with a pen on the touch screen brings handwriting into the digital age. It is even better when you write with your finger, feeling the flow of the cursive script and the grace and art of Chinese characters, he says. \n\n\"Smart gadgets don't take life from the square-shaped characters, instead they offer a new and advanced platform to show the charm of Chinese characters, which are always evolving,\" Zhang says.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is like a pen?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who are fogetting how to draw letters?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is helping to change that?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is the name of a purchasing agent?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How old is he?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How long has handwriting ability been available on phones?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which phone made it popular?", "turn_id": 8}], "answers": [{"span_start": 517, "span_end": 527, "span_text": "your finge", "input_text": "your finge", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 3, "span_end": 16, "span_text": "young Chinese", "input_text": "young Chinese", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 69, "span_end": 149, "span_text": "they don't have to, using keyboards and touch screen technology on mobile phones", "input_text": "they don't have to, using keyboards and touch screen technology on mobile phones", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 343, "span_end": 387, "span_text": "the handwriting input method on his iPhone 4", "input_text": "the handwriting input method on his iPhone 4", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 179, "span_end": 188, "span_text": "Yin Liang", "input_text": "Yin Liang", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 192, "span_end": 194, "span_text": "26", "input_text": "26", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 909, "span_end": 988, "span_text": "Handwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years", "input_text": "Handwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 999, "span_end": 1023, "span_text": " popular with the iPhone", "input_text": "popular with the iPhone", "turn_id": 8}], "name": "high17801.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3jaoywh7vi4sycf1n9zvglyzryu9lr", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/R M Ballantyne___In the Track of the Troops.txt/CHAPTER TWENTY_0107aa1202bc06c8411fa9e9dfd5858279ed9ed3323b436c5c4426e", "story": "CHAPTER TWENTY ONE. \n\nMORE OF THE RESULTS OF WAR. \n\nI need not trouble the reader with an account of the meeting with my faithful servant.

It was very dark, but Petroff knew every foot of the country. For several hours we rode at a smart gallop, and then, as day was breaking, drew near to Venilik. As we approached, I observed that the bold countenance of the scout became almost pinched-looking from anxiety.

He said two other Afghans on the team are alive. \n\nAqa Nwor Kentoz, the police chief in the province, says the gunmen stopped the group on the road, took their belongings and shot them one by one. An Afghan was released because he was reciting excerpts from the Quran, Kentoz said. \n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. \n\nLibby Little, the wife of team leader Tom Little, confirmed to CNN that her husband was among the six Americans killed. \n\nSpeaking from her home in Delmar, New York, Little said she knew the worst had happened when she didn't hear from her husband after 24 hours.

The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class. A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed as ethnolect, and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect. According to this definition, any variety of a language constitutes \"a dialect\", including any standard varieties. \n\nThe other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically cognate or related to the standard language, but not actually derived from it. In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \"dialect,\" as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, the \"dialects\" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves. For example, most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy, often colloquially referred to as Italian \"dialects,\" are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy. These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents. These variations on standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would more appropriately be called \"dialects\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \"dialect,\" as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.

Google, one of the biggest U.S. companies, is trying to find it out. The company has already found \"a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area\". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly. \"Color is a silent salesperson,\" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company. Smaller companies are also realizing the importance of color. But picking the right color is important. \"You know when something is right because you get a feeling of safety, and it's not something that you think about. It just will hit you,\" said Emil Hagopian, a distributor for Mar Plast Color Building Accessories in Ann Arbor, Mich. \"And sometimes, if it's done wrong, that also hits you.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "who is Elyria?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is she following", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "what is she studying?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "how long does it take people to evaluate according to her?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "how much are companies spending on research?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "who is orange?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What color is Tiffany and Co", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who chose that color?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "how long does coca cola", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What was it shipped in?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "when did tiffany's annual collection come out?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what does it consist of?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "who is Joclyn?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "what does she say is responsible for their success", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "where is elyria a professor?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "what is her job there?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who found a connection between color and satisfaction?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what country are they a big company in?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "who is their spokeswoman?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "what world is color important in?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 333, "span_end": 411, "span_text": " She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans.

It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea). \n\nKorea emerged as a singular political entity after centuries of conflict among the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which were unified as Later Silla to the south and Balhae to the north. Later Silla divided into three separate states during the Later Three Kingdoms period. Goryeo, which had succeeded Goguryeo, defeated the two other states and united the Korean Peninsula. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as \"Kory\u014f\"), whose name developed into the modern exonym \"Korea\", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. However, multiple invasions by the Mongol Yuan Dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting.

We've seen it time and time again. Here's how it works: \n\nStep One: Republicans, with nothing in their arsenal to use against Hillary Clinton, selectively leak to reporters a \"scandalous\" tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported. \n\nStep Two: The new media bites. \n\nStep Three: The media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story. \n\nStep Four: Upon further examination, the story falls apart. \n\nThis is exactly how the latest media hype, this time over Hillary Clinton's use of emails at the State Department, has played out. And it presents yet another chapter in the Benghazi hoax. \n\nThe New York Times story about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account at the State Department is a perfect example of \"gotcha\" journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting. The New York Times has a history of this. (Whitewater, anyone?) \n\nThe Times story suggests Secretary Clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email. But the Times' main source for this allegation says Clinton violated no laws. \n\nYes, Clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state. But so did secretaries of state before her. According to the State Department spokesman Marie Harf, John Kerry is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official State Department email. \n\nClinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know \n\nIn October 2014, 18 months after Clinton left, the State Department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies. The State Department asked every secretary of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide records, including emails, from their time in office. Clinton responded to the State Department's request for emails, providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails. She did so months ago. Clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the State Department for these emails to be made public.

They were called \"cartoffs\" and \"knockouts.\" \n\nIn addition, it was alleged that the Saints offered a bounty for injuring Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre during the NFC Championship game in January 2010. \n\nIn October, after he upheld suspensions, Goodell appointed Tagliabue to review player appeals. \n\nIn his 18-page order, Tagliabue found that Fujita's actions \"were not conduct detrimental\" and vacated a one-game suspension imposed by Goodell. \n\nTagliabue wrote that Fujita \"did not participate in the program including cartoffs and knockouts and that his participation in a 'non-injury' pay-for-performance pool is typically subject only to club discipline.\" \n\nTagliabue found that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma engaged in \"conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football,\" but ordered their punishments also be rescinded. \n\nRead Tagliabue's ruling (PDF) \n\nHargrove had been suspended for seven games but was credited with having served five. Goodell found that Hargrove falsely answered an NFL investigator's questions about the misconduct. \n\nBut Tagliabue said it was not clear Hargrove lied about the program and noted that he was \"under tremendous pressure to follow the chain of command in order to keep his job.\" Tagliabue concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Hargrove's alleged misconduct merited a suspension.

She said Hinckley does regularly talk with a female neighbor of his mother, and with both his female supervisor and a female co-worker at his volunteer part-time job at a hospital library. \n\nGiorgi-Guarnieri said Hinckley, who likes to paint, has given paintings to both his supervisor and the co-worker. But she said that is something that is not unusual at that mental health care facility. \n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Hinckley also offered her a painting for her office but she declined, saying she already has enough artwork. \n\n\"He doesn't have a romantic relationship in Williamsburg,\" Giorgi-Guarnieri added. \n\nHinckley's relationships with women have always drawn scrutiny because he hoped to impress actress Jodie Foster with his attack on Reagan. \n\nHinckley, 56, currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in Williamsburg. A plan proposed by St. Elizabeths Hospital, where Hinckley has been treated since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of President Ronald Reagan and three other men, calls for the visits to be expanded and, if no problems develop, for Hinckley's eventual release to live as an outpatient.

The Shia believe that the Imams are the true Caliphs or rightful successors of Muhammad, and further that Imams are possessed of divine knowledge and authority (Ismah) as well as being part of the Ahl al-Bayt, the family of Muhammad. These Imams have the role of providing commentary and interpretation of the Quran as well as guidance to their tariqa followers as is the case of the living Imams of the Nizari Ismaili tariqah. \n\nShias believe that Imamah is of the Principles of Faith (Usul al-Din).As the verse 4:165 of quran expresses the necessity to the appointment of the prophets; so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet; till the people have not any plea against Allah.So the same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for Imamah.That is Allah Must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion.

The idea was to help students understand how technology has affected their lives, said Denise Uhl, principal of the school. Uhl did a survey on technology usage among the eighth-graders before thinking of the challenge. She found that 84 percent of the students said they didn't like it \"when everyone was on their cell phones\", but they didn't know what to do about it. The answer was actually easy --- to stop constantly using cell phones. To help students understand the point, Uhl created the activity. It was warmly welcomed among students. \"I wanted to sign up for the tech-free challenge because it was just really a good idea to do it,\" eighth-grader Joe told local newspaper Catholic San Francisco. \"I wanted to get closer to my family. And it really worked. I started to hang out with my family more. We watched more family movies and we played a lot of board games.\" The activity also helped students develop their interests.

Gbagbo is also tracking down Ouattara backers on social networks and chat rooms, Mallet said. \n\nThe Young Patriots are run by Charles Ble Goude, Gbagbo's minister of youth.

He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster. After that, on the coldest day of winter, people beat drums and gongs, and set off fireworks to celebrate the death of the monster of Nian.

For many of them, a summer or a semester in a foreign country now involves more than just sitting in classrooms and hanging out with other American students. Instead, they are encouraged and sometimes required to be involved in the local communities they are studying in. \n\n\"It's ly important that they know something about how people in other parts of the world live and think, and how they behave,\" says William Finlay, head of the sociology department at the University of Georgia. In 2008, he co-founded a study abroad program with South Africa's Stellenbosch University. It combines traditional academic in-class learning with community involvement. \n\n\"We've been working with a non-government organization in the township. Our students typically either work with little children in day care centers or work in the library and teach very basic computer skills to young children,\" says Finlay. \n\nThe three-week program proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hillary Kinsey. She says, \"It was interesting to learn the history of the area and then talk to these people and see what the social dynamics were, and how certain groups felt about other groups.\" \n\nWhen Hillary Kinsey returned home from South Africa, she and other students in the program established a non-profit group. Kinsey says the group wants to contribute to advancing education and development in South Africa. \"One of the purposes of the group is that we hope to raise money and awareness about the situation where those people live and help to promote any sort of educational development that we can, \" Kinsey added. \n\nWhile many study abroad programs focus on helping Americans to learn foreign languages, others take a more intensive approach. \"In all of our locations, we place students with local roommates,\" says Mark Lenhart, director of CEF Academic Programs, which sends more than a thousand students to China, Korea and other countries each year. \n\nHe says American students benefit from such one-on-one interactions, in spite of the challenges they face.

Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \"kingdom\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. \n\nWhen Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In the 1960s a rank was introduced above kingdom, namely domain (or empire), so that kingdom is no longer the highest rank. \n\nPrefixes can be added so \"subkingdom\" (\"subregnum\") and \"infrakingdom\" (also known as \"infraregnum\") are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank \"branch\" (Latin: \"ramus\") can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom (e.g. Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith).", "questions": [{"input_text": "Which rank is this article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is above it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And below it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many kingdoms does the US recognize?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And elsewhere?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How many kingdoms do they agree on?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Which ones are those?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What kingdoms does the US have that the others don't?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And which ones do others have that the US doesn't?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who created this system?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What science is this part of?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was kingdom the highest rank at first?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Is it still?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What's another name for domain?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Originally how many ranks were below kingdom?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What were they?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Is it still like that?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What happened?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 106, "span_text": "In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain.", "input_text": "Kingdom", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 105, "span_text": "In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain", "input_text": "domain", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 107, "span_end": 161, "span_text": "Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla.", "input_text": "phyla", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 161, "span_end": 245, "span_text": " Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms ", "input_text": "Six", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 163, "span_end": 485, "span_text": "raditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera).", "input_text": "Five", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 244, "span_end": 485, "span_text": " (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera).", "input_text": "Four", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 246, "span_end": 282, "span_text": "Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, ", "input_text": "Animalia, Plantae, Fungi and Protista", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 162, "span_end": 330, "span_text": "Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria", "input_text": "Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 398, "span_end": 483, "span_text": "and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera", "input_text": "Monera", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 714, "span_end": 806, "span_text": "When Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735,", "input_text": "Carolus Linnaeus", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 713, "span_end": 805, "span_text": "\nWhen Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735", "input_text": "1735", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 87, "span_text": "In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank,", "input_text": "biology", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 714, "span_end": 853, "span_text": "When Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 107, "span_text": "In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain.

It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew . And the earliest needles were made from bones. Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency. \n\nCharles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection. \n\nFrenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine. \n\nAmerican inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines. \n\nIsaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines. He invented an up-and-down-motion mechanism that replaced the side-to-side machines. He also developed a foot treadle to power his machine. This improvement left the sewer's hands free. Undoubtedly, it was a huge improvement of the hand-cranked machine of the past. Soon the Singer sewing machine achieved more fame than the others for it was more practical. It could be adapted to home use and it could be bought on hire-purchase. The Singer sewing machine became the first home appliance, and the Singer company became one of the first American multinationals. \n\nHowever, Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented. As a result, Howe accused him of patent infringement . Of course, Elias Howe won the court case, and Singer was ordered to pay Howe royalties . In the end, Howe became a millionaire, not by manufacturing the sewing machine, but by receiving royalty payments for his invention.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the first thread made from?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What about the needles?", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 48, "span_end": 120, "span_text": " It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew", "input_text": "It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 122, "span_end": 168, "span_text": " And the earliest needles were made from bones", "input_text": "And the earliest needles were made from bones", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "high4405.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3nc5l260mom9579b3nffiyo4pu3fo1", "filename": "high20826.txt", "story": "Marjorie Gestring \n\nMarjorie Gestring was a springboard diver from the United States who won the gold medal in 3-meter springboard diving at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany at the age of 13 years.

Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence. This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like (as in \"less\"), non-lateral approximants like (as in \"rest\"), and semivowels like and (as in \"yes\" and \"west\", respectively). \n\nBefore Peter Ladefoged coined the term \"approximant\" in the 1960s, the term \"frictionless continuant\" referred to non-lateral approximants. \n\nSome approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms \"semivowel\" and \"glide\" are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels. \n\nVowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with Indo-European ablaut. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel. A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, remarks that, for example, the final glides of English \"par\" and \"buy\" differ from French \"par\" ('through') and \"baille\" ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the syllable coda, whereas, in the former, they appear in the syllable nucleus. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like Italian (with the i-like sound of \"piede\" 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: , and that of \"piano\" 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: ) and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being \"abyecto\" 'abject' and \"abierto\" 'opened').", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who came up with the term approximant?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What word was used before that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What did that represent?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Are they fricatives?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What speech sound makes no turbulence?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do languages frequently avoid?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What does location within a syllable help distinguish?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Can Italian have opaque contrasts?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What about Spanish?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 490, "span_end": 543, "span_text": "Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term \"approximant\" ", "input_text": "Peter Ladefoged", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 490, "span_end": 556, "span_text": "Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term \"approximant\" in the 1960s,", "input_text": "in the 1960s,", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 557, "span_end": 630, "span_text": "the term \"frictionless continuant\" referred to non-lateral approximants.

Atlantic City was incorporated on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township. The city borders Absecon, Brigantine, Pleasantville, Ventnor City and West Atlantic City. \n\nBecause of its location in South Jersey, hugging the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was viewed by developers as prime real estate and a potential resort town. In 1853, the first commercial hotel, The Belloe House, located at Massachusetts and Atlantic Avenue, was built. \n\nThe city was incorporated in 1854, the same year in which the Camden and Atlantic Railroad train service began. Built on the edge of the bay, this served as the direct link of this remote parcel of land with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

To take off the pounds, Hanks ate little and exercised a lot. \n\nThe movie may surprise some of Hank's fans. It's not an upbeat comedy like Sleepless in Seattle or You're Got Mail.

Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming. \n\nThe weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday, when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming data, is readily available on a real-time basis, and is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday). A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by \"Billboard\" on Tuesdays. Example: \n\nThe first number one song of the Hot 100 was \"Poor Little Fool\" by Ricky Nelson, on August 4, 1958. As of the issue for the week ending on October 7, 2017, the Hot 100 has had 1,067 different number one hits. The current number one song is \"Bodak Yellow\" by Cardi B. \n\nPrior to 1955, \"Billboard\" did not have a unified, all-encompassing popularity chart, instead measuring songs by individual metrics.

On the week ending November 12, 1955, \"Billboard\" published The Top 100 for the first time. \"The Top 100\" combined all aspects of a single's performance (sales, airplay and jukebox activity), based on a point system that typically gave sales (purchases) more weight than radio airplay.

February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday. Yet for many, his language is old-fashioned and his stories often improbable. So why do so many people know and read Dickens today? \n\nOne reason is the British government's insistence that every child studies a Dickens novel at school. Alongside William Shakespeare, Dickens is on every English literature school reading list. \n\nHis stories, though often long by today's standards, are great moral tales. They are filled with colorful characters. \n\nEarlier this month, a ceremony was held in Portsmouth, where Dickens was born. Prince Charles said at the ceremony, \"Dickens used his creative genius to campaign passionately for social justice... His characterization is as fresh today as on the day it was written.\" \n\nHis books stand out from many other writers because of his insight into human nature. Dickens, like Shakespeare, tells us truths about human behavior. They are as true in the 21st century as they were to his readers in the 19th century. \n\nReaders have returned to Dickens' books again and again over the years to see what he has to say about their own times. \n\nNo surprise then that it was Dickens whom Britons turned to during the economic crisis in the last couple of years. Dickens helped them make sense of a world that was rapidly falling apart. The BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit, into a popular television drama that introduced many Brits to the novel for the first time. A dark story about greed and money, it was the perfect illustration of bad times. \n\nAs long as Dickens's novels have something to say to modern audiences, it seems likely that he will remain one of Britain's best-loved writers.", "questions": [{"input_text": "who is the story about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "was he alive 300 years ago?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Was his birth in the month that follows January?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "on what day?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "where was he born?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "what happened there recently?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "did anyone prominent attend?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "who?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "was one of his works mentioned?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "which one?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "does it have an upbeat plot?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "what is it about?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "has it recently been reinterpreted?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "in what medium?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "was it a dark comedy?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "what was it?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "where is the Dickens from?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 16, "span_text": "Charles Dickens ", "input_text": "Charles Dickens", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 76, "span_end": 131, "span_text": "February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 76, "span_end": 132, "span_text": "February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 76, "span_end": 131, "span_text": "February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday", "input_text": "the 7th", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 624, "span_end": 659, "span_text": " Portsmouth, where Dickens was born", "input_text": "Portsmouth", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 601, "span_end": 635, "span_text": " a ceremony was held in Portsmouth", "input_text": "a ceremony was held", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 661, "span_end": 696, "span_text": "Prince Charles said at the ceremony", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 661, "span_end": 696, "span_text": "Prince Charles said at the ceremony", "input_text": "Prince Charles", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1434, "span_end": 1467, "span_text": "well-known novels, Little Dorrit,", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1424, "span_end": 1466, "span_text": " his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit", "input_text": "Little Dorrit", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1559, "span_end": 1573, "span_text": " A dark story ", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1559, "span_end": 1594, "span_text": " A dark story about greed and money", "input_text": "greed and money", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1406, "span_end": 1451, "span_text": "BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1406, "span_end": 1467, "span_text": "BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit,", "input_text": "The BBC", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1453, "span_end": 1493, "span_text": "Little Dorrit, into a popular television", "input_text": "television", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1453, "span_end": 1499, "span_text": "Little Dorrit, into a popular television drama", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1472, "span_end": 1499, "span_text": " a popular television drama", "input_text": "a drama", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 68, "span_text": "Charles Dickens is often thought of as one of the greatest British w", "input_text": "England", "turn_id": 18}], "name": "high9864.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3r3yrb5grf39mlc0ot5w3352aahauj", "filename": "middle2867.txt", "story": "We have two daughters: Kristen is seven years old and Kelly is four.Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner.I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang.Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom.

Hannah followed my example. \"Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?\" \n\nShe stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed.

It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries. It is currently maintained by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries. OCLC licenses access to an online version for catalogers called \"WebDewey\". \n\nThe Decimal Classification introduced the concepts of \"relative location\" and \"relative index\" which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who published the DDC?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Is DDC an acronym?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What does it stand for?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Is it called anything else?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What concepts were introduced with this program?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What criteria did it use to put the books in a location?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What type of numerals did it use for main classes of books?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "2 digit?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Were fractional decimals used as well?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did this allow expansion for?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was the use of numerals rigid?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How was its use described?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many editions have there been?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When was the last released?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many pages did it originally have?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who maintains the DDC now?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Are they a private, for profit company?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 112, "span_end": 171, "span_text": "first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 187", "input_text": "Melvil Dewey", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1, "span_end": 172, "span_text": "he Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), or Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876", "input_text": "1876", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 112, "span_end": 172, "span_text": "first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876", "input_text": "the United States", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), ", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), ", "input_text": "Dewey Decimal Classification", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 66, "span_text": "The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), or Dewey Decimal System, i", "input_text": "Dewey Decimal System", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 585, "span_end": 679, "span_text": "The Decimal Classification introduced the concepts of \"relative location\" and \"relative index\"", "input_text": "\"relative location\" and \"relative index\"", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 680, "span_end": 774, "span_text": "which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject.", "input_text": "subject", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 903, "span_end": 974, "span_text": "The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals ", "input_text": "Arabic", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 991, "span_text": "three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 946, "span_end": 991, "span_text": "three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes,", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 991, "span_end": 1055, "span_text": " with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 991, "span_end": 1055, "span_text": " with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail.", "input_text": "further detail.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1056, "span_end": 1107, "span_text": "Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible t", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1090, "span_end": 1105, "span_text": " it is flexible", "input_text": "it is flexible", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 173, "span_end": 234, "span_text": " It has been revised and expanded through 23 major editions, ", "input_text": "23", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 233, "span_end": 260, "span_text": " the latest issued in 2011,", "input_text": "2011,", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 279, "span_end": 308, "span_text": " a four-page pamphlet in 1876", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 385, "span_end": 457, "span_text": " It is currently maintained by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)", "input_text": "OCLC", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 450, "span_end": 507, "span_text": " (OCLC), a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries.

Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Do pets always like their owner's babies immediately?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did the Pomeranian do to  the baby's belongings?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why did he do that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How can you exclude animals from baby's area?", "turn_id": 4}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 71, "span_text": "When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. \n", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 271, "span_end": 377, "span_text": " But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them", "input_text": "peed on them", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 428, "span_end": 483, "span_text": " Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby.

The cracks just cut deeper. I've rarely experienced an audience recoil from a character as passionately as they did to Nicole Kidman's toxically self-absorbed writer in \"Margot at the Wedding\" (maybe her best performance, incidentally). These are comedies in the sense that the characters are painfully ridiculous -- and all too recognizably real -- but Baumbach sure doesn't make it easy for himself, or us. \n\nRoger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) is another neurotic narcissist, a middle-aged loner who comes back to Los Angeles to house-sit while his brother enjoys a long vacation in the Far East.

Zane, his brother Jonathan, the negro Sam, and Martin Wetzel, all within the Fort. Col. Zane had determined, long before, that in the event of another siege, he would use his house as an outpost. Twice it had been destroyed by fire at the hands of the Indians. Therefore, surrounding himself by these men, who were all expert marksmen, Col. Zane resolved to protect his property and at the same time render valuable aid to the Fort. \n\nEarly that morning a pirogue loaded with cannon balls, from Ft. Pitt and bound for Louisville, had arrived and Captain Sullivan, with his crew of three men, had demanded admittance. In the absence of Capt. Boggs and Major McColloch, both of whom had been dispatched for reinforcements, Col. Zane had placed his brother Silas in command of the Fort. Sullivan informed Silas that he and his men had been fired on by Indians and that they sought the protection of the Fort. The services of himself and men, which he volunteered, were gratefully accepted. \n\nAll told, the little force in the block-house did not exceed forty-two, and that counting the boys and the women who could handle rifles. The few preparations had been completed and now the settlers were awaiting the appearance of the enemy. Few words were spoken.

His other acceptances came from Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stony Brook University and Vanderbilt University. \n\n\"We are so proud of him, \" said his mother , Roseline Ekeh.\"Hard work, dedication, prayer brought him to where he is today. \" \n\nBorn in Nigeria, Harold was eight years old when his parents brought the family to the United States. \n\n\"It was kind of difficult adjusting to the new environment and the new culture, \" he said. But he saw his parents working hard, \"and I took their example and decides to _ \n\nHe referenced that effort in his college essay, writing, \"Like a tree, uprooted and replanted, I could have withered in a new country surrounded by people and languages I did not understand. Yet, I witnessed my parents persevere despite the potential to give in. I faced my challenges with newfound zeal; I risked insults, spending my break talking to unfamiliar faces, ignoring their sarcastic remarks. \" \n\nHarold \"is tremendously focused in everything he does.\" said John Capozzi, the school's principal, \"He's a great role model. All the students and faculty are so proud of him. \" \n\nHarold is the second Long Island student in as many years to get into all eight Ivies. Last year, William Floyd High School's Kwasi Enim chose to go to Yale. \n\nHarold, who has a 100. 51 grade-point average and wants to be a neurosurgeon, said he was leaning toward Yale, and had heard from Enin, offering congratulations. Like Enin, he's likely to announce his college choice at a press conference later this month.

She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, but only for one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. The people with whom she did come in contact, however, had an enormous impact on her poetry. She was particularly stirred by the Reverend Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia. While it is certain that he was an important figure in her life, it is not clear that their relationship was romantic--she called him \"my closest earthly friend.\" By the 1860s, Dickinson lived in almost complete isolation from the outside world, but actively maintained many correspondences and read widely. She spent a great deal of this time with her family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for one term. Her brother, Austin, who attended law school and became an attorney , lived next door with his wife, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson's younger sister, Lavinia, also lived at home for her entire life in similar isolation. Lavinia and Austin were not only family, but intellectual companions for Dickinson during her lifetime. While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary techniques, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is this story about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was her best friend?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who did she meet on a trip to Philadelphia", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where was Emily born?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What day?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Of what year?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Was her father a politician?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How long did he serve in Congress?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the subject of most of her poems?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When was her first collection of poetry published?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 16, "span_text": "Emily Dickinson ", "input_text": "Emily Dickinson", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 364, "span_end": 381, "span_text": "Charles Wadsworth", "input_text": "Charles Wadsworth", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 364, "span_end": 427, "span_text": "Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia", "input_text": "Charles Wadsworth", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 20, "span_end": 72, "span_text": "born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts", "input_text": "Amherst, Massachusetts", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 28, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "December 10", "input_text": "December 10", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 41, "span_end": 45, "span_text": "1830", "input_text": "1830", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 802, "span_end": 872, "span_text": "Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 790, "span_end": 818, "span_text": "Her father, Edward Dickinson", "input_text": "Edward Dickinson", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 885, "span_end": 906, "span_text": "Congress for one term", "input_text": "one term", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1569, "span_end": 1617, "span_text": "poems deal with themes of death and immortality,", "input_text": "death and immortality,", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1670, "span_end": 1718, "span_text": "first collection of poetry was published in 1890", "input_text": "1890", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high18046.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3spj033421314nz9s0fyzneywldyjc", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Edward Stratemeyer___Dave Porter at Star Ranch.txt/CHAPTER VII_17cee87adb89ff973b994b9707c4efa0663070af0aac0693deacc58", "story": "CHAPTER VII \n\nIN WHICH DAVE IS ROBBED \n\nDave found himself in a decidedly unpleasant situation.

Perhaps. But it's all for a good cause. \n\nCook has volunteered, through the online-auction site Charity Buzz, to share up to an hour of his precious time with two lucky (and deep-pocketed) winners. Proceeds from the auction will go to The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights, an international nonprofit founded as a memorial to Robert F. Kennedy by his family and friends. \n\nIn the auction's first day, Cook had gotten 52 bids, starting at $5,000 and spiraling upward quickly. The leading bid Thursday evening was $210,000, and there were still 19 days to go until bidding closes May 14. \n\nThe coffee chat will happen at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. The winner may bring along one guest. \n\nThe move fits in with the more open public persona Cook has adopted since replacing late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs. One of the knocks on Jobs was that he never contributed much of his considerable fortune, or celebrity, to charity -- at least not in the public ways other tech titans like Microsoft's Bill Gates and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg have. \n\nBy some measures, a $180,000 coffee meeting with the chief of the world's leading tech company might be a bargain. An anonymous bidder paid $3.4 million last year for lunch with investor Warren Buffett.

In 1889, Sullivan defeated Jade Kilrain with his bare fists in another championship fight, winning twenty thousand dollars and a diamond prize medal.

A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again.

All her old men had been only too glad of the opportunity to come back to her, and under Dale and Roy Beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch. \n\nHelen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of rooms and adding a new section. Only once had she ventured into the old dining-room where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner for Beasley. She made a store-room of it, and a place she would never again enter. \n\nHelen was happy, almost too happy, she thought, and therefore made more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of life. Carmichael had ridden out of Pine, ostensibly on the trail of the Mexicans who had executed Beasley's commands. The last seen of him had been reported from Show Down, where he had appeared red-eyed and dangerous, like a hound on a scent. Then two months had flown by without a word. \n\nDale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's absence. It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again. Also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his drunken, savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by his friends.

These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct a biological \"tree of life\" based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils. The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilised multicellular organisms.

Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

He passed secrets in exchange for hefty payments from December 2001 to February 2004, said the spy chief, Alberto Saiz, head of the National Intelligence Agency (known by its Spanish initials CNI). \n\nSaiz, at a news conference, refused to publicly identify the recipient country, but Spain's SER Radio, said it was Russia, citing unnamed sources. \n\nFlores, a Spanish Civil Guard assigned to spy agency headquarters for internal matters, had been a suspect under surveillance by Spanish intelligence since July 2005, said Saiz. \n\nFlores resigned from his position at the spy agency in January 2004, Saiz said. \n\nSaiz insisted that Spain's national security was never threatened, nor, he said, was there a threat to security at NATO and the European Union. Spain is a member country of both organizations. \n\nBut Saiz said the alleged revelations of the suspected double agent forced Spain to substitute a number of its spies. \n\nThe suspect allegedly revealed the names of dozens of Spanish spies, possibly including the seven Spanish spies killed in an ambush south of Baghdad in November 2003, Saiz said. \n\nAn eighth Spanish intelligence agent traveling with them survived. The eight spies, were in Iraq to provide intelligence for Spanish troops who were stationed at the time in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led coalition. The spies were traveling in two vehicles when insurgents launched an ambush with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades.

Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped . \n\nPerri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature. \n\nA child of the Depression , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes. \n\nEach writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork.

Their time on these things has increased, yet they need to have time to think about their experiences through play or just watching the world around them. It is this kind of thinking that can inspire the imagination. On the other hand, the TV or phone may cut short the thinking process.

She signed up at the last minute and didn't even practice, thinking, \"All they could do was to tell me no, and that didn't hurt my feelings anymore.\" She had the strength she needed to fall back on if she failed. \n\nShe won. But making it in New York was just the beginning. It took her three more years to become an understudy at the Met. But waiting in the wings was fine with her. Finally, her time came. When the featured singer fell ill, Brown earned the chance to sing the lead role in Aida. And The New York Times described her performance as a great success.

When Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father Hafez Assad in 2000, there was the promise of a modern and more democratic Syria. \n\nIn his inauguration speech, al-Assad indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father. \"I shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfils the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people,\" he said. \n\nAnd for a while that promise was kept. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. He has also worked on social and economic reform. \n\nBut while there have been some changes during his rule, many say al-Assad's promises have largely not been delivered. \n\nHuman Rights Watch has called his time as president \"the wasted decade\" with a media that remains controlled by the state, a monitored and censored internet and prisons still filled with dissidents. \n\nTwo former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- recalled their time with the younger al-Assad. Former vice president Abdel Halim Khaddam said Bashar was often the victim of his elder brother's cruelty. \"His brother Basil bullied him as a child.

But Florence, though she was unhappy, was not even yet jealous. Her fears did not lie in that direction, nor had she naturally any tendency to such uneasiness. He was ill, she thought; or if not ill in health, then ill at ease. Some trouble afflicted him of which he could not bring himself to tell her the facts, and as she thought of this she remembered her own stubbornness on the subject of their marriage, and blamed herself in that she was not now with him, to comfort him. If such comfort would avail him anything now, she would be stubborn no longer. When the third letter brought no reply she wrote to her sister-in-law, Mrs. Burton, confessing her uneasiness, and begging for comfort.

It is the story of a young boy named Pi who spends 227 days at sea with a small group of animals after disaster strikes their ship and is an account of his journey of survival and hardship. \n\nPiscine \"Pi\" Molitor Patel, on whom Life of Pi is based, is a young boy living in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home. \n\nHowever, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan , an injured zebra, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now. \n\nIn an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive. \n\nThe life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone.
