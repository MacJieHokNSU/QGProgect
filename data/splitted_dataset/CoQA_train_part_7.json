"Rome (CNN) -- Italian center-left politician Enrico Letta has fully accepted a mandate to form a government, he told reporters Saturday. \n\nLetta made the announcement after meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano, who had given him that mandate on Wednesday. \n\nThe 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers will be sworn in on Sunday at 11:30 a.m., the presidential palace said. \n\nParliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence on Monday. \n\nLetta's acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February, when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. \n\nHe gave reporters a list of his 18 ministers, two of whom are members of the center-right People of Freedom Party led by three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. \n\nThree of the ministers are holdovers from the government of Mario Monti, the outgoing prime minister. \n\nNearly all the others are members of Letta's Democratic Party or people close to it. \n\nLetta had accepted Napolitano's request to take the job with reservations \n\nNapolitano, 87, was re-elected by Italy's Parliament on Saturday to an unprecedented second term as president. \n\nFebruary's general election resulted in a three-way split among the right, the left and a wild-card

In contrast, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE, based its \"mind-only\" idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience.

Wellington himself said, \"This was one of the most glorious actions British troops were ever engaged in.\" \n\nThe next day the French crossed the Coa and Turones, and took up their position under the guns of Ciudad Rodrigo, which they had left six months before with the full assurance that they were going to conquer Portugal, and drive the British into the sea.

Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a prepared statement. \n\n\"Increasing the sale age to 21 will reduce tobacco use among youth and young adults, age groups when nearly all smoking begins and that are heavily targeted by the tobacco industry,\" he said. \n\nIt was not clear Monday whether Ige would sign the bill, although on Friday he approved legislation banning the the use of e-cigarettes in all locations where smoking is illegal. A spokeswoman for the governor told CNN in an email that he would need some time to review the bill. \n\nThe legislation comes after a report last month from the Institute of Medicine that said barring people under age 21 from buying cigarettes would have significant public health benefits. Setting the minimum age at 21 nationwide would result in nearly a quarter-million fewer premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among people born between 2000 and 2019, the report estimated.

On the previous day, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, resigned, declared his office extinct, and handed over its powers \u2013 including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes \u2013 to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32 p.m., the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag. \n\nMikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11, 1985, three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko's death at age 73. Gorbachev, aged 54, was the youngest member of the Politburo. His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy, and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures.

Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar, the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital transferred to Kandahar. It held control of most of the country until being overthrown by the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks.

It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper \"Variability and Mutability\" (). \n\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example, levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people, where only one person has all the income or consumption, and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be very nearly one). However, a value greater than one may occur if some persons represent negative contribution to the total (for example, having negative income or wealth). For larger groups, values close to or above 1 are very unlikely in practice. Given the normalization of both the cumulative population and the cumulative share of income used to calculate the Gini coefficient, the measure is not overly sensitive to the specifics of the income distribution, but rather only on how incomes vary relative to the other members of a population. The exception to this is in the redistribution of wealth resulting in a minimum income for all people.

Due to Lan Xang's central geographical location in Southeast Asia, the kingdom was able to become a popular hub for overland trade, becoming wealthy economically as well as culturally. \n\nAfter a period of internal conflict, Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms \u2014 Luang Phrabang, Vientiane, and Champasak. In 1893, it became a French protectorate, with the three territories uniting to form what is now known as the country of Laos.

He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.\" \n\nCompanion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences. I know that I held my adopted dog a little closer after hearing this story. There are a lot of dogs out there that need good homes and that won't be as lucky as Juno.

It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people.

Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment. \n\nThe first civilizations generally did not distinguish between civil law and criminal law. The first written codes of law were designed by the Sumerians. Around 2100\u20132050 BC Ur-Nammu, the Neo-Sumerian king of Ur, enacted the oldest written legal code whose text has been discovered: the \"Code of Ur-Nammu\" although an earlier code of Urukagina of Lagash ( 2380\u20132360 BC ) is also known to have existed. Another important early code was the Code Hammurabi, which formed the core of Babylonian law. Only fragments of the early criminal laws of Ancient Greece have survived, e.g. those of Solon and Draco. \n\nIn Roman law, Gaius's \"Commentaries on the Twelve Tables\" also conflated the civil and criminal aspects, treating theft (\"furtum\") as a tort. Assault and violent robbery were analogized to trespass as to property. Breach of such laws created an obligation of law or \"vinculum juris\" discharged by payment of monetary compensation or damages. The criminal law of imperial Rome is collected in Books 47\u201348 of the Digest.

The savage humors and the rankling desire for vengeance in the boldest of his subalterns, were made to quail before the menacing glances of an eye that seldom threatened without performance; nor was there one of them all, when challenged to come forth to brave the anger or to oppose the eloquence of his chief, who did not shrink from a contest which habitual respect had taught them to believe would be far too unequal for success.

Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. \n\nThe research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. \n\n\"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\" said Barnes. \"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\" \n\nPhone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\" \n\nThe co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. \"We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,\" Barnes says. \"It's been a great adventure.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How much bacteria can be on your phone?", "turn_id": 1}], "answers": [{"span_start": 207, "span_end": 280, "span_text": "18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom.", "input_text": "18 times more than any surface in a public restroom.", "turn_id": 1}], "name": "high13639.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3u5nzhp4lr2b43ciddguaj57e8ohph", "filename": "middle3174.txt", "story": "Canada is famous for its winter lifestyle, for the season lasts half the year there.

The Carnival has a magical ice palace made with 9,000 tons of snow, a boat race on the St. Lawrence River, and two night parades with funny people and colorful cars. Other interesting things include a 122-meter ice slide, and a large football game. There is also an exciting dogsled race that runs through six kilometers of the city's streets. With more than 20 teams in the game, the dogsled race is noisy, fun and full of great cheer. Even better, artists from around the world come to enter the snow sculpture competition.

Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9\u201323 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC \u2013 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25\u2013220 AD). \n\nThe emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu.

Whenever Hilt wasn't watching, she destroyed the family's furniture and possessions. \"Every day with Nina had become a struggle,\" she recalls now. \n\nAs the girl grew older, things got worse.

I felt this uncontrollable rage.\" \n\nThen Hilt did something unthinkable. She grabbed Nina around the neck, shook her and then dropped her to the floor, where she kicked her repeatedly before dragging her up to her room, punching her as they went. \"I had never hit a child before,\" she says. \"I felt horrible and promised myself that this would never happen again.\" But _ .

Dr. Paris took it. \"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\" he recalls. \"I'm lucky to be alive.\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. \n\nIn 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109.

They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside).

The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon; the Third Coalition (1805), the Fourth (1806\u20137), Fifth (1809), Sixth (1813), and the Seventh and final (1815). \n\nNapoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a chaotic republic; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, Austria and Russia waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British inflicted a severe defeat in October 1805 upon the joint Franco-Spanish navy, securing British control of the seas and preventing the invasion of Britain itself. Prussian concerns about increasing French power led to a resumption of war in October 1806.

Although Canberra is the capital and seat of government, many federal government ministries have secondary seats in state capital cities, as do the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. \n\nThe site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory. \n\nThe city's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers.

An example is the function that relates each real number \"x\" to its square \"x\". The output of a function \"f\" corresponding to an input \"x\" is denoted by \"f\"(\"x\") (read \"\"f\"\u00a0of\u00a0\"x\"\"). In this example, if the input is \u22123, then the output is 9, and we may write . Likewise, if the input is 3, then the output is also 9, and we may write . (The same output may be produced by more than one input, but each input gives only one output.) The input variable(s) are sometimes referred to as the argument(s) of the function. \n\nFunctions of various kinds are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most fields of modern mathematics. There are many ways to describe or represent a function. Some functions may be defined by a formula or algorithm that tells how to compute the output for a given input. Others are given by a picture, called the graph of the function. In science, functions are sometimes defined by a table that gives the outputs for selected inputs. A function could be described implicitly, for example as the inverse to another function or as a solution of a differential equation.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are functions?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Between what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What are different types of function in today's mathematics?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What sort of image could you use to describe them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How could a function's representation be implied?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Any other way?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What way is that?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How could a function be directly defined?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Can each input give many outputs?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Can an output give many inputs?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 16, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "a function is a relation", "input_text": "relations", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 16, "span_end": 98, "span_text": "a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs ", "input_text": "inputs and outputs", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 684, "span_end": 762, "span_text": "Functions of various kinds are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most ", "input_text": "the central objects of investigation", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 961, "span_end": 1024, "span_text": "Others are given by a picture, called the graph of the function", "input_text": "a graph", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1125, "span_end": 1214, "span_text": "A function could be described implicitly, for example as the inverse to another function ", "input_text": "as the inverse to another function", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1136, "span_end": 1257, "span_text": "could be described implicitly, for example as the inverse to another function or as a solution of a differential equation", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1136, "span_end": 1257, "span_text": "could be described implicitly, for example as the inverse to another function or as a solution of a differential equation", "input_text": "a solution of a differential equation", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1038, "span_end": 1123, "span_text": "functions are sometimes defined by a table that gives the outputs for selected inputs", "input_text": "by a table", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 120, "span_end": 165, "span_text": " each input is related to exactly one output.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 503, "span_end": 557, "span_text": "The same output may be produced by more than one input", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Function_(mathematics).txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "33f859i566d909b8u8ytfz0iy89bhz", "filename": "United_States_Air_ForceUnited_States_Air_Force_7a3466fd13a906ecee502c94b7758af4a2cb7e57cea279381f96e556", "story": "The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services.

For example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106. ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered an invisible graphic:223). \n\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.

But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. \n\nHe is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. \n\nHe's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \"SEALs Team 6\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. \n\nHe was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \"It's getting very scientific.\" \n\nMarcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \"He'll be ripped,\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \"Rogue Warrior.\"\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\" \n\nOn this point, Greitens departs a bit. \"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\" says the author of \"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. \n\nThe shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \"He's bearded, rough-looking, like a street naughty boy,\" Marcinko supposes. \"You don't want to stick out.\" Marcinko calls it \"modified grooming standards.\" \n\nHis hands will be calloused , Smith says, or just rough enough,\" as Marcinko puts it. And \"he's got frag in him somewhere,\" Marcinko says, using the battlefield shorthand for \"fragments\" of bullets or explosive devices. This will not have been the shooter's first adventure. Marcinko estimates that he might have made a dozen or more deployments , tours when he was likely to have dealt with quite a number of dangerous situations, getting ready any time for explosive devices or bullets.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who did the sniper kill?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How did he do it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where'd in the world did it happen?",

made in due form. \n\nSome days afterward Isaac learned that the spoils of war at this place were one hundred and twenty iron cannon, fifty swivels, two ten-inch mortars, one howitzer, one cohorn, ten tons musket-balls, three cartloads flints, thirty gun-carriages, a quantity of shells, a large amount of material for boat building, one hundred stand of small arms, ten casks of powder, two brass cannon, thirty barrels of flour and eighteen barrels of pork. \n\nForty-eight soldiers were surrendered and preparations were at once begun to send these, together with the women and children, to Hartford. \n\nHardly was the surrender made complete when such of the troops as had been left on the opposite shore under Seth Warner, arrived in a schooner, much to the surprise of all, until it was learned that Captain Herrick, who had been sent to Skenesborough to seize the son of the governor, had succeeded in his mission without bloodshed. \n\nHe took not only the young major, but twelve negroes and attendants, seized the schooner owned by the elder Skene, and had come down the lake in the early morning with the hope of aiding in the capture of Ticonderoga. \n\nIsaac had supposed this victory would end the adventure, and was saying to himself that his experience had been rather pleasing than otherwise, so much so in fact that he almost regretted the time was near at hand for him to

The whole building and everything in it are made of snow-except for the wooden front door. There's a theatre which Nils uses for a jazz club, a radio station and a large ice bar. As you can imagine, hot drinks are popular with the guests! The rooms have no doors; there's no furniture, no heating and everyone sleeps on ice beds. But the 800 people who stayed at the hotel this winter seemed to like it. If you want to stay in one of he ten ice rooms, it will cost you about Y=30 a night. You will receive a survival certificate from the manager. \n\nWhen the winter's over, Nils holds his annual contest to predict the day that the hotel will fall. The person that guessed the day correctly last year received a large painting from an Artic Hall exhibition. Nils' ice hotel is becoming world famous and he loves his work.

An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day) and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Communications satellites and weather satellites are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas (located on Earth) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, ocean color satellites with visible and near-infrared light sensors (e.g. the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments. \n\nA geostationary orbit is a particular type of geosynchronous orbit, the distinction being that while an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day, an object in geostationary orbit never leaves that position. \n\nThe notion of a geostationary space station equipped with radio communication was published in 1928 by Herman Poto\u010dnik. The first appearance of a geostationary orbit in popular literature was in the first Venus Equilateral story by George O. Smith, but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke disseminated the idea widely, with more details on how it would work, in a 1945 paper entitled \"Extra-Terrestrial Relays \u2014 Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?\", published in \"Wireless World\" magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to \"The Complete Venus Equilateral\". The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Similarly, the Clarke Belt is the part of space about above sea level, in the plane of the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit is about in circumference.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is a GEO", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where is it above?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How long is its rotational period", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Does it appear to be moving", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What type of orbit is a GEO", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who first talked about such an object?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "In what story?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did Herman Potocnik mention it", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was Arthur C.

Venice Preserved. \n\nThe prudence of Morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the furious current of these contending parties, when, two days after his return to Hamilton, he was visited by his friend and colleague, the Reverend Mr Poundtext, flying, as he presently found, from the face of John Balfour of Burley, whom he left not a little incensed at the share he had taken in the liberation of Lord Evandale. When the worthy divine had somewhat recruited his spirits, after the hurry and fatigue of his journey, he proceeded to give Morton an account of what had passed in the vicinity of Tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure. \n\nThe night march of Morton had been accomplished with such dexterity, and the men were so faithful to their trust, that Burley received no intelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced. His first enquiry was, whether Macbriar and Kettledrummle had arrived, agreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight. Macbriar had come, and Kettledrummle, though a heavy traveller, might, he was informed, be instantly expected. Burley then dispatched a messenger to Morton's quarters to summon him to an immediate council. The messenger returned with news that he had left the place. Poundtext was next summoned; but he thinking, as he said himself, that it was ill dealing with fractious folk, had withdrawn to his own quiet manse, preferring a dark ride, though he had been on horseback the whole preceding day, to a renewal in the morning of a controversy with Burley, whose ferocity overawed him when unsupported by the firmness of Morton. Burley's next enquiries were directed after Lord Evandale; and great was his rage when he learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the marksmen of Milnwood, under the immediate command of Henry Morton himself.

Joe Favazzo. \n\nIt wasn't until 10 weeks later, on May 28, that Laiaddee's father officially reported her missing to police after learning of his daughter's disappearance from her boyfriend of three years -- identified by Chandler police and friends as Bryan Stewart. \n\nUpon searching the couple's home, authorities found Laiaddee's car, purse, keys and other personal effects. \n\nAs part of their investigation, authorities also discovered that Stewart had been living under a false name for the past eight years.

Some historians contend that the conflict in Asia can be dated back to 7 July 1937 with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, or possibly 19 September 1931, beginning with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. However, it is more widely accepted that the Pacific War itself started in early December 1941, with the Sino-Japanese War then becoming part of it as a theater of the greater World War II.[nb 9] \n\nThe Pacific War saw the Allied powers pitted against the Empire of Japan, the latter briefly aided by Thailand and to a much lesser extent by its Axis allies, Germany and Italy. The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces, accompanied by the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 8 August 1945, resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Following its defeat, Japan's Shinto Emperor stepped down as the divine leader through the Shinto Directive, because the Allied Powers believed this was the major political cause of Japan's military aggression and deconstruction process soon took place to install a new liberal-democratic constitution to the Japanese public as the current Constitution of Japan.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What country was invaded at the onset of the War?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who were the allied against?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And who aided their enemy?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was the culminating point of the war?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which is the only country to ever drop atomic bombs?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "And how many times did they do this?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "And where did they drop these destructive atom bombs?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Japan do after this?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "On which day was the formal white flag flown?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where did it happen?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was Japan's emperor forced to do?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who was the was on July 7, 1937 between?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 76, "span_end": 113, "span_text": "on which date Japan invaded Thailand ", "input_text": "Thailand", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 773, "span_end": 821, "span_text": "Allied powers pitted against the Empire of Japan", "input_text": "the Empire of Japan", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 851, "span_end": 926, "span_text": "Thailand and to a much lesser extent by its Axis allies, Germany and Italy.", "input_text": "Thailand, Germany, and Italy", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 927, "span_end": 995, "span_text": "The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,", "input_text": "the atomic bombings", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 949, "span_end": 1069, "span_text": "the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces,", "input_text": "the United States", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 927, "span_end": 1069, "span_text": "The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces,", "input_text": "twice", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 926, "span_end": 1069, "span_text": " The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces,", "input_text": "Hiroshima and Nagasak", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1135, "span_end": 1215, "span_text": " resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945", "input_text": "they surrendered", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1217, "span_end": 1339, "span_text": "The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.", "input_text": "2 September 1945", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1217, "span_end": 1340, "span_text": "The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.

Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you hated us.\" \n\n\"It wasn't altogether the promise,\" Helen replied. \"We were both highly strung, and I thought Stephen hard and prejudiced; it seemed ridiculous that he should care what the loafers said.

Comics frequently takes the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images. Often textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. Size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images. Common forms of comics include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings.

The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka.

How elegant he looks! Me brother, Molloy Malony, is as like him as two pays.\" \n\nRebecca did not make for the carriage; but as soon as she perceived her old acquaintance Amelia seated in it, acknowledged her presence by a gracious nod and smile, and by kissing and shaking her fingers playfully in the direction of the vehicle. Then she resumed her conversation with General Tufto, who asked \"who the fat officer was in the gold-laced cap?\" on which Becky replied, \"that he was an officer in the East Indian service.\" But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of his company, and came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Jos, \"Well, old boy, how are you?\" and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face and at the black cock's feathers until she began to think she had made a conquest of him.

China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. \n\nChina emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times.

When Hepburn died in 1993, the world mourned the loss of a great beauty, a great actress and a great humanitarian. Born in Belgium on 4th May 1929, Hepburn dreamed of becoming a successful ballet dancer. She had also been a model before she entered the film industry. In 1951, while acting in Monte Carlo Baby, Hepburn met the famous French writer Colette, who was attracted by Hepburn's beauty and charm. She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career. Shortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..] During her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel. Throughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. By showing us the beauty of nature, Hepburn wanted to remind us that we should protect the environment. Hepburn is remembered not just as a great actress, but also as a great humanitarian. She was honoured with a number of awards because of her efforts in her charity work. In 1992, the President of the United States presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1991, Hepburn discovered that she had cancer.

The conference was held at the request of U.S. President Chester A. Arthur. The subject to discuss was the choice of \"a meridian to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world\". It resulted in selection of the Greenwich Meridian as the international standard for zero degrees longitude. \n\nBy the 1870s there was pressure both to establish a prime meridian for worldwide navigation purposes and to unify local times for railway timetables. The first International Geographical Congress, held in Antwerp in 1871, passed a motion in favour of the use of the Greenwich Meridian for (smaller scale) passage charts, suggesting that it should become mandatory within 15 years. In Britain, the Great Western Railway had standardised time by 1840 and in 1847 the \"Railway Clearing Union\" decreed that \"GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it\". The Post Office was by this time transmitting time signals from Greenwich by telegraph to most parts of the country to set the clocks. By January 1848, Bradshaw's railway guide showed the unified times and met with general approval, although legal disputes meant that it was not until 1890 that GMT was formally established across the UK.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Name the conference that is mentioned here?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What date did it occur?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "and where exactly?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was the purpose?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What was the subject of it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "did anyone request for this conference?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who was it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was his title then?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did this conference result in?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What year did they occur pressure to unify local times?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was held in Antwerp?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What year?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 38, "span_text": "The International Meridian Conference ", "input_text": "The International Meridian Conference", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 71, "span_end": 75, "span_text": "1884", "input_text": "1884", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 79, "span_end": 94, "span_text": "Washington, D.C", "input_text": "Washington, D.C", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 119, "span_end": 170, "span_text": "to determine a prime meridian for international use", "input_text": "to determine a prime meridian for international use", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 274, "span_end": 301, "span_text": " the choice of \"a meridian ", "input_text": "the choice of \"a meridian", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 228, "span_end": 247, "span_text": " Chester A.

Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave groups in the late 1970s, particularly electronic synth-pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra and pop rock band Southern All Stars. \n\nEventually, J-pop replaced \"kay\u014dkyoku\" (\"Lyric Singing Music\", a term for Japanese pop music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene. The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music, and now refers to most Japanese popular music. \n\nThe origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language rock music inspired by the likes of The Beatles. Unlike the Japanese music genre called \"kay\u014dkyoku\", J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is similar to that of English. One notable singer to do so is Keisuke Kuwata, who pronounced the Japanese word \"karada\" (\"body\") as \"kyerada\". Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (\"sol\" and \"la\") was usually not used in Japanese music, except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular, Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and The Rolling Stones' song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". Although Japanese pop music changed from music based on Japanese pentatonic scale and distortional tetrachord to the more occidental music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular (such as that of Ringo Shiina).", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the topic today?", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "What is it abbreviating?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did it replacing?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What 's another name for that type of music?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is the subject's place of origin?", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "Yes, but what type of music?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What band was an inspiration?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who mispronounced \"body\" in her native tongue?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is unlike Western music?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Name one song which adopted the major second?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "By what group?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 5, "span_text": "J-pop", "input_text": "J-pop", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 6, "span_end": 42, "span_text": "(often stylized as J-POP; \"jeipoppu\"", "input_text": "\"jeipoppu\"", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 607, "span_end": 668, "span_text": "Eventually, J-pop replaced \"kay\u014dkyoku\" (\"Lyric Singing Music\"", "input_text": "\"Lyric Singing Music\"", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 607, "span_end": 646, "span_text": "Eventually, J-pop replaced \"kay\u014dkyoku\" ", "input_text": "\"kay\u014dkyoku\"", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 192, "span_text": "J-pop (often stylized as J-POP; \"jeipoppu\"; an abbreviation for Japanese pop), natively also known simply as pops, is a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s.", "input_text": "Japan", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 250, "span_end": 296, "span_text": " but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music", "input_text": "in 1960s pop and rock music", "turn_id": 6, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 297, "span_end": 317, "span_text": " such as The Beatles", "input_text": "The Beatles", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1139, "span_end": 1250, "span_text": " One notable singer to do so is Keisuke Kuwata, who pronounced the Japanese word \"karada\" (\"body\") as \"kyerada\"", "input_text": "Keisuke Kuwata", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1252, "span_end": 1360, "span_text": "Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (\"sol\" and \"la\") was usually not used in Japanese music", "input_text": "the major second was usually not used", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1549, "span_end": 1631, "span_text": "which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"", "input_text": "\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1586, "span_end": 1631, "span_text": " The Beatles' song \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"", "input_text": "The Beatles", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "J-pop.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3gm6g9zbknxvo960lr5r7ye0ldymtn", "filename": "middle4979.txt", "story": "Much has been said and written recently about heroes, mainly because many people think we have too few of them. There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes.

His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir, then known as Octavianus (Anglicized as Octavian). He, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC. \n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself \"Princeps Civitatis\" (\"First Citizen of the State\").

It was popular with American readers from the onset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937 on the row. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide. The sales of Margaret Mitchell's novel in the summer of 1936, at the virtually unprecedented price of three dollars, reached about one million by the end of December. Because it was released in the era of the Great Depression and Mitchell worried the high $3.00 price would ruin its chance for success. Actually the book was a bestseller by the time reviews began to appear in national magazines. \n\nHerschel Brickell, a critic for the New York Evening Post, praised Mitchell for the way she \"tosses out the window all the thousands of technical tricks our novelists have been playing with for the past twenty years.\" \n\nOne criticism by literary scholar Patricia Yaeger, leveled at Gone with the Wind, is for its portrayal of African Americans in the 19th century South. Former field hands during the early days of Reconstruction are described behaving \"as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they ran wild~either from wrong pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance.\" In Gone with the Wind Mitchell is blind to racial oppression and 'the inseparability of race and gender\" that defines the southern belle character of Scarlett, according to Patricia Yaeger. \n\nYet there are complexities in the way that Mitchell dealt with racial issues. Scarlett was asked by a Yankee woman for advice on who to appoint as a nurse for her children; Scarlett suggested a \"darky\", much to the disgust of the Yankee woman who was seeking an Irish maid, a \"Bridget\". African Americans and Irish Americans are treated \"in precisely the same way\" in Gone with the Wind, writes David O'Connell in his 1996 book, The Irish Roots of Margaret Mitchells Gone with the Wind. Ethnic slurs on the Irish and Irish stereotypes spread in every part of the novel, O'Connell claims, and Scarlett is not an exception to the insults. And apparently in the novel, the Irish American O'Haras were slaveholders whereas African Americans were held as slaves. \n\nSpeaking on the subject of whether Gone with the Wind should be taught in schools, James Loewen, author of Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, says the novel should be taught in schools. Students should be told that Gone with the Wind presents the wrong view of slavery, Loewen states. Besides, the main complaint was that the racial slur \"nigger\" appears repeatedly in the novel. In the same complaint were several other books: The Nigger of the 'Narcissus', Uncle Tom's Cabin, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. \n\nAnother criticism of the novel is that it promotes plantation values. Mitchell biographer Marianne Walker, author of Margaret Mitchell & John Marsh: The Love Story Behind Gone with the Wind, is of the opinion that those who believe Gone with the Wind promotes plantation values have not read the book. Walker states it is the popular 1939 film that \"promotes a false notion of the Old South\". She goes on to add that Mitchell had no involvement in the production of the film. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of Gone with the Wind is that people worldwide would incorrectly think it was the true story of the Old South and how it was changed by the American Civil War and Reconstruction. The film version of the novel \"amplified this effect\". Scholars of the period have written in recent years about the negative effects the novel has had on race relations.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What book was the top American bestseller the year it was published?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who wrote it?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What year did it come out?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who praised the author?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "He was a critic for whom?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In what year was it determined to be the second favorite book of American readers?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How much was the book being sold for in 1936?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Who criticized the author for how she portrayed black people?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did James Loewen think the title should be taught to kids in school?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is another criticism of this book?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are there complexities in the way she dealt with race?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 18, "span_text": "Gone with the Wind", "input_text": "Gone with the Wind", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 41, "span_end": 58, "span_text": "Margaret Mitchell", "input_text": "Margaret Mitchell", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 79, "span_end": 83, "span_text": "1936", "input_text": "1936", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 800, "span_end": 816, "span_text": "Herschel Brickel", "input_text": "Herschel Brickel", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 836, "span_end": 857, "span_text": "New York Evening Post", "input_text": "New York Evening Post", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 240, "span_end": 244, "span_text": "2014", "input_text": "2014", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 503, "span_end": 516, "span_text": "three dollars", "input_text": "three dollars", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1054, "span_end": 1069, "span_text": "Patricia Yaeger", "input_text": "Patricia Yaeger", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 2565, "span_end": 2709, "span_text": "James Loewen, author of Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, says the novel should be taught in schools", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2847, "span_end": 2903, "span_text": "the racial slur \"nigger\" appears repeatedly in the novel", "input_text": "the racial slur \"nigger\" appears repeatedly in the novel", "turn_id": 10, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1722, "span_end": 1798, "span_text": "Yet there are complexities in the way that Mitchell dealt with racial issues", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high19355.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3ywrv122cszv3xjlrvli7cz7kicu8m", "filename": "Nashville,_Tennessee.txt", "story": "Nashville is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the seat of Davidson County.

Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds. \n\nNow there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \"It's not easy work,\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\" \n\nTo adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded. \n\nDespite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \"I'm fed up,\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\" she said. \"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\" \n\nTo visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas. \n\nStudent visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University. \n\nBy its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID. \n\n\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\" \n\nAfter giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. \n\nAfter an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\" \n\n\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many US visa officers are in China?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who is Charles Bennett?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does he make that causes tiredness?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What documents does a Chinese applicant need to bring to the US Embassy?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Who is Xu Yong?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How old is he?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What happened with his application?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Wendly Liu say about the application process?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What do the Chinese have to do to get a doctor's appointment?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long does it take to get a driver's license?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Why was Lucy's application rejected?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why was Wendy's application rejected?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Where's she going to go now?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How old is she?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is she married?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who is Tan Ge?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Where is he now?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What are his interests?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What did he have to give up when his application was rejected?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "To which school?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 571, "span_end": 574, "span_text": "100", "input_text": "100", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 736, "span_end": 775, "span_text": "minister-counselor for Consular Affairs", "input_text": "minister-counselor for Consular Affairs", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 858, "span_end": 881, "span_text": "life-changing decisions", "input_text": "life-changing decisions", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 2270, "span_end": 2357, "span_text": "bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID.

The museum's most popular display was the skeleton of a huge, extinct elephant, which Peale _ on a New York farm in 1801. Three of Peale's seventeen children were also famous artists. Paphaelle Peale often painted still lives of flowers, fruit, and cheese. His brother Rembrandt studied under his father and painted portraits of many noted people, including one of George Washington.

When the bell rings, students of Luohu Foreign Languages School in Shenzhen quickly take out their cell-phones. They want to log on to their microblogs to check the funny things that have happened in the last hour. Since last year, the trend of microblogging has swept the country. Recent surveys show that most students in middle schools have a microblog, and some even update their blogs over five times per day. \"We learn many fresh and interesting things on microblogs and they have become popular topics in class,\" said Liang Jianmin, 14, a student at Harbin No 3 Middle School. \"If you do not know about them, you are out of the loop .\" It is also a great place for students to _ stress. \"My parents always ask me to study hard, and encourage me before exams, but actually it adds pressure ,\" said Zhang Yazhe, 15, a student in Luohu Foreign Languages School. \"When I share these feelings on my microblog, I get many replies from friends in the same situation, which makes me feel better.\" But parents are worried that microblogging could be a waste of time. Some misleading messages may even cause danger to kids, they said. Shen Mingde, a professor at the China Education Association, suggests parents not worry too much as long as kids are not crazy about microblogging. Instead, it can become a window for parents to understand their children. \"If parents can read their children's microblogs, they'll know their thoughts, thus leading to better communication and solutions to problems,\" he said. Micro blogging tips for kids 1. Don't microblog for more than one hour a day. 2. Never microblog in class. 3. Try to talk face to face with people instead of just microblogging. 4. Be critical .

He is best known to Western readers for Red Sorghum Clan , which was later adapted for the film, Red Sorghum. In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Mo Yan was born in Gaomi County, Shandong Province. He was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution started, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. At the age of 18, he began to work at a factory. During this period, his access to literature was largely limited to novels. At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo joined the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and began writing. During this period, the works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as William Faulkner, made an impact on his works. In 1984, he received a literary award from the PLA Magazine, and at the same year he began attending the Military Art Academy, where he first used the pen name of Mo Yan. \"Mo Yan\" means \"don't speak\" in Chinese. He explained that the name came from a warning from his father and mother about not saying what he thought when he was outside. It also related to the subject matter of his writings. Mo's first novel was Falling Rain on a Spring Night, published in 1981. Several of his novels were translated into English by Howard Goldblatt, professor of East Asian languages and literature, at the University of Notre Dame. He published his first novella , A Transparent Radish, in 1984, and released Red Sorghum Clan in 1986, making him a nationally recognized novelist.

Naturalist Edward O. Wilson jokes that unlike other kids, he never grew out of his bug period. \n\nLuckily for this biologist, his lifelong passion for ants has led to a career rich in accomplishments and praise. He is not just the world's foremost expert on the social behavior of ants, but also the receiver of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction. Now, at the age of 80, Wilson has tried his hand at fiction. His first novel, Anthill, combines two of his greatest loves -- his childhood home, Alabama, and the ants that have been his lifelong friends. \n\nDescribed as a \"six-legged Iliad,\" Wilson's Anthill draws parallels between human and ant societies. Though there are no ant bands, secret police, or schools of philosophy, both ants and man conduct wars, divide themselves into specialized classes of workers, build cities, maintain infant nurseries and cemeteries, take slaves and practice agriculture, though ant societies are more energetic, selfless, and efficient than human ones. \n\nThe book's first and third sections deal with the adventures of an Alabama boy, Raphael Semmes Cody, who goes by the name Raff. The boy grows up knocking around the Nokobee woods; he's drawn to its natural wonders, and uses the forest to escape from his parents' unhappy marriage. In the woods he leaves almost no stone unturned as he discovers the forest's rich flora and fauna . Raff grows up and heads to Harvard to study law, but returns later in life to protect the Nokobee from crazy developers. But fans of Wilson's science will be most interested in the book's middle section, where the author inserts a mini-novel describing the trials and sufferings of the ants living in the endangered forest. \n\nReviews of the book have been mixed. Writing for The New York Review of Books, Margaret Atwood praised Wilson for his first novel, saying that it is highlighted by a diversity of ideas and an imaginative plot.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.8\u00a0billion followers or 24.1% of the global population, known as Muslims. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 50 countries. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, unique and has guided mankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, viewed by Muslims as the word of God, and the teachings and normative example (called the \"sunnah\", composed of accounts called \"hadith\") of Muhammad ( 570\u20138 June 632 CE). \n\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. As for the Quran, Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God.

His assistant, Dr Watson, watches with admiration and then writes up the story of the mystery afterwards. This is a useful story writing skill. Because Watson is not very clever, the story remains a mystery until the end. The readers can sometimes pick up some clues before he does! Then, to make Watson understand the mystery, Holmes has to explain it all, step by step. So we, the readers, get to see it step by step too. Watson is almost as good a character in the story as Sherlock Holmes! The very first time they meet, Holmes greatly surprises Watson. When they are first introduced, Holmes says to Watson, 'How do you do? I see you have been to Afghanistan .' Watson is too amazed by this to ask Holmes how he knows this. Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country. Observation Three At the time, the British army had soldiers at bases in many parts of the world. So there were still a lot of places to choose from. However, Holmes saw that Watson looked very tired and he was always holding his left arm, as if it was painful. So, he had probably been with the army to a place where they were fighting.

When she was 11 months old, she made her first advertisement on TV. She made her first movie at the age of 2. Five years later, she acted Gertie in Steven Spielberg's famous film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). However, it wasn't all roses and sunshine when Barrymore was growing up. She was drinking wine by the time she was 9, smoking marijuana at 10. Most kid stars in Hollywood fail to become stars as adults. And most of the time, once they're out of the spotlight, they stay out. But Drew Barrymore doesn't. As she was growing older, Barrymore got to learn that life is more meaningful than dangerous actions in the films. She started to build a career in 1997. She has made many successful films since then, including Charlie's Angels (2000) and 50 First Dates (2004). \"In my life, there is darkness and drama, and I 'm trying my best.

But the dreams may soon come true as research findings in laboratories are being turned into products more rapidly in the new century, according to experts participating in the fourth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Technomart, a technology exhibition and trade fair in Suzhou. \n\n\"Most people think nano-technology is too far-fetched to be real. But in fact nano-technology has been applied in a wide range of fields, such as medicine. It is coming into our daily life,\" said Cheng Jiachong from a Hong Kong-based nano-technology firm. \n\nNano-technology based on the nanometer, the unit of which is a billionth of a meter, enables scientists to have new concepts of disease diagnosis and treatment on a molecular and atomic scale, Cheng said. \n\nBy using nanometer particles, a doctor can separate the fetus cells from the blood of a pregnant woman to see if the development of the fetus is normal. This method is also being used in the early diagnosis of cancer and heart disease, he said. \n\nOne of the most significant impacts of nano-technology is at the bio-inorganic materials interface, according to Greg Tegart, executive advisor of the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. \n\n\"By combining enzymes and silicon chips we can produce biosensors. These could be implanted in humans or animals to monitor health and to deliver corrective doses of drugs,\" he told the participants a technology forum during the exhibition. \n\n\"Nano-technology could affect the production of nearly every man-made object, from automobiles, tires and computer circuits , to advanced medicines and tissue replacement, and lead to the invention of objects yet to be imagined,\" said David Minns, a special advisor to the National Research Council of Canada. \n\nIt has been shown that carbon nano-tubes are ten times as strong as steel, with one sixth of the weight, and nano-scale systems have the potential to make supersonic transport cost- effective and to increase computer efficiency by millions of times, he said. \n\nThe experts agreed that the APEC

Located in the North-West of the Iberian Peninsula, it comprises the provinces of A Coru\u00f1a, Lugo, Ourense and Pontevedra, being bordered by Portugal to the south, the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n and Asturias to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the north. It had a population of 2,765,940 in 2013 and has a total area of 29,574 km2 (11,419 sq mi). Galicia has over 1,660 km (1,030 mi) of coastline, including its offshore islands and islets, among them C\u00edes Islands, Ons, S\u00e1lvora, Cortegada, and\u2014the largest and most populated\u2014A Illa de Arousa. \n\nThe area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, currently in force.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What country is Galicia in?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who first inhabited the region?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which group of people?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Which river did the CELTIC people live north of?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How much coastline does Galicia have?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was the first empire to rule the area?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "at the end of what war?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "When did this happen?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Was it then made into a province?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When did this happen?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Which kingdom next took hold?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 216, "span_end": 235, "span_text": "community of Spain ", "input_text": "Spain", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 896, "span_end": 921, "span_text": "first inhabited by humans", "input_text": "humans", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 933, "span_end": 951, "span_text": "Middle Paleolithic", "input_text": "Middle Paleolithic", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1039, "span_end": 1052, "span_text": " Douro river ", "input_text": "Douro", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 682, "span_end": 715, "span_text": "1,660 km (1,030 mi) of coastline,", "input_text": "1,660 km", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1198, "span_end": 1211, "span_text": "Roman Empire ", "input_text": "Roman", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1229, "span_end": 1245, "span_text": "Cantabrian Wars ", "input_text": "Cantabrian", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1248, "span_end": 1253, "span_text": "19 BC", "input_text": "19 BC", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1260, "span_end": 1311, "span_text": " turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1274, "span_end": 1311, "span_text": " Roman province in the 3rd century AD", "input_text": "3rd century AD", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1325, "span_end": 1398, "span_text": "Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal)", "input_text": "Germanic Suebi", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "Galicia_(Spain)Galicia_(Spain)_10438e544e8f5440626995d38246ebc2b116927e4e4c1785e777a610"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3570y55xzpjrdl98kuuv2ami3f5ygo", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/R M Ballantyne___The Thorogood Family.txt/CHAPTER SEVEN_891eb63a148d5bcda885e476e7c483d890b21fcb8c0e6f6eb7d629c", "story": "CHAPTER SEVEN. \n\nTwelve months passed away, and Christmas came again, with its frost and snow and sunshine--its blazing fires, its good cheer, and its merry greetings. \n\nMany a Christmastide had now passed over the head of our blacksmith, John Thorogood, and his excellent wife Mary, but Time had touched them lightly in its flight.

If he doesn't see any danger, he'll come out and run around on top of the snow to get some of the seeds in the tops of the tall grasses that stick out through the snow. If nothing frightens him, he'll keep going, a little farther and a little farther from that old fence-post.

It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres (79,284 square miles) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011, approximately 56% of the country's total population. Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore. Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east. In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south, Balochist\u0101n and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north. \n\nPunjab's geography mostly consists of the alluvial plain of the Indus River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers. There are several mountainous regions, including the Sulaiman Mountains in the southwest part of the province, and Margalla Hills, Salt Range, and Pothohar Plateau in the north. Agriculture is the chief source of income and employment in Punjab; wheat and cotton are the principal crops.

Edwin Gariguez became concerned when a European company announced plans to mine for nickel on the island. The Roman Catholic minister said waste materials from the mining project would pollute the water and destroy the forests. So he started a campaign to stop the project. \n\nIn China, Ma June is working with businesses to clean up their pollution. He formed a group that collects information about pollution, and publishes it on the Internet. \n\nThe Goldman Prize was also awarded to activists from Argentina, Russia and the United States. \n\nSofia Gatica of Argentina is from a town where farmers commonly use pesticide products to protect soybean crops from insects. The town also has a high rate of cancer. Miz Gatica believed that pesticide use was responsible for the death of her baby. She worked with other mothers to get government officials to ban the use of chemicals near populated areas. \n\nEvgenia Chirikova objects to the plans to build a road through a protected forest just outside Moscow. She has demanded that Russian officials redirect the road away from the forest. She and her followers have been arrested for their activities.

Instead they found themselves reunited with their long lost canine. \n\nThe James' had not seen Reckless, a brown and white terrier-pitbull mix, since he went missing over a year and a half ago during Superstorm Sandy. They had lost their beloved pup after the fence in their Keansburg, New Jersey, home was mangled during the storm, Chuck James told CNN on Friday. \n\nWhile the family never stopped looking for Reckless, for their 10-year-old daughter's birthday they decided it was time to move on and adopt a new dog at the Monmouth County SPCA. \n\nTo their surprise, the first dog they were introduced to was one named Lucas, who had a striking resemblance to their former pup. \n\n\"He jumped 3 feet in the air,\" James said. \"He immediately recognized us. And then the tears came -- there wasn't a dry eye in the place.\" \n\nThe James' confirmed it was their dog based on an uncanny scar on the top of his head. \n\n\"After Sandy, we had so many animals being turned in,\" said Jerry Rosenthal, president and CEO of the animal shelter. Rosenthal told CNN that 3-year-old Reckless ended up at the shelter last November after an employee found him on the streets. \n\nRosenthal believes Reckless was taken in by another family for a period of time before he once again got loose. \n\nRosenthal said the James' story really emphasizes the importance of getting your pet microchipped.

However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \"plane\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined $ 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety.

As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events when 60% of marine species were wiped out. \n\nA significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed and bony fish. Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian. However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian. \n\nThe Silurian system was first identified by British geologist Roderick Murchison, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures, inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick, who had named the period of his study the Cambrian, from the Latin name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures. In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title \"On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,\" which was the germ of the modern geological time scale.

After a while an old coach broke down in the middle of the road, and the driver couldn't move it. It was eight o'clock, the middle of the rush hour, so it soon created a terrible traffic jam.

This eventually received the support of the Spanish Crown, which saw a chance to enter the spice trade with Asia through this new route. During his first voyage in 1492, he reached the New World instead of arriving in Japan as he had intended, landing on an island in the Bahamas archipelago that he named San Salvador. Over the course of three more voyages, he visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America, claiming all of it for the Crown of Castile. \n\nColumbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas, having been preceded by the Viking expedition led by Leif Erikson in the 11th century, but his voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas, inaugurating a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted several centuries. These voyages thus had an enormous effect on the historical development of the modern Western world. He spearheaded the transatlantic slave trade and has been accused by several historians of initiating the genocide of the Hispaniola natives.

The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. \n\nThe city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans. Eventually Sicily would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the city being discussed?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "When was it established?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was the name given to it by the Greeks?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How does that translate?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which means?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How did the Arabs refer to it", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did they rule?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What occured in 1860?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How did the Phoenicians refer to the city?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Which means?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Where is it located?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is the city recognized for its cousine?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Are there any significant bodies of water nearby?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Can you name one?", "turn_id": 15}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 7, "span_text": "Palermo", "input_text": "Palermo", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 566, "span_end": 572, "span_text": "734 BC", "input_text": "734 BC", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 88, "span_end": 96, "span_text": "\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "input_text": "\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 98, "span_end": 106, "span_text": "Panormos", "input_text": "Panormos", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 88, "span_end": 96, "span_text": "\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "input_text": "\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "turn_id": 5, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1001, "span_end": 1007, "span_text": "Balarm", "input_text": "Balarm", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 850, "span_end": 866, "span_text": "From 831 to 1072", "input_text": "From 831 to 1072", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1406, "span_end": 1425, "span_text": "Italian unification", "input_text": "Italian unification", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 595, "span_end": 598, "span_text": "Ziz", "input_text": "Ziz", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 601, "span_end": 606, "span_text": "flowe", "input_text": "flowe", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 453, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "northwest of the island of Sicily", "input_text": "northwest of Sicily", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 266, "span_end": 426, "span_text": "The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old.", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 292, "span_end": 337, "span_text": "history, culture, architecture and gastronomy", "input_text": "history, architecture and gastronomy", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 427, "span_end": 541, "span_text": "Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. \n", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 501, "span_end": 516, "span_text": "Gulf of Palermo", "input_text": "Gulf of Palermo", "turn_id": 15}], "name": "PalermoPalermo_4ddf35f128faa82ac0677835cab05dfff56554868d64760627c7a550"}, {"source": "race", "id": "324g5b4fb38bnx2mjjfs45f5tdb70q", "filename": "middle803.txt", "story": "It was three o'clock.

She had written to Thirlwell, telling him when she would be ready to begin her search for the ore, and now waited his reply. Her letter might take some time to reach him, and she must allow for his messenger's journey to the railroad from the mine; but she knew she would feel restless until the answer came. \n\nThe evening was calm, the air was fresher than in the city, and she found the quiet soothing. A field of timothy grass near the house rippled languidly, the dark heads rising stiffly upright when the faint breeze dropped. Sometimes there was a movement among the tall blades and feathery plumes of the Indian corn, and then the rustle stopped and everything was still. Beyond the zig-zag fence, the fruit trees ran back in rows that converged and melted into a blurred mass at the edge of the bush. The narrow landscape had no prominent feature. It was smooth and calm, and Agatha found it rested her eyes and brain. She wanted to be tranquil, but must shortly rouse herself when Mrs. Farnam and George began their joint attack.

In his mind all Americans are connected to China in some way. The forum was held in Pittsburgh, once a US industrial center, now facing job-cuts because of competition brought about by globalization. The aim of the forum is to help American students learn more about the outside world. Elliott Blackwell, a junior at the Neighborhood Academy, said the forum let him know more about how China's economic development will affect America in the future. Some students, although impressed by China's economic boom, expressed uneasiness about the nation's practices and differences from the American way of doing business and politics. \"China is a power coming up,so they might challenge us,\" Paul Amon, a junior from Oil City High School, said. \"I'd hope that China can be our partner but I think that we'd clash along the way because we're too different,\" he added. George Riley, a teacher explained: \"The view of China is usually negative and I think that's fueled by the media.\" However, some negative feelings are not from the media. Merri Ebel is a senior at East Allegheny High School north of Pittsburgh. Both her parents lost their jobs recently.

Charles had received a collection of manuscripts from his predecessor, John II, and transferred them to the Louvre from the Palais de la Cit\u00e9. The first librarian of record was Claude Mallet, the king's valet de chambre, who made a sort of catalogue, \"Inventoire des Livres du Roy nostre Seigneur estans au Chastel du Louvre\". Jean Blanchet made another list in 1380 and Jean de B\u00e9gue one in 1411 and another in 1424. Charles V was a patron of learning and encouraged the making and collection of books. It is known that he employed Nicholas Oresme, Raoul de Presle and others to transcribe ancient texts. At the death of Charles VI, this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the Duke of Bedford, who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435. \n\nCharles VII did little to repair the loss of these books, but the invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by Louis XI in 1461. Charles VIII seized a part of the collection of the kings of Aragon. Louis XII, who had inherited the library at Blois, incorporated the latter into the \"Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi\" and further enriched it with the Gruthuyse collection and with plunder from Milan. Francis I transferred the collection in 1534 to Fontainebleau and merged it with his private library.

But, nevertheless, he had not the heart to go about the work the moment that he left her. He passed by the apothecary's, and looking in saw a young man working sedulously at a pestle. If Albert Fitzallen were fit to be her husband and willing to be so, poor as he was himself, he would still make some pecuniary sacrifice by which he might quiet his own conscience and make Mary's marriage possible. He still had a sum of \u00a31,200 belonging to him, that being all his remaining capital; and the half of that he would give to Mary as her dower.

On November 25, he was joining in fighter jet landing exercises for the Liaoning as usual. Shortly after the successful landing of the J-15, Luo experienced a sudden heart attack. He was soon sent to the hospital but the doctors couldn't save his life. Luo was given an award for his special contribution to the country by China Central Television on February 19. As general manager of the Shenyang Aircraft Corp, Luo didn't use his power to improve the quality of his life. He gave up the chance to move into a new apartment. His suit was ten years old and his watch strap was faded .All he focused on was the aircraft industry. Luo seldom had the time for a good chat with his wife and daughter. He always started work at 6 am and returned home around midnight when they were sleeping. When devoted to his work, Luo always forgot about everything else. His final days were all spent on the J-15. At one point, he felt unwell, but he didn't leave the carrier or see a doctor. \"I spent eight days on the carrier with Luo. He worked all day and night under huge pressure,\" recalled Meng Jun, one of his colleagues . Luo's death is a big _ to the country.

It's a small arena with capacity for only 1,200 people, not counting standing-room-only tickets. As the members of the team are introduced, fans jump up to cheer them on, clapping and chanting, full of team spirit. \"I've been yelling my heart out!\" says a fan who arrived early for the game. \n\nThe team is \"The Miners\" and on a recent night it was playing at home in Cananea, a town of 33,000 in northwestern Mexico, known for its large deposits of copper and other metals. One of the largest mining companies in Mexico operates in the town about 35 miles south of the Arizona border. \n\nIt's an unlikely place for foreigners, but not when it comes to sports. Davin White, 29, is an American immigrant in Cananea and a star forward for the Miners. White attended California State University in Northridge and has also played in Serbia, Italy and Qatar. But Cananea is much closer to his native Phoenix. \"The town is very small, but the people are very energetic when it comes to basketball,\" says White. \n\nHe doesn't speak Spanish, but that doesn't seem to be a problem on the court.

There is no word coming out, but you just know he's screaming 'Where is Millie' inside. Millie was really his best friend. They would play together happily for hours. None of his toys has ever held his attention that long. Now he has just completely turned quiet again. \"Harry suffers from a condition which affects his ability to speak and move. But the dog's being with him achieved more in days than months of speech therapy and physiotherapy had. Mrs Hainsworth says, \"My son was so happy when he saw Millie. Being with Millie changed him, and within two weeks he had said his first words and was working on saying 'dad'. Just last week, his teachers and I were saying how much Millie had helped him. And now this!\" Mrs Hainsworth is considering buying another pug in the hope that her son will accept it. Maureen Hennis of the charity, Pets as Therapy, says she has seen many cases of dogs helping people with speech problems. \"People may talk to a dog when they wouldn't like to talk to another human,\" she says. \"A dog doesn't care if words come out wrong.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Did someone have a pet?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What kind?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What was it named?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who owned it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old was he?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who was his mother?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did the pet affect the kid?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How so?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Did something happen to the pet?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How long after they got it?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was the kid happy or sad about this?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is there an organization that deals with this sort of relationship?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who is someone that works there?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Do they charge money for their services?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did the kid get another pet?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Did the kid continue speaking after the pet was gone?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "How long would the pet and the kid goof off?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Was he the same way with toys?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 66, "span_end": 99, "span_text": " he was given a pug called Millie", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 79, "span_end": 86, "span_text": " a pug ", "input_text": "a pug", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 93, "span_end": 99, "span_text": "Millie", "input_text": "Millie", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 6, "span_text": "Harry ", "input_text": "Harry", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 50, "span_end": 57, "span_text": "fourth ", "input_text": "four", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 449, "span_end": 463, "span_text": "Mrs Hainsworth", "input_text": "Mrs Hainsworth", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 908, "span_end": 984, "span_text": "the dog's being with him achieved more in days than months of speech therapy", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1105, "span_end": 1149, "span_text": "within two weeks he had said his first words", "input_text": "within two weeks he had said his first words", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 230, "span_end": 251, "span_text": "thieves stole the dog", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 230, "span_end": 251, "span_text": "thieves stole the dog", "input_text": "thieves stole the dog", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 212, "span_end": 228, "span_text": "two months later", "input_text": "two months", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 499, "span_end": 502, "span_text": "sad", "input_text": "sad", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1398, "span_end": 1413, "span_text": "Pets as Therapy", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1398, "span_end": 1413, "span_text": "Pets as Therapy", "input_text": "Pets as Therapy", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1367, "span_end": 1382, "span_text": "Maureen Hennis ", "input_text": "Maureen Hennis", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1389, "span_end": 1396, "span_text": "charity", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 17, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 317, "span_end": 339, "span_text": "He has refused to talk", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 18, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 713, "span_end": 724, "span_text": "for hours.

The kelvin (symbol: K) is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The kelvin is defined as the fraction of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (exactly 0.01\u00a0\u00b0C or 32.018\u00a0\u00b0F). In other words, it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16\u00a0K. \n\nThe Kelvin scale is named after the Belfast-born, Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824\u20131907), who wrote of the need for an \"absolute thermometric scale\". Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and degree Celsius, the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree. The kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude. The definition implies that absolute zero (0\u00a0K) is equivalent to . \n\nIn 1848, William Thomson, who later was made Lord Kelvin, wrote in his paper, \"On an Absolute Thermometric Scale\", of the need for a scale whereby \"infinite cold\" (absolute zero) was the scale's null point, and which used the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Kelvin calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to \u2212273\u00a0\u00b0C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale. Kelvin's value of \"\u2212273\" was the negative reciprocal of 0.00366\u2014the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice point, giving a remarkable consistency to the currently accepted value.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What activity stops at absolute zero?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "On which scale is it the null point?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "For whom is the Kelvin scale named?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What was his title?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "When was he born?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did he die?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What school did he work at?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What paper did Lord Kelvin write?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 201, "span_text": "The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics.", "input_text": "all thermal motion", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 202, "span_text": "The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics.

She said she wanted to know the stories behind the images of her parents and uncles. \n\nAnita Davenport's grandfather, Walter, was stationed in Battle Creek, Michigan, during World War I. \n\nThe stories she found -- and shared during several phone conversations from her home in Culver City, California -- parallel the African-American journey during the past century. \n\nThe search took her to 1894, when her grandfather, Walter, was born in Stone Mountain, Georgia. \n\nWalter Davenport moved to Wedowee, Alabama. During World War I, Davenport was stationed at Fort Custer in Battle Creek, Michigan, Anita said. \n\nThousands of other African-Americans were also on the move, mainly to the Northeast and the Midwest, eager for opportunities related to the war and industrialization, according to Howard Dodson, a historian and the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. \n\nWalter Davenport later returned to Alabama, married and had nine children, one of whom was Anita's father, Frank. \n\nWalter was fond of Battle Creek and regaled his family with stories, Anita said. The stories must have been convincing.

Before reaching the flat they had passed almost within bow-shot of the spot where Gunrig and his men lay in ambush, and that chief might easily have fallen upon and killed many of them, had he not been restrained by the strict orders of Gadarn to let them pass on to the camp unmolested.

We'd just seen Leo make a goal. It was the happiest moment of our life.\" \n\nIf the Falcons could pull this off and win their first state championship, it would be thanks largely to Hiroyo. She was the one who introduced Leo, Kalani's star and last year's ESPN high school player of the year in Hawaii, to the sport when he was just 7. She was the one who spent hour after hour with Leo, working on his game when he needed to catch up with the other boys. \n\n\"I wasn't that good at soccer,\" Leo said, explaining that his playing time was limited to three-minute spurts so the better players could catch a quick rest. \n\nSo mom was there with support and encouragement. \n\n\"She helped me practice by myself at the park,\" Leo, 17, said. \"My mom taught me about resiliency. And how you would get nowhere without having a good work ethic.\" \n\nAbout 10 minutes into the second half, the game stopped and an ambulance was rushed onto the field. Leo and his teammates waited out the 10- to 15-minute delay before the ambulance rushed off.

Rome \n\nOne warm, still day, late in the Roman autumn, our two young men were sitting beneath one of the high-stemmed pines of the Villa Ludovisi. They had been spending an hour in the mouldy little garden-house, where the colossal mask of the famous Juno looks out with blank eyes from that dusky corner which must seem to her the last possible stage of a lapse from Olympus. Then they had wandered out into the gardens, and were lounging away the morning under the spell of their magical picturesqueness. Roderick declared that he would go nowhere else; that, after the Juno, it was a profanation to look at anything but sky and trees. There was a fresco of Guercino, to which Rowland, though he had seen it on his former visit to Rome, went dutifully to pay his respects. But Roderick, though he had never seen it, declared that it could n't be worth a fig, and that he did n't care to look at ugly things. He remained stretched on his overcoat, which he had spread on the grass, while Rowland went off envying the intellectual comfort of genius, which can arrive at serene conclusions without disagreeable processes.

Its founding purpose was to serve the Northwest Territory, an area that today includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota. Instruction began in 1855; women were admitted in 1869. Today, the main campus is a 240-acre (97 ha) parcel in Evanston, along the shores of Lake Michigan just 12 miles north of downtown Chicago. The university's law, medical, and professional schools are located on a 25-acre (10 ha) campus in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. In 2008, the university opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar with programs in journalism and communication. \n\nThe foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory.

It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening. \n\nIn North America, in the late 1990s, the mainstream music industry adopted and to some extent manufactured \"electronica\" as an umbrella term encompassing styles such as techno, big beat, drum and bass, trip hop, downtempo, and ambient, regardless of whether it was curated by indie labels catering to the \"underground\" nightclub and rave scenes, or licensed by major labels and marketed to mainstream audiences as a commercially viable alternative to alternative rock music. By the late 2000s, however, the industry abandoned \"electronica\" in favor of \"electronic dance music\" (EDM), a term with roots in academia and an increasing association with outdoor music festivals and relatively mainstream, post-rave electro house and dubstep music. Nevertheless, the U.S.-based \"AllMusic\" still categorises electronica as a top-level genre, stating that it includes danceable grooves, as well as music for headphones and chillout areas. \n\nIn other parts of the world, especially in the UK, \"electronica\" is also a broad term, but is associated with non-dance-oriented music, including relatively experimental styles of downtempo electronic music.

A much bigger islet, \u00cele Fourchue, lies on the north of the island, in the Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy Channel. Other rocky islets which include Coco, the Roques (or little Turtle rocks), the Goat, and the Sugarloaf. \n\nResidents of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (Saint-Barth\u00e9lemoise people) are French citizens and work at establishments on the island. Most of them are descendants of the first settlers, of Breton, Norman, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Angevin lineage. French is the native tongue of the population. English is understood in hotels and restaurants, and a small population of Anglophones have been resident in Gustavia for many years. The St. Barth\u00e9lemy French patois is spoken by some 500\u2013700 people in the leeward portion of the island and is superficially related to Quebec French, whereas Cr\u00e9ole French is limited to the windward side. Unlike other populations in the Caribbean, language preference between the Cr\u00e9ole and Patois is geographically, and not racially, determined.[page needed]", "questions": [{"input_text": "The inhabitants of St. Barth\u00e9lemy are what nationality?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it located off the coast of California?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "The where?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "IS the native language english?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What island is it close to?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How far?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is that in standard measurement?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Who were the first settlers?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What chain of islands is it part of?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 751, "span_end": 808, "span_text": "Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (Saint-Barth\u00e9lemoise people) are French ", "input_text": "French", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 182, "span_text": "Located approximately 250 kilometres (160 mi) east of Puerto Rico and the nearer Virgin Islands, St. Barth\u00e9lemy lies immediately southeast of the islands of Saint Martin and Anguilla", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 54, "span_end": 95, "span_text": "Puerto Rico and the nearer Virgin Islands", "input_text": "Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 974, "span_end": 1019, "span_text": "French is the native tongue of the population", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 974, "span_end": 1020, "span_text": "French is the native tongue of the population.", "input_text": "French", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 53, "span_end": 65, "span_text": " Puerto Rico", "input_text": "Puerto Rico", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 22, "span_end": 37, "span_text": "250 kilometres ", "input_text": "250 kilometres", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 37, "span_end": 44, "span_text": "(160 mi", "input_text": "160 mi", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 895, "span_end": 964, "span_text": "first settlers, of Breton, Norman, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Angevin", "input_text": "Breton, Norman, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Angevin", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 190, "span_end": 221, "span_text": "one of the Renaissance Islands.", "input_text": "Renaissance Islands.", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemySaint_Barth%C3%A9lemy_73650c7345a6664f03abb24b3da352c7bc802c53e833d0cdeb1d9a7a"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3xcc1odxdlb9t9r09v7dosxn7rfqre", "filename": "Hinduism.txt", "story": "Hinduism is an Indian religion, or a way of life, widely practiced in South Asia. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \"\", \"the eternal tradition,\" or the \"eternal way,\" beyond human history. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \"Hindu synthesis\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE). \n\nAlthough Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, it is linked by shared concepts, recognisable rituals, cosmology, shared textual resources, and pilgrimage to sacred sites. Hindu texts are classified into \u015aruti (\"heard\") and Sm\u1e5bti (\"remembered\"). These texts discuss theology, philosophy, mythology, Vedic yajna, Yoga, agamic rituals, and temple building, among other topics. Major scriptures include the Vedas and Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Agamas. Sources of authority and eternal truths in its texts play an important role, but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of the questioning of this authority, to deepen the understanding of these truths and to further develop the tradition. \n\nProminent themes in Hindu beliefs include the four Puru\u1e63\u0101rthas, the proper goals or aims of human life, namely Dharma (ethics/duties), Artha (prosperity/work), Kama (desires/passions) and Moksha (liberation/freedom/salvation); karma (action, intent and consequences), Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (cycle of rebirth), and the various Yogas (paths or practices to attain moksha). Hindu practices include rituals such as puja (worship) and recitations, meditation, family-oriented rites of passage, annual festivals, and occasional pilgrimages. Some Hindus leave their social world and material possessions, then engage in lifelong Sannyasa (monastic practices) to achieve Moksha. Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (ahimsa), patience, forbearance, self-restraint, and compassion, among others.

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. \n\nThe founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students. \n\nFacebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\".

This implies that Korean is not an isolate, but a member of a small family. The idea that Korean belongs to the controversial Altaic language family is discredited in academic research. There is still debate about a relation to Dravidian languages and on whether Korean and Japanese are related to each other. The Korean language is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax. \n\nModern Korean descends from Middle Korean, which in turn descends from Old Korean, which descends from the language spoken in Prehistoric Korea (labeled Proto-Korean), whose nature is debated, in part because Korean genetic origins are controversial. A relation of Korean (together with its extinct relatives which form the Koreanic family) with Japonic languages has been proposed by linguists such as William George Aston and Samuel Martin.

Johnson started smoking when he was 13 and died of lung cancer when he was 36. \n\nThe jury award Friday evening is \"courageous,\" said Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Chestnut. \n\n\"If anyone saw the documents that this jury saw, I believe that person would have awarded a similar or greater verdict amount,\" he said. \n\nThe Escambia County trial took four weeks and the jury deliberated for 15 hours, according to the Pensacola News Journal. The verdict included more than $16 million in compensatory damages, the newspaper said. \n\nNine ex-smokers on their last cigarette \n\nChestnut said five of the six jurors who heard the case were 45 or younger, which meant he had to show them how the tobacco industry presented its product before the public awareness campaigns on tobacco risks and dangers in the 1990s. \n\nIn a statement, J. Jeffery Raborn, vice president and assistant general counsel for R. J. Reynolds, said, \"The damages awarded in this case are grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law. \n\n\"This verdict goes far beyond the realm of reasonableness and fairness and is completely inconsistent with the evidence presented,\" said Raborn. \"We plan to file post-trial motions with the trial court promptly and are confident that the court will follow the law and not allow this runaway verdict to stand.\" ", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who was given the money?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How much was that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "for what?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who was the defendant?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "In which state?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Who was the plaintiff?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who was killed?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How did he got the ailment?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did they point finger to anyone?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who was that?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Did they tell him beforehand about the danger?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Who actully gave the verdict?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who broke the news?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How long the process took?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Was the company happy about it?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who expressed that opinion?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is he?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "Do they want to counter it?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "Are they confident abotut it?", "turn_id": 22}, {"input_text": "Where they will protest about it?", "turn_id": 23}], "answers": [{"span_start": 32, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "a widow", "input_text": "a widow", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 40, "span_end": 53, "span_text": "$23.6 billion", "input_text": "$23.6 billion", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 178, "span_end": 217, "span_text": "claimed that smoking killed her husband", "input_text": "claimed that smoking killed her husband", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 110, "span_end": 140, "span_text": " R.J.
