In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How long did it take for Newton's laws to be corrected?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Whose theory had accurate predictions?", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 654, "span_end": 754, "span_text": "Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.", "input_text": "nearly three hundred years.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 782, "span_end": 848, "span_text": "Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted", "input_text": "Einstein", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "ForceForce_b6300a77dde2d26b6635a27eda0d8667d2e386e86ec523792280a0d4"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3qemnnsb2xz5mh3gvv3njczons87dn", "filename": "high11089.txt", "story": "It's summer movie time again.

Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. \n\nMary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. \n\nThe story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. \n\n\"The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point,\" writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson, \"The focus is firmly on following your dream.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What famous fairy tale is this movie about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "what is this story's setting?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "in what country?", "turn_id": 3}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 33, "span_text": "Few of us haven't read Cinderella", "input_text": "Few of us haven't read Cinderella Cinderella", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 327, "span_end": 411, "span_text": " Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school.

The recent successes he had met with in Botallack enabled him to achieve his aim more rapidly than he had anticipated, and on the day following that in which Clearemout received his deserts, he went to Penberth Cove to see that all was in readiness, for pilchards had recently appeared off the coast in small shoals. \n\nThat same day Oliver Trembath, having spent a night of misery in Penzance, made up his mind to return to St. Just and face his fate like a man; but he found it so difficult to carry this resolve into effect that he diverged from the highroad--as he had done on his first memorable visit to that region--and, without knowing very well why, sauntered in a very unenviable frame of mind towards Penberth Cove. \n\nOld Mr Donnithorne possessed a pretty villa near the cove, to which he was wont to migrate when Mrs D felt a desire for change of air, and in which he frequently entertained large parties of friends in the summer season. In his heart poor Mr Donnithorne had condemned this villa \"to the hammer,\" but the improved appearance of things in the mines had induced him to suspend the execution of the sentence. News of the appearance of pilchards, and a desire to give Rose a change after her late adventure, induced Mr Donnithorne to hire a phaeton (he had recently parted with his own) and drive over to Penberth.

In 1967, Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma led a successful military coup d'\u00e9tat after which he became president. At the time of his death in 2005, Gnassingb\u00e9 was the longest-serving leader in modern African history, after having been president for 38 years. In 2005, his son Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was elected president. \n\nTogo is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation, whose economy depends highly on agriculture, with a climate that provides good growing seasons. While the official language is French, many other languages are spoken in Togo, particularly those of the Gbe family. The largest religious group in Togo consists of those with indigenous beliefs, and there are significant Christian and Muslim minorities.

The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey. \n\nThe breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. \"The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,\" Professor Raisman said. \n\nPolish doctors injected the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves. \n\nProfessor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. \"I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me.

They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail. \n\nNorwegian researchers at the University of Troms\u00f8 have shown that some Arctic animals (ptarmigan, reindeer) show circadian rhythms only in the parts of the year that have daily sunrises and sunsets.

He got his nickname for smuggling cigarettes across borders. \n\nThought to be about 40, Belmokhtar was rumored to have been killed or wounded in March during the French military intervention in Mali.

He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. \"As long as it works\", he said in 1991, \"I'll continue to do those commercials.\" \n\nEven though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. \"He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,\" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. \"He fed me,\" Thomas said, \"and if I got out of line, he'd beat me.\" \n\nMoving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. \"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\" he said, \"I could eat for free.\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. \n\nIn 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes $ 6 billion a year in sales. \n\nAlthough troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children.

Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. \n\nCompression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Because compressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space\u2013time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Why is compression Useful?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What are the type of resource usage", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is the use for this space?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is the example of the situation for the compressed data?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What utilized encoding information?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the name of the process at which this is used.", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What are the two varieties of compression?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What differentiate the Lossy?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is data compression called?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Do video compression require costly materials?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 717, "span_end": 747, "span_text": "it helps reduce resource usage", "input_text": "it helps reduce resource usage", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 756, "span_end": 800, "span_text": " data storage space or transmission capacity", "input_text": "data storage space or transmission capacity", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 810, "span_end": 854, "span_text": "compressed data must be decompressed to use,", "input_text": "SO as o compress data?", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1066, "span_end": 1094, "span_text": "compression scheme for video", "input_text": "compression scheme for video", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 21, "span_end": 76, "span_text": " data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction", "input_text": "data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 2, "span_end": 20, "span_text": " signal processing", "input_text": "signal processing", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 184, "span_end": 201, "span_text": "lossy or lossless", "input_text": "lossy or lossless", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 339, "span_end": 425, "span_text": " Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it", "input_text": "Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 441, "span_end": 474, "span_text": " reducing the size of a data file", "input_text": "reducing the size of a data file", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1066, "span_end": 1125, "span_text": "compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "Data_compressionData_compression_c14d3ae39539fe835a39d01c86aaa09a4a1a2cee31f2c369f095faa2"}, {"source": "race", "id": "3z4xg4zf48rnk1dgw0w5rjybeuwx88", "filename": "high3794.txt", "story": "An inventor seeks to create a new product that serves a specific need and fulfills a role that other products do not. Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea, but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design. With a little imagination and creativity , an old idea can suddenly become something new. \n\nHowever, creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea. A good designer follows the design process: identifying the challenge, researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution, testing and evaluating the ideas, and finally building the product. Designers also use science, math, technology, and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified. \n\nAnyone can be an inventor --even kids! For example, Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life. In fact, his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life. You may not know his name, but you probably know his invention --earmuffs ! \n\nThe inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice-skating. His ears were cold, and he decided to find a way to keep them warm. With the help of his grandmother, he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen, Chester patented his earmuff design. \n\nMany other famous inventors started young as well. Margaret Knight --the inventor of the flat-bottomed brown paper bag --is said to have created a safety device for textile looms when she was just twelve years old.

It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\". \n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the Neoclassical style. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage. In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829. \n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings.

A distinction is generally made between the \"first colonial empire\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \"second colonial empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. \n\nCompeting with Spain, Portugal, the United Provinces, and later England, France began to establish colonies in North America, the Caribbean, and India in the 17th century. A series of wars with Great Britain and other European major powers during the 18th century and early 19th century resulted in France losing nearly all of its conquests.

About November,he wrote: \n\nNo warmth,no cheerfulness,no healthful ease \n\nNo shade,no shine,no butterflies,no bees \n\nNovember! \n\nOn the other hand,another English poet John Keats,already sensing he was seriously ill,was inspired by a late September day to pen one of the most famous poems in the English language,To Autumn. He wrote to a friend afterwards that there was something comforting and healing about it. \n\nAccording to Richard Mabey,Keats has the biological evidence on his side. Autumn is not a time of slowing down,but a time of new beginnings and great movements of creatures. For example,just at the moment that Keats's \"gathering swallows\" ( in To Autumn)are departing for Africa,millions of creatures are fleeing from the frozen north like Iceland,Greenland and Russia to winter along the east and south coasts of Britain. According to scientists,before falling,the leaves transfer their chlorophyll and carbohydrates into the woody parts of the tree for safe keeping over winter. What remains is the natural antioxidants in the leaves: the yellow and orange carotenoids ,and another protective chemical specially produced for autumn,the bright-red anthocyanin .High colour is not a signal of deterioration and decline,but of detox ability and good health. \n\nA century after Keats,the American poet Loren Eiseley wrote in his journal: \n\n\"Suppose we saw ourselves burning-like maples in a golden autumn. And that we could break up like autumn leaves...dropping their substance like chlorophyll.

And the company's symbol Ronald McDonald is now (or so the company claims) the word's most recognized person after Santa Claus. \n\nThe first McDonald's restaurant was opened in San Bernardino, California, in 1948 by brothers Mac and Richard \"Dick\" McDonald. Mac ran the restaurant side; Dick was the marketing genius. He had already invented the drive-in laundry and had been the first person to use neon lights in advertising. Now he spotted the gap in the post-war, baby-boom market for cheap, family-orientated restaurants with simple menus, standardized food and efficient service. \n\nAfter a slow start, business began to boom. By 1954, the brothers were joined by another entrepreneur, a kitchen equipment salesman called Ray A Kroc who owned the franchise to the Multimixer, milk shake maker used throughout the McDonald's chain. A year later, Kroc had bought the McDonald brothers' chain of 25 franchises for the equivalent of around $70m(PS44m). Dick remained with the company until the Seventies, when he and Kroc fell out over Kroc's claim that the chain was his creation. \n\nToday, an almost Stalinist cult of personality surrounds Kroc (who died in 1984) at McDonald's, while the brothers who gave the company its name have all but been written out of its history. But though Kroc did not found McDonald's, he was certainly responsible for the empire-building philosophy which led to its world domination. He ushered in such essential contributions to international cuisine as the Big Mac (1968) and the Egg McMuffin (1973); and helped launch Ronald McDonald ---- \"in any language he means fun\" ---- on to television in 1963. \n\nEvery three hours, a new McDonald's franchise opens somewhere in the world; it can be found in more than 100 countries including India (vegetarian-only to avoid offending the non-beef-eating populace) and Israel (non kosher, despite fierce local objection).

In the course of his careful feeding of him, he gave him an occasional chicken bone. Two lessons, which would scarcely be called lessons, since both of them occurred within five minutes and each was not over half a minute in duration, sufficed to teach Michael that only on the floor of the room in the corner nearest the door could he chew chicken bones. Thereafter, without prompting, as a matter of course when handed a bone, he carried it to the corner. \n\nAnd why not? He had the wit to grasp what Steward desired of him; he had the heart that made it a happiness for him to serve. Steward was a god who was kind, who loved him with voice and lip, who loved him with touch of hand, rub of nose, or enfolding arm. As all service flourishes in the soil of love, so with Michael. Had Steward commanded him to forego the chicken bone after it was in the corner, he would have served him by foregoing.

Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first founded. In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government. Many countries have numerous powerful political parties, such as Germany and India and some nations have one-party systems, such as China.

student.He ran over. \n\nRicks,22,tried to appear calm as he instructed Gdmth to remove the car.Both of them could now see the wheel between the rails and the uneven track bed.Ricks put his hands under the front fender and gave it a push.It didn't move. \n\nHe pushed it again with all his strength,Still,no movement. \n\nFrom about 50 feet away,a group of students from the nearby university watched the scene.Ricks signaled to them,and five of the guys came over. \n\nHe directed them to different sides of the car,and they all put their hands under the flame. \n\n\"One,two,three\" Ricks yelled.They all pushed. \n\n\"One,two,three!\" he yelled again.The car didn't move. \n\nAt that moment,they felt the ground begin to shake.Then four dings signaled an on coming train,apd the railroad gates dropped down.In the distance,an unclear line of light appeared,followed by the loud noise of a horn . \n\nThe guys started yelling,\"Get out of the car!Get out of the car!\"But Griffith felt _ . \n\nWhen Griffith glanced in the mirror,she saw the train lights approaching.But she worried that the Arthritis in her feet would prevent her from escaping in time and that her car would bedamaged.One of the students,Tommy Stackhouse,20,saw her shocked face and knew he had to act.He reached for the car door and forced it open. \n\nThe train was just a few hundred feet away.In the last few seconds,Stackhouse grasped Griffith's arm and pulled her from the car.His friend,Frank DiPietrapaul,18,grasped her other arm,and the pair pulled Griffith aside. \n\nThey watched as the train,crashed into the car,cutting it into half its original size and sending metal pieces flying.Griffith sat crying as the police arrived and sorted through the ruins--and wrote her a ticket for no attention to driving.Eventually,the students went home. \n\nA few days later,a reporter asked the young men and Griffith to reunite at a local coffee shop.There a tearful Griffith hugged her rescuers.\"These boys are heroes,\"she would later tell anyone who would listen.\"They saved my life.\" \n\nRicks feels only grateful for the outcone.\"It was one of those moments,\" he says,\"when we could have been gone together.It makes you think how precious life is.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was it that made June Griffith realize something was wrong?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who was it that

This is sometimes abbreviated in databases and catalogs as 6lobe (starting with numeral, \"6\", not a capital letter, \"G\"). Torx Plus is an improved head profile. \n\nTorx screws are commonly found on automobiles, motorcycles, bicycle brake systems (disc brakes), hard disk drives, computer systems and consumer electronics. Initially, they were sometimes used in applications requiring tamper resistance, since the drive systems and screwdrivers were not widely available; as drivers became more common, tamper-resistant variants, as described below, were developed. Torx screws are also becoming increasingly popular in construction industries. \n\nBy design, Torx head screws resist cam-out better than Phillips head or slot head screws. Whereas Phillips heads were allegedly designed to \"cause\" the driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to \"prevent\" cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When was Torx created?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Is it trademarked?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's special about it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What do people like to call it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Is there an official generic name?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is it?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does this have a shortened version?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What/", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who made this the official name?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Are there other types of screw heads?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What are they?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Which one makes the driver cam out?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What do Torx stop?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What does a slot head do best?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Where are Torx starting to get more popular?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Do you see them on cars?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 37, "span_text": "Torx (pronounced ), developed in 1967", "input_text": "1967", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 56, "span_text": "Torx (pronounced ), developed in 1967 by Camcar Textron,", "input_text": "Camcar Textron,", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 55, "span_end": 73, "span_text": ", is the trademark", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 145, "span_text": "Torx (pronounced ), developed in 1967 by Camcar Textron, is the trademark for a type of screw head characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern", "input_text": "a type of screw head", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 99, "span_end": 145, "span_text": "characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern", "input_text": "a 6-point star-shaped pattern", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 146, "span_end": 193, "span_text": " A popular generic name for the drive is \"star\"", "input_text": "star", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 194, "span_end": 230, "span_text": " as in star screwdriver or star bits", "input_text": "as in star screwdriver", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 230, "span_end": 257, "span_text": ".

The town is filled with thousands of middle class college kids living off their parent's money. \n\nThe coffee shop is where the ones come to play the part of sophisticated bohemians . The pretensions glow from their line-less faces as they sip cappuccinos and chew strawberry cookies. The boys to my right are discussing Nabokov with a serious air, a copy of Sartre's Cuba lies on the table. \n\nThe young woman on my left is declaring that she can never allow her creativity to be killed by entering the work force. The man with her scratches his goatee in agreement, occasionally suggesting they go back to his place to hear his new Washington Squares CD. Matt has just designed a new international symbol for peace. He moves from table to table trying to sell hand painted T-shirts that bear the design. Tomorrow he's leaving for the 25th anniversary Woodstock concert where he hopes to strike it rich with his creation. \n\nGopha the skinny Indian boy feels like singing me a verse of 'It Ain't Me Babe' when I ask him if he's a friend of Monica's. Jason is trying to talk Gopha into a dollar bet on a game of chess. Between times Jason will chew your ear off with his plans to conquer the music industry while studying entertainment law, but when it comes to his never ending dollar chess matches he's quiet as a church mouse. \n\nI sit among them.

I chat warmly with whoever decides to squander away their hours in my surrounding area. \n\nBut behind my eyes is an unspoken challenge to any and every one of these social elites to just once say one thing that would inspire me. Just one little idea which is new and meaningful. Unfortunately original thoughts are zero here. \n\nIn my secret mind I wish to run like a madman banging gongs and speaking in tongues. Or maybe jump on a table and sing the Star Spangled Banner in the forgotten language of the Hottentots.

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history.

Mr. Earnshaw travels to Liverpool, where he adopts a homeless Gypsy boy, naming him \"Heathcliff\". Hindley finds himself robbed of his father's love and care and becomes bitterly jealous of the newcomer. However, Catherine grows very attached to him. Soon, the two children spend hours on the moors together and hate every moment apart. Because of the conflict , Hindley is eventually sent to college. However, he marries a woman named Frances and returns three years later, after Mr. Earnshaw dies. He becomes master of Wuthering Heights, making Heathcliff their servant instead of a family member. Months after Hindley's return, Heathcliff and Catherine travel to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the Linton family. However, they are found and try to escape. Catherine is caught by a dog, and then brought inside the Grange to have injuries tended to while Heathcliff is sent home. Catherine eventually returns to Wuthering Heights as a changed woman, looking and acting as a lady. She laughs at HeathcIiff's dirty appearance. When the Lintons visit the next day, Heathcliff dresses up to impress her. It fails, however, when Edgar, one of the Lintons' children, argues with him. Heathcliff is locked in the attic, where Catherine later tries to comfort him. He swears revenge on Hindley. In the summer of the next year, Frances gives birth to a son, Hareton, but she dies before the year is out. This leads Hindley to fall into a life of drunkenness and waste. Two years pass and Catherine has become close friends with Edgar, growing more distant from Heathcliff. One day in August, while Hindley is absent, Edgar comes to visit Catherine. Before long, they declare themselves lovers. Catherine explains to Nelly, her servant, that she does not really love Edgar but Heathcliff. Unfortunately, she could never marry Heathcliff because of his lack of status and education. She therefore plans to marry Edgar and use that position to help raise Heathcliff's status. Unfortunately, Heathcliff has overheard _ and runs away, disappearing without a trace. After three years, Edgar and Catherine are married. Six months after their marriage, Heathcliff returns as a gentleman, having grown stronger and richer. Catherine is delighted to see him although Edgar is not so keen. Edgar's sister, Isabella, now eighteen, falls in love with Heathcliff. He looks down upon her but encourages the adolescent love, seeing it as a chance for revenge on Edgar. When he embraces Isabella one day at the Grange, there is an argument with Edgar, which causes Catherine to lock herself in her room and fall ill. Heathcliff has been staying at the Heights, gambling with Hindley and teaching Hareton bad habits. Hindley is gradually losing his wealth, mortgaging the farmhouse to Heathcliff to repay his debts. While Catherine is ill, Heathcliff leaves with Isabella, causing Edgar to disown (......) his sister. The two marry and return two months later to Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff hears that Catherine is ill and arranges to visit her in secret. In the early hours of the day after their meeting, Catherine gives birth to her daughter, Cathy, and then dies. Hindley dies six months after Catherine.

Craig Miller said. \n\nPolice used ballistic tests to link Smith, a Utah state police officer for 12 years, to the shootings in which one driver was killed, one was injured by shattered glass and one escaped uninjured, Dallas police detective Lt. Craig Miller said. \n\nMiller said it is unclear if Smith was involved in the other fatal shooting, which was the first attack of the evening. \n\nFour motorists were attacked along a three-mile stretch near and on the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas, on Monday evening, police said. \n\nThe first attack, which happened in Garland, Texas, about 5:41 p.m., killed Jorge Lopez.

Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States. \n\nThe 8- and 10-county definitions are not used for the greater Southern California Megaregion, one of the 11 megaregions of the United States. The megaregion's area is more expansive, extending east into Las Vegas, Nevada, and south across the Mexican border into Tijuana. \n\nSouthern California includes the heavily built-up urban area stretching along the Pacific coast from Ventura, through the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Inland Empire, and down to Greater San Diego. Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas, or MSAs: the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties; the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the San Diego metropolitan area; the Oxnard\u2013Thousand Oaks\u2013Ventura metropolitan area; the Santa Barbara metro area; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area; and the El Centro area. Out of these, three are heavy populated areas: the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants, and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants. For CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people. With over 22 million people, southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California's population.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How many counties make up the focus area?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Name all the counties starting with a consonant.", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which are the two remaining?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "SoCal's population includes how many metro areas?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Which is one area?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Which counties make up that area?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is another MSA?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How many counties is it made up of?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Which is one?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "And the other?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Which counties make up the Greater LA area?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is the population in that area?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What percent of the Cali population is that?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 146, "span_end": 204, "span_text": "The region is traditionally described as \"eight counties\",", "input_text": "eight", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 342, "span_text": " Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.", "input_text": "Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 341, "span_text": " Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura", "input_text": "Imperial and Orange", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1057, "span_end": 1128, "span_text": " Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas,", "input_text": "seven", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 1138, "span_end": 1172, "span_text": "the Los Angeles metropolitan area,", "input_text": "the Los Angeles metropolitan area", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1138, "span_end": 1219, "span_text": "the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties;", "input_text": "Los Angeles and Orange", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1220, "span_end": 1239, "span_text": "the Inland Empire, ", "input_text": "the Inland Empire", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1219, "span_end": 1290, "span_text": " the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1220, "span_end": 1290, "span_text": "the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties", "input_text": "Riverside", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1220, "span_end": 1290, "span_text": "the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties", "input_text": "San Bernardino", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1137, "span_end": 1219, "span_text": " the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties;", "input_text": "Los Angeles and Orange", "turn_id": 11, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1729, "span_end": 1897, "span_text": "the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people.", "input_text": "over 17.5 million", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1927, "span_end": 2002, "span_text": "southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California's population.", "input_text": "roughly 60 percent", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "Southern_CaliforniaSouthern_California_c77c9a243770d41602ac2edc93625493f877ac91a5e69ae0652f844f"}, {"source": "cnn", "id": "3m81gab8a0jmd2abdylnodsjoslbq4", "filename": "cnn_1f18ebb4523c883d79a0d350b89f0eb8df5eb2b9.story", "story": "Washington (CNN) -- The federal government said it will recommend that new cars have rear-view video systems, a move immediately denounced as \"insufficient\" by safety groups who say the cameras should be mandatory. \n\nThe camera and monitor system enables drivers to see whether people or objects are in the blind spot behind vehicles. \n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday it will add the rear-view video systems to its list of recommended features under its New Car Assessment Program, designed to encourage car manufacturers to improve vehicle safety. \n\nBut safety groups called the action a stalling tactic, saying the agency is dragging its feet in fulfilling a congressionally imposed deadline to issue a rule on rear visibility. \n\nPassed in 2008, the law had a 2011 deadline.

inspector general investigation has found. \n\nIn exchange, agents allow contraband or unauthorized immigrants through inspection lanes, protect or escort traffickers or leak sensitive information, said Charles Edwards, acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nTestifying before a Senate subcommittee, Edwards cited the Zetas drug cartel as one of the leaders \"involved increasingly in systematic corruption.\" \n\nHe did not elaborate on how non-cash methods of corruption, like sexual favors, have been used to corrupt agents. \n\nSince October 2004, 127 Customs and Border Protection employees have been arrested or indicted for acts of corruption, said agency Commissioner Alan Bersin, speaking at the same hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and Intergovernmental Affairs. \n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon's offensive against the drug cartels, combined with a surge in the hiring of border agents in recent years, have multiplied the risks of corruption, Bersin said. \n\nToday, the Border Patrol counts more than 20,700 agents, more than double its size in 2004. Bersin implied that the rapid hiring spree may have come at the cost of hiring less qualified agents. \n\n\"The accelerated hiring pace under which we operated between 2006 and 2008 -- and, frankly, mistakes from which we are learning -- exposed critical organizational and individual vulnerabilities within CBP,\" he said. \n\nTo face this challenge, the commissioner touted the passage of the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010, which requires that by 2013, all the agency's law enforcement applicants must receive a polygraph test before being hired. It also calls for periodic reinvestigations into the background of its agents.

Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron, and Scott had passed away, and it seemed as if there were no writers in England to fill their places. Wordsworth had written, in 1835, \n\nLike clouds that rake, the mountain summits, Or waves that own no curbing hand, How fast has brother followed brother, From sunshine to the sunless land! \n\nIn these lines is reflected the sorrowful spirit of a literary man of the early nineteenth century who remembered the glory that had passed away from the earth. But the leanness of these first years is more apparent than real. Keats and Shelley were dead, it is true, but already there had appeared three disciples of these poets who were destined to be far more widely, read than were their masters. Tennyson had been publishing poetry since 1827, his first poems appearing almost simultaneously with the last work of Byron, Shelley, and Keats; but it was not until 1842, with the publication of his collected poems, in two volumes, that England recognized in him one of her great literary leaders. So also Elizabeth Barrett had been writing since 1820, but not till twenty years later did her poems become deservedly popular; and Browning had published his _Pauline_ in 1833, but it was not until 1846, when he published the last of the series called _Bells and Pomegranates_, that the reading public began to appreciate his power and originality. Moreover, even as romanticism seemed passing away, a group of great prose writers--Dickens, Thackeray, Carlyle, and Ruskin--had already begun to proclaim the literary glory of a new age, which now seems to rank only just below the Elizabethan and the Romantic periods.

Now Peter climbed about 30 meters up and hit a piton into the rock. Fastening one end of a 50meter rope to the piton, he let the other end of the rope fall down. Mark caught the rope and fastened it to his belt. He next reached above his head and fastened a T-bar to the rope. Mark took a deep breath, pushed the Tbar up almost as far as his arms could reach, and began the first pullup. High above, Peter let out a cheer, \"You're on your way.\" For the first four days the two men progressed upward without accident. But on the fifth day, a very strong wind began to blow, making it hard for Mark to hold on to his rope. But Mark kept on pushing up the T-bar and pulling himself up.

It gets you to _ the setting of the story and gets you to think more about what's going on in the story,the important events of the story.\"\" Instead of just doing work sheets about it,this is a lot more fun,\" Logan added happily. \n\nMorgan Van Fleet likes being in the Academy. She says boys and girls act differently when they are together in a classroom. \"To me,it almost seems like it's hindering your chances at developing yourself because you're more focused on 'Oh,I wish they'd shut up. Oh,what do they think of me?' instead of focusing on what's the homework or what's going on in this class,what's the lesson.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where does this story take place?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "At what institution?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who teaches 9th grade?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who does he teach?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What are his pupils doing?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "By what authors?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "How do they study?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is the goal of the Facility?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who's drwain in place of reading?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Was this wrong?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Why did they draw?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Who enjoys the courses?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What does this allow her to do?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Who interviewed the instructor?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "How long has the instructor taught?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What else does he do?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Who selects the scholars?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who is accepted?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 42, "span_end": 60, "span_text": "Boonsboro,Maryland", "input_text": "Boonsboro,Maryland", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 20, "span_text": "A public high school", "input_text": "high school", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 685, "span_end": 732, "span_text": "Michael Bair has been at Boonsboro High School ", "input_text": "Michael Bair", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 798, "span_end": 812, "span_text": "class for boys", "input_text": "boys", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 882, "span_end": 923, "span_text": "they're reading now,are very manly novels", "input_text": "they're reading", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 906, "span_end": 923, "span_text": "very manly novels", "input_text": "very manly novels", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1034, "span_end": 1070, "span_text": "The Call of the Wild\" by Jack London", "input_text": "Jack London", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1221, "span_end": 1244, "span_text": "working in small groups", "input_text": "small groups", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 216, "span_end": 683, "span_text": "The aim is to help teenagers keep their mind on their work by keeping males and females apart.

Lisa, 25, had a lot to do at work,plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Lisa felt weak and tired-maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. \n\nSeveral yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. \n\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\" Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No! Not you! \" his girlfriend screamed after him. \n\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Lisa, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. \n\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Lisa briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. \n\nLisa thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. \n\nPolice and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer.

It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew . And the earliest needles were made from bones. Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency. \n\nCharles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection. \n\nFrenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine. \n\nAmerican inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines. \n\nIsaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines. He invented an up-and-down-motion mechanism that replaced the side-to-side machines. He also developed a foot treadle to power his machine. This improvement left the sewer's hands free. Undoubtedly, it was a huge improvement of the hand-cranked machine of the past. Soon the Singer sewing machine achieved more fame than the others for it was more practical. It could be adapted to home use and it could be bought on hire-purchase. The Singer sewing machine became the first home appliance, and the Singer company became one of the first American multinationals. \n\nHowever, Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented. As a result, Howe accused him of patent infringement . Of course, Elias Howe won the court case, and Singer was ordered to pay Howe royalties . In the end, Howe became a millionaire, not by manufacturing the sewing machine, but by receiving royalty payments for his invention.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was Isaac Singer's occupation?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What product did he improve upon?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And who was Elias Howe?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When was his birthdate?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What do these two men have in common regarding their nationality?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Was sewing a new or old practice?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "For how long has it been happening?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "And how did they do it?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was different about what these inventors were creating?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Who ended up in a legal battle?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was the reason?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1463, "span_end": 1502, "span_text": "Isaac Singer, another American inventor", "input_text": "inventor", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1463, "span_end": 1582, "span_text": "Isaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines", "input_text": "sewing machines", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 904, "span_end": 932, "span_text": "American inventor Elias Howe", "input_text": "an inventor", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 922, "span_end": 954, "span_text": "Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819", "input_text": "July 9, 1819", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 904, "span_end": 932, "span_text": "American inventor Elias Howe", "input_text": "Both are from America", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 47, "span_text": "Humans have sewn by hand for thousands of years", "input_text": "old", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 47, "span_text": "Humans have sewn by hand for thousands of years", "input_text": "thousands of years", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 123, "span_end": 168, "span_text": "And the earliest needles were made from bones", "input_text": "used bones", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 528, "span_end": 601, "span_text": "Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine", "input_text": "tried to make a sewing machine", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 2149, "span_end": 2239, "span_text": "However, Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented", "input_text": "Singer and Howe", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 2158, "span_end": 2239, "span_text": "Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented", "input_text": "Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented", "turn_id": 11}], "name": "high4405.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "37c0gnlmhf3mihpbclyvdyzsse26dv", "filename": "ASCIIASCII_97afb6c9c40c79606593a28e36796fa924a0a2f0e5dfc93c235b5149", "story": "Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right. The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, basic punctuation symbols, control codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a space. For example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106. ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered an invisible graphic:223). \n\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.:220, 236\u2009\u00a7\u20098,9) The \"space\" character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier, so it became position 20hex;:237\u2009\u00a7\u200910 for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.

Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \"Gigi\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \"Hoolly Golinghtly\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \"Eliza Doolittle\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II.

Mubarak government jailed the first blogger for four years in 2007.\" \n\nHis group, which issued a statement on the sentence, said Nabil's trial \"has serious implications for freedom of expression on the internet more generally and in particular the ability to expose military abuses.\" \n\n\"The sentence is not only severe, but it was imposed by a military tribunal after an unfair trial,\" Stork said. \n\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the U.S. government is \"deeply concerned\" about Nabil's sentence. \"This is not the kind of progress we're looking for,\" he

The charge he faces carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \n\nHe wrote that he was leaving the United States to join ISIS, according to a criminal complaint.

The earring was stamped with words \"BE HAPPY\". At first I got angry. Then it hit me. I had been putting all of my energies into what was wrong with my life rather than what was right! I decided then and there to make a list of 50 things I was thankful to. At first _ was hard, then it got easier. One day I decided to up it to 75. That night there was a phone call for me, asking if I would do a one-day training for 200 hospital workers. I said yes and got the job. My day with the hospital workers went very well. I got a standing welcome and many more days of work. To this day I KNOW that it was because I changed my attitude to _ . By chance, the day after I found the earring the girl asked me if anyone had looked for it. I told her no and she said \"I guess it was meant for you then.\" I spent the next year doing training workshops all around the Seattle area and then decided to risk everything and go back to Scotland where I had lived before.

The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni, and then organized their conquests as the Province of Britain (). By the year 47, the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way. Control over Wales was delayed by reverses and the effects of Boudica's uprising, but the Romans expanded steadily northward. \n\nUnder the 2nd century emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, two walls were built to defend the Roman province from the Caledonians, whose realms in the Scottish Highlands were never directly controlled.

During the Diocletian Reforms, at the end of the 3rd century, Britannia was divided into four provinces under the direction of a vicarius, who administered the .

It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for the modern Chinese state. \n\nThe dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria. In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing Jurchen clans into \"Banners\", military-social units. Nurhaci formed these clans into a unified entity, the subjects of which became known collectively as the Manchu people. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized Beijing. The conquest of China proper was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661\u20131722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Central Asia. While the early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their official title was Emperor they were known as khans to the Mongols and patronized Tibetan Buddhism, they governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government. They retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus.

She had made up her mind that she would not bow down to Lady Aylmer, and yet she was afraid of the woman. As she got out of the carriage, she looked up, expecting to see her in the hall; but Lady Aylmer was too accurately acquainted with the weights and measures of society for any such movement as that. Had her son brought Lady Emily to the house as his future bride, Lady Aylmer would probably have been in the hall when the arrival took place; and had Clara possessed ten thousand pounds of her own, she would probably have been met at the drawing-room door; but as she had neither money nor title,--as she in fact brought with her no advantages of any sort, Lady Aylmer was found stitching a bit of worsted, as though she had expected no one to come to her. And Belinda Aylmer was stitching also,--by special order from her mother. The reader will remember that Lady Aylmer was not without strong hope that the engagement might even yet be broken off. Snubbing, she thought, might probably be efficacious to this purpose, and so Clara was to be snubbed. \n\nClara, who had just promised to do her best to gain Lady Aylmer's opinion, and who desired to be in some way true to her promise, though she thoroughly believed that her labour would be in vain, put on her pleasantest smile as she entered the room. Belinda, under the pressure of the circumstances, forgetting somewhat of her mother's injunctions, hurried to the door to welcome the stranger.

As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).", "questions": [{"input_text": "what did archaeologists find?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "from what time frame?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "where is it located?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "who were the settlers in the area?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "when did they settle?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "how many people occupied it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "was it ever conquered?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "by who?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "when did they hold power?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "is it the most populated place in the Sea?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 612, "span_end": 710, "span_text": "Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia", "input_text": "the Neolithic village of Khirokitia", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 581, "span_end": 610, "span_text": "around the 10th millennium BC", "input_text": "from the 10th millennium BC", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 177, "span_end": 230, "span_text": "is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea", "input_text": "in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 778, "span_end": 817, "span_text": " Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks", "input_text": "by Mycenaean Greeks", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 834, "span_end": 855, "span_text": "the 2nd millennium BC", "input_text": "the 2nd millennium BC", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 900, "span_end": 1018, "span_text": " it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians,", "input_text": "Nine", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1029, "span_end": 1084, "span_text": "the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great.", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1256, "span_end": 1340, "span_text": " by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).", "input_text": "The Ottoman's", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1284, "span_end": 1318, "span_text": "Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878", "input_text": "between 1571 and 1878", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 271, "span_end": 351, "span_text": "Cyprus is the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "CyprusCyprus_e5dbfe0783bfa7055d4640963692c995fe2480bb2e635df8b03734f1"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "31qnsg6a5rtt5m7pens7xklnc8778r", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/George Eliot___The Mill on the Floss.txt/Chapter II_7214bc08f6397ee457d8474e5a0ed693f12f44881f8e11426418a8a", "story": "Chapter II \n\nMr. Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom \n\n\"What I want, you know,\" said Mr. Tulliver,--\"what I want is to give Tom a good eddication; an eddication as'll be a bread to him.

They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow. \n\nIt was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney disease. \n\nThe decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, \"According to your file, you're supposed to be dead.\" And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _ \n\nWhen the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement. \n\nAt last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, \"I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!\" \n\nFinancially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it. \n\nAt the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this \"change of conduct\" would last in my parents. \n\nWe would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney. \n\nThe surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses. \n\nAs I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment.

It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly custom processes. In social sciences, including economics, the idea of \"standardization\" is close to the solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. This view includes the case of \"spontaneous standardization processes\", to produce de facto standards. \n\nStandard weights and measures were developed by the Indus Valley Civilisation. The centralised weight and measure system served the commercial interest of Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc. Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in categories. Technical standardisation enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Uniform units of length were used in the planning of towns such as Lothal, Surkotada, Kalibangan, Dolavira, Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro. The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified.

I worked there for seven years and learned so many lessons, especially from a fellow waitress Helen who had incredible self-respect and did what she loved--serving people. She made everyone smile and feel good, customers and co-workers alike. \n\nBeing a waitress changed my life. One of my regular customers was Fred Hasbrook, an electronics salesman. Thanks to the newfound confidence I picked up from Helen, I dreamed of having my own restaurant. But when I called my parents to ask for a loan, they said, \"We just don't have the money.\" \n\nThe next day, I shared my dream with him and said, \"Fred, I know I can do more if somebody would just have faith in me.\" \n\nHe walked over to some of the other diner regulars and the next day handed me checks totaling $50,000--along with a note that I have to this day. It reads, \"The only collateral on this loan is my trust in your honesty as a person. Good people with a dream should have the opportunity to make that dream come true.\" \n\nI took the checks to Merrill Lynch--the first time I had ever entered a brokerage house--where the money was invested for me. I continued working at the Buttercup, making plans for the restaurant I would open. My investments soured, though, and I lost the money. \n\nAfter great deliberation I decided to apply for a job at Merrill Lynch. Even though I had no experience, I was hired and ended up becoming a pretty good broker. Eventually I paid back Fred and my customers the $50,000, plus 14-percent annual interest.

Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States, brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.

In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward.

We hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author of Love in a Village, Lionel and Clarissa, and other successful dramatic pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman; somewhat idle and intemperate; who lived nobody knew how nor where, sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who was ever the vagabond's friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the dignity of a disease, which he termed _impecuniosity_, and against which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce had the author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but continued to read in a more elevated tone.

It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. \n\nBecause of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the cricoid cartilage and carina. \n\nCartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of collagenous extracellular matrix, abundant ground substance that is rich in proteoglycan and elastin fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, \"elastic cartilage\", \"hyaline cartilage\" and \"fibrocartilage\", which differ in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan. \n\nCartilage does not contain blood vessels (it is avascular) or nerves (it is aneural). Nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion. The compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage generates fluid flow, which assists diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes. Compared to other connective tissues, cartilage has a very slow turnover of its extracellular matrix and does not repair. In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules (aggrecan and collagen type II) that form the extracellular matrix.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What substance can cartilage be compared to?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Is it flexible or rigid?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where is cartilage located in the body?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Anywhere else?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What is cartilage like compared to muscle?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What kinds of cells is cartilage made up of?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What are they called?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What do they produce?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many types of cartilage are there?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How do they differ?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How do cartilage cells get nutrition?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How often does cartilage repair itself?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does cartilage have blood vessels?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1243, "span_end": 1268, "span_text": " other connective tissues", "input_text": "other connective tissues", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 280, "span_end": 375, "span_text": "It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle.", "input_text": "flexibl", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 180, "span_end": 190, "span_text": ", the ear,", "input_text": ", the ear,", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 167, "span_end": 180, "span_text": " the rib cage", "input_text": "the rib cage", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 331, "span_end": 340, "span_text": " stiffer ", "input_text": "stiffer", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 585, "span_end": 603, "span_text": "specialized cells ", "input_text": "specialized cells", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 610, "span_end": 623, "span_text": "chondrocytes ", "input_text": "chondrocytes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 680, "span_end": 686, "span_text": "matrix", "input_text": "matrix", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 789, "span_end": 795, "span_text": " three", "input_text": "three", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 879, "span_end": 927, "span_text": "in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan", "input_text": "in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1061, "span_end": 1071, "span_text": " diffusion", "input_text": "diffusion", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1337, "span_end": 1354, "span_text": "does not repair.

In metropolitan areas, the term often refers to an inner city neighbourhood, a suburb or a suburban neighborhood. The word \"barangay\" originated from \"balangay\", a kind of boat used by a group of Austronesian peoples when they migrated to the Philippines. \n\nMunicipalities and cities in the Philippines are subdivided into barangays, with the exception of the municipalities of Adams in Ilocos Norte and Kalayaan, Palawan which each contain only one barangay. The barangay itself is sometimes informally subdivided into smaller areas called \"purok\" (\"English: \"), barangay zones consisting of a cluster of houses, and \"sitios\", which are territorial enclaves\u2014usually rural\u2014far from the barangay center. , there were 42,029 barangays throughout the Philippines. \n\nWhen the first Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, they found well-organized independent villages called \"barangays\".

By the time of contact with Spaniards, many barangays have developed into large communities. The \"encomienda\" of 1604 shows that many affluent and powerful coastal barangays in Sulu, Butuan, Panay, Leyte and Cebu, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Pasig, Laguna, and Cagayan River were flourishing trading centers.

In Panay, some barangays had 20,000 inhabitants; in Leyte (Baybay), 15,000 inhabitants; in Cebu, 3,500 residents; in Vitis (Pampanga), 7,000 inhabitants; Pangasinan, 4,000 residents. There were smaller barangays with less number of people. But these were generally inland communities; or if they were coastal, they were not located in areas which were good for business pursuits.

These were lying on a marble table, in the hall; and while the man looked in the drawing-room for his mistress, and sent one of the maids up-stairs in quest of her, Guy hastily took up one, bearing his address, in the well-known hand of Mr. Edmonstone. \n\nYoung Graham, who had taken up a newspaper, was startled by Guy's loud, sudden exclamation,--' \n\n'Ha!

The news, which broke Monday evening, was met with such excitement from fans, celebrities and the media that many were left wondering, \"Seth Mac-who?\" \n\nIt was announced this month that \"Family Guy\" creator MacFarlane would host the 85th Academy Awards. It's still considered a great get for the Oscars, which have been fixated on attracting a younger demographic, but all anybody seems to care about is the Fey/Poehler Globes. \n\nTim Brooks, an author, TV historian and former network executive, told The Hollywood Reporter of MacFarlane's appeal, \"Younger viewers probably know the name, but he's not an A star.\" \n\nIt should be noted, however, that MacFarlane's \"Ted\" recently broke a box office record: The flick about a teddy bear that comes to life has surpassed \"The Hangover\" as the highest-grossing non-sequel R-rated comedy worldwide. \n\nMeanwhile, Brooks said of the Globes pick, \"Tina Fey is a good choice, particularly.

It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, in northwestern Arabia, and in the Sinai peninsula. \n\nThe modern written language (Modern Standard Arabic) is derived from Classical Arabic. It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. The two formal varieties are grouped together as Literary Arabic (\"fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101\"), which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of Islam. Modern Standard Arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties, and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical era, especially in modern times. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also borrowed many words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in European languages, mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Valencian and Catalan, owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the Iberian Peninsula, referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus.

You see, he was thinking how easy it was going to be to catch Paddy the Beaver, and what a splendid meal he would make. He licked his chops at the thought. \n\n\"He doesn't know I know he's here,\" thought Old Man Coyote. \"In fact, I don't believe heaven knows that I am anywhere around. Of course he won't be watching for me. He cuts his trees at night, so all I will have to do is to hide right close by where he is at work, and he'll walk right into my mouth. Sammy Jay knows I was up there this morning, but Sammy sleeps at night, so he will not give the alarm. My, my, how good that Beaver will taste!\" He licked his chops once more, then yawned and closed his eyes for a nap. \n\nOld Man Coyote waited until jolly, round red Mr. Sun had gone to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept out across the Green Meadows. Then, keeping in the blackest of them, and looking very much like a shadow of himself, he slipped into the Green Forest. It was dark in there, and he made straight for Paddy's new pond, trotting along swiftly without making a sound. When he was near the aspen trees which he knew Paddy was planning to cut, he crept forward very slowly and carefully. Everything was still as still could be.

His first resolution was immediately to depart for England; but when, on reflection, he was mindful that, after all, the assertion which had so agitated him might really be without foundation, in spite of many circumstances that to his regardful fancy seemed to accredit it, his firm resolution began to waver. \n\nThese were the first pangs of jealousy that Coningsby had ever experienced, and they revealed to him the immensity of the stake which he was hazarding on a most uncertain die. \n\nThe next morning he called in the Rue Rivoli, and was informed that the family were not at home. He was returning under the arcades, towards the Rue St. Florentin, when Sidonia passed him in an opposite direction, on horseback, and at a rapid rate. Coningsby, who was not observed by him, could not resist a strange temptation to watch for a moment his progress. He saw him enter the court of the hotel where the Wallinger family were staying. Would he come forth immediately? No. Coningsby stood still and pale. Minute followed minute. Coningsby flattered himself that Sidonia was only speaking to the porter. Then he would fain believe Sidonia was writing a note. Then, crossing the street, he mounted by some steps the terrace of the Tuileries, nearly opposite the Hotel of the Minister of Finance, and watched the house.

He did not have enough time to run way. Jackal had played many tricks on Lion over the years, so he knew he would be in trouble if he was caught. Jackal needed to think of something quickly. \"Help! Help!\" cried Jackal as he quickly jumped upon a large rock hanging over the road. \"The rocks are falling down, and I can't hold them much longer. We shall both be crushed if you do not do your best to hold these rocks back, Lion\" At once, Lion pushed his strong shoulder against the rocks to keep them from moving any further. \"I'll just run over here to get something to stop the rocks.\" shouted Jackal as he ran way to safety.

The court ruled that the evasiveness of the testimony the former baseball star gave to a grand jury investigating sales of performance-enhancing drugs was sufficient to convict him. \n\nIn an opinion filed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Mary M. Schroeder said the three-judge panel rejected Bonds' contention that he could only have been indicted for obstruction if his testimony had been flatly false.

When he mentioned his career, one man wanted Duckworth's opinion on his struggles with depression; another asked for advice on a family member's mental illness. \n\n\"I was sort of amazed. They were talking openly about their mental disabilities with a stranger in a swimming locker room, \" said Duckworth, \"That wouldn't have happened 15 years ago. \" \n\nNew research shows that these swimmers aren't the only ones opening up. According to a new study, more American adults than ever are reporting being disabled by the symptoms of depression, anxiety or other emotional problems. \n\nThe report, published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health, found that people who said they couldn't perform everyday tasks or engage in social and leisure activities because of a mental illness increased from 2 percent in 1999 to 2.7 percent in 2009. That increase amounts to nearly 2 million more people disabled by mental distress in the past decade, the report said. \n\nAlthough people did not say they felt more mental distressed compared to past years, they reported that their mental health problems had a greater impact on their daily lives. \n\nDr. Ramin Mojtabai, the study's author, said it's unclear whether the findings tell a sad story of greater mental distress in recent times or point to a victory for public education about the importance of acknowledging and evaluating mental illness. \n\n\"It is possible that people are realizing the effects of mental illness more acutely now than before,\" he said. \"People could be becoming more aware. \" \n\nMojtabai said it's also possible that a number of factors could be taking a toll on the population's mental well-being. High unemployment, economic hardships and a growing sense of isolation could be putting greater stress on Americans. \n\nBut Duckworth said there could be a more positive explanation -- like his fellow swimmers, people may be getting more comfortable with talking about their mental distress. \n\n\"I wonder if this tells us that American culture is becoming more open and is giving people the ability to speak about it,\" he said. \"If people have this problem and are willing to acknowledge it, then we're getting closer to dealing with it.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who is the study's author?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Will the findings tell a sad story?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Will it be of greater or lesser mental distress?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Are people becoming more aware?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is Duckworth sort of amazed?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What were people talking openly about?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "With whom?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Would that have happened 15 years ago?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Is Duckworth a doctor?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What's his job title?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where's he located?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Is he social-able?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What journal was the report published in?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many percent of people in 1999 had trouble with every day tasks?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What else did they have trouble engaging in?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "When did it increase to 2.7 percent?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "How many million of people is that?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Were these people happier or more distressed?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What might be taking a toll on the population's mental health?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1281, "span_end": 1299, "span_text": "Dr. Ramin Mojtabai", "input_text": "Dr. Ramin Mojtabai", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1380, "span_end": 1388, "span_text": "greater ", "input_text": "greater", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 1672, "span_end": 1677, "span_text": "more ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 308, "span_end": 322, "span_text": "sort of amazed", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 360, "span_end": 380, "span_text": " mental disabilities", "input_text": "Their mental disabilities", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 388, "span_end": 397, "span_text": "stranger ", "input_text": "A stranger", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 396, "span_end": 422, "span_text": " in a swimming locker room", "input_text": "In a swimming locker room", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 448, "span_end": 456, "span_text": "wouldn't", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 18, "span_end": 20, "span_text": "Dr", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 39, "span_end": 52, "span_text": "psychiatrist ", "input_text": "psychiatrist", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 55, "span_end": 68, "span_text": "Massachusetts", "input_text": "Massachusetts", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 108, "span_end": 117, "span_text": "chatting ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 754, "span_end": 788, "span_text": " American Journal of Public Health", "input_text": "The American Journal of Public Health", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 940, "span_end": 941, "span_text": "2", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 867, "span_end": 896, "span_text": "social and leisure activities", "input_text": "social and leisure activities", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 976, "span_end": 980, "span_text": "2009", "input_text": "2009", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1013, "span_end": 1023, "span_text": " 2 million", "input_text": "2 million", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1055, "span_end": 1064, "span_text": "distress ", "input_text": "More distressed", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1808, "span_end": 1825, "span_text": "High unemployment", "input_text": "High unemployment", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "high4000.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3r9wasfe2zgl4bni5wqwywv898xzfy", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Hamlin Garland___Money Magic.txt/CHAPTER XII_21d47d300aba426a7d2bed5071c89a5199549774acaaef94ebfcd68", "story": "CHAPTER XII \n\nALICE HEATH HAS A VISION \n\nThis change of legal adviser, while very important to Ben Fordyce and the Haneys, did not seem to trouble Allen Crego very much.

As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration. \n\nVictoria later described her childhood as \"rather melancholy\". Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

It involved every great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire, and affected Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. Considered a prelude to the two world wars and the greatest European war since the Thirty Years War of the 17th century, it once again split Europe into two coalitions, led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other. For the first time, aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia's ever-growing might, France formed a grand coalition of its own, which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world's predominant power, altering the European balance of power. \n\nRealizing that war was imminent, Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Prussia's alliance with Britain, Austria formed an alliance with France, seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia, which had been lost in a previous war. Reluctantly, by following the imperial diet, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states (especially Hanover).

But is today's American Dream a mythical concept or still a reality? \n\nIsabel Belarsky's tiny Brooklyn apartment fills with the sound of her father's voice. Sidor Belarsky sings an Aria in Russian and 90-year-old Isabel, her lips painted an elegant red, sways gently to the song coming from her stereo. \n\nIsabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer: Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience. \n\nHow the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" \n\nLike generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" \n\nThe American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". \n\nThe concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution. \n\nBut somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well. \n\nIn the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. \n\nCheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \n\n\"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious. He came from Mexico City three years ago to go to college here but he's worried that Brooklyn's schools aren't going to give him a good enough education. \"The system is broken; we can't get the superior education that they supposedly want to give us,\" he says. \n\nThrough the centuries America's immigrants have endured terrible hardship and sacrifice so that they and their children can get ahead. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear the members of the Bushwick youth group lament the multiple, low paid jobs that their parents must do simply to get the rent paid and put food on the table. What is startling is that these bright, ambitious youngsters just don't believe that talent and hard work are enough to ensure they will ever have a shot at that mythical American Dream.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who had the American Dream?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was something they dreamed for?", "turn_id": 2}], "answers": [{"span_start": 1204, "span_end": 1297, "span_text": "the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty.", "input_text": "the Belarskys", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 1205, "span_end": 1255, "span_text": "he Belarskys came to America in search of freedom-", "input_text": "freedom", "turn_id": 2}], "name": "high18234.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3c2nj6jbkah7msxned0vjquapi1n2l", "filename": "mc500.train.215", "story": "Ashley woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer.

Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great. Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \"Kids who are now doing text messaging and e-mail will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\" Linguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\", and that they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia Mcvey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway.

The term \"pastor\" also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, but is not synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. Many Protestant churches call their ministers \"pastors\". \n\nPresent-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical image of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (\"ra\u02bfah\") which means shepherd. It occurs 173 times and relates to the feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7, or to the spiritual feeding of human beings, as in Jeremiah 3:15, \"Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding\" (NASB). English-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun (\"poim\u0113n\") as \"shepherd\" and the Greek verb (\"poimaino\") as \"to shepherd\". The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the \"Good Shepherd\" in John 10:11.

They described her as very \"ill-informed\"and \" a loose cannon .\" \n\nThe Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,\" This is a distraction we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\" \n\nOpposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government. \n\nTo try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding. \n\nFor the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause. She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people and their problems.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What device was causing injury to people?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "who was trying to shed light on this issue?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What other organization was a part of this effort?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "what country did she go to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "in what year?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "was this trip a secret and kept out of the press?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "what was filling the tv screens?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "what was her concise message?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "did it seem like her home political body support her trip?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "of what were they unsupportive?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "what weapon did they compare her too?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "did she allow this to concern her?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "did her government know about this trip before she took it?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "did anyone give their approval for her to take the trip?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "who?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "did this cause a few red faces?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "who tried to mitigate the damages?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "what is his title?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "did they seem to have a more compatible opinion with her now?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 137, "span_end": 180, "span_text": "a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines", "input_text": "landmines", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 40, "span_end": 181, "span_text": "Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997, to support the Red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines.", "input_text": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 96, "span_end": 132, "span_text": " to support the Red Cross's campaign", "input_text": "Red Cross", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 181, "span_end": 216, "span_text": " Within hours of arriving in Angola", "input_text": "Angola", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 47, "span_end": 96, "span_text": "Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997,", "input_text": "1997", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 216, "span_end": 345, "span_text": ", television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 217, "span_end": 304, "span_text": " television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims ", "input_text": "images of her comforting victims", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 545, "span_end": 612, "span_text": "Princess concluded with a simple message. \"We must stop landmines.\"", "input_text": "We must stop landmines.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 687, "span_end": 775, "span_text": "But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government", "input_text": "not by some", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 782, "span_end": 824, "span_text": " refused to support a ban on these weapons", "input_text": "they refused to support a ban on these weapons", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 893, "span_end": 958, "span_text": "They described her as very \"ill-informed\"and \" a loose cannon .\" ", "input_text": "a loose cannon", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 960, "span_end": 1016, "span_text": "The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 96, "span_text": "It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997,", "input_text": "It came as a surprise", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1185, "span_end": 1308, "span_text": "To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1272, "span_end": 1307, "span_text": "been approved by the Foreign Office", "input_text": "by the Foreign Office", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1445, "span_end": 1503, "span_text": "The result was a severe embarrassment for the government.

For me, I cannot remember the last time I had to work out the area of a circle, recite a Shakespeare poem or grammar rules, yet I have lived a happy life.

Tongjon has been developed in some Korean private schools. It is quite different from the more rigid system of learning things by heart that is used in Korea, and indeed in many other school systems around the world.

He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. \"As long as it works\", he said in 1991, \"I'll continue to do those commercials.\" \n\nEven though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. \"He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,\" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. \"He fed me,\" Thomas said, \"and if I got out of line, he'd beat me.\" \n\nMoving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. \"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\" he said, \"I could eat for free.\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. \n\nIn 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes $ 6 billion a year in sales. \n\nAlthough troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children. He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992. \n\nIn 1993, Thomas, who had left school at 15, graduated from Coconut Creek High School in Florida. He even took Lorraine to the graduation dance party. The kids voted him Most Likely to Succeed. \n\n\"The Dave you saw on TV was the real Dave,\" says friend Pat Williams. \"He wasn't a great actor or a great speaker . _ .\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Why did Thomas have misshapen feet?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who died when he was 5?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How was she related to him?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What work did his adopted father do?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where were they from originally?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did they stay there throughout Thomas' childhood?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did Thomas move out?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What was his first job?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What happened in 1956?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What job did it lead to?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When did Thomas become a millionaire?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where was Wendy's founded?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "When did Thomas marry?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who is his wife?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many children do they have?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Did Thomas feel that he was happily adopted?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "In response, what did he create?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "At what age did Thomas die?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "Who was Wendy?", "turn_id": 21}], "answers": [{"span_start": 415, "span_end": 449, "span_text": " he never had proper fitting shoes", "input_text": "he never had proper fitting shoes", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 579, "span_end": 604, "span_text": "Auleva died when he was 5", "input_text": "Auleva", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 497, "span_end": 546, "span_text": "he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas", "input_text": "his adopted mother", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 645, "span_end": 685, "span_text": "raveled around seeking construction work", "input_text": "construction", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 550, "span_end": 571, "span_text": "Kalamazoo in Michigan", "input_text": "Kalamazoo", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 606, "span_end": 686, "span_text": "Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work.", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 757, "span_end": 784, "span_text": "Moving out on his own at 15", "input_text": "at age 15", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 840, "span_text": "Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants.", "input_text": "a waiter", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 953, "span_end": 988, "span_text": "A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders", "input_text": "a meeting with Harland Sanders", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1005, "span_end": 1060, "span_text": "career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant ", "input_text": "manager", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1065, "span_end": 1095, "span_text": "made him a millionaire in 1968", "input_text": "in 1968", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1137, "span_end": 1213, "span_text": "Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio", "input_text": "Columbus, Ohio", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1099, "span_end": 1106, "span_text": "In 1969", "input_text": "1969", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1412, "span_end": 1438, "span_text": "Thomas, married since 1954", "input_text": "1954", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1427, "span_end": 1450, "span_text": " since 1954 to Lorraine", "input_text": "Lorraine", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1465, "span_end": 1494, "span_text": "four grown kids besides Wendy", "input_text": "five", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1357, "span_end": 1411, "span_text": "Although troubled by his own experience with adoption,", "input_text": "no with adoption,", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1545, "span_end": 1595, "span_text": "He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption", "input_text": "the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1599, "span_end": 1603, "span_text": "1992", "input_text": "1992", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 24, "span_end": 50, "span_text": " who died at the age of 69", "input_text": "69", "turn_id": 20}, {"span_start": 147, "span_end": 185, "span_text": "hamburger chain named for his daughter", "input_text": "his daughter", "turn_id": 21}], "name": "high6938.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "30h4udglt2ixwhdt4aw72od3vwjpmy", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Jacob Abbott___Stuyvesant.txt/CHAPTER VIII_6d0c62805e96c1ad3990e429644d86d25ab4e03814d49b93f96e8ed", "story": "CHAPTER VIII. \n\nA DISCOVERY. \n\nWhile the boys were at work in this manner, Stuyvesant making his ladder, and Phonny his cage, they suddenly heard some one opening the door.

His military system, while it made no undue demands upon the people, provoked the admiration of Europe, and several important and successful industrial undertakings were due entirely to his instigation. Mr. Van Decht, fascinated by the climate, the primitive but delightful life, and a firm believer in the possibilities of the country, still lingered in the capital, and already the results of his large investments were beginning to be felt. Only a few people knew of the hidden danger which was ever brooding over the land--a danger which Ughtred had realized from the first, and which from the first he had set himself steadfastly to avert. A soldier himself, he knew something of the horrors of war. Nothing seemed to him more awful than the vision of this beautiful country blackened and devastated, her corn-fields soaked with blood, her pleasant pastoral life swept away in the grim struggle against an only partially-civilized enemy.

But \"the prize came a little late,\" said Xue Yongwu, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Journalism and Communication with Ocean University of China (OUC). There have been many accomplished writers of modern and contemporary literature in China, including Lu Xun, Ba Jin and Mao Dun, who should have won the prize earlier, he noted. China's splendid ancient literature, which extends thousands of years, has been widely acknowledged across the world. However, the contemporary literature failed to get enough recognition from outside the country due to its short history and complex political influences, he explained. Language has also been a barrier. Only a small proportion of Chinese literature has been translated into foreign languages, mainly English. The quality of some translated editions needs improvement, said Xue. \n\nIn addition to language skills, translation requires high-level comprehension and explanation of culture and art. It's hard for people without any literature background to produce a translation that fully reserves the aesthetic sense of the original version, according to Ren Dongsheng, professor with the College of Foreign Languages of OUC. The 57-year-old writer is known for his description of Chinese rural life. The settings for his works range from the 1911 revolution, Japan's invasion to Cultural Revolution. Mo combines hallucinatory realism with folk tales, which is more appealing to the taste of Western readers than the styles adopted by many of his peers, such as Yu Hua, Su Tong and Wang Shuo, said Zhang Hongsheng, dean of the Literature Department of the Communication University of China. \n\nHowever, \"Nobel Prize is not the unique standard to judge the achievements of a writer. Prizes presented by different organizations adopt various evaluation criteria,\" said Xu Yan, a literature critic. The quality of a literary work is always judged by the topic, language, structure, the way of story-telling, imagination and some other significant elements. People's tastes vary from different social background and cultural mechanism, she added. \n\nChinese contemporary literature, which appeared in 1949, has seen a trend of diversification since the country adopted the market economy in 1992. \"The prize is a positive sign that the West begins to recognize Chinese literature. But it's an acknowledgement of individual efforts, and Chinese literature revival still has a long way to go,\" said Zhang. Xue called upon Chinese writers to produce quality works with international perspectives. Good literature should reveal social problems and people's concerns while create the beauty of art. \"The society should provide favorable environment for the growth of Chinese writers,\" he stressed. Seeking increasing world attention requires Chinese writers to maintain the national characteristics and uniqueness. \"Chinese elements are the last to lose in successful writings,\" Zhang said. \n\nChina's book market has witnessed booming sales of Mo's masterpieces over the past days. Zhicheng Classic Bookstore, registered at T-Mall of China's largest online retailer Taobao.com, said 1,500 volumes of Mo's latest novel Frog were sold out in six hours after Mo won the prize. The store has received 1,200 reservation orders by 3:30 pm Friday. The book, about China's family-planning policy, also moved up to 14th from 560th on the list of the most populous book at the Amazon.cn withinin two days.

As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy. \n\nA term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]", "questions": [{"input_text": "What was the series of religious conflicts known as?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Between what religions?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which of those capped out at two million followers?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Was this the largest of the two religions?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How did it compare in size?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How many years did the conflict last?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Did it end with the Decree of Nantes?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many types of freedom did it grant?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the origin of the smaller religious sect?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Who do scholars think it may have been named after?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was that person actually a member of the larger religious sect?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What did he lead?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Was it named that because it wanted to split off from someone?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Who?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "In what main country were these religious sects in?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was the person who is possibly the namesake of the smaller sect from there?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What nation was he from?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Was the play on his surname flattering?", "turn_id": 19}], "answers": [{"span_start": 424, "span_end": 445, "span_text": " the Wars of Religion", "input_text": "the Wars of Religion", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 180, "span_end": 254, "span_text": "Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic", "input_text": "Huguenots and Catholics", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 8, "span_text": "Huguenot", "input_text": "Huguenot", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 57, "span_end": 61, "span_text": "1562", "input_text": "1562", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 128, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "about one-eighth the number of French Catholics", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 128, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "about one-eighth the number of French Catholics", "input_text": "about one-eighth the number of French Catholics", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 474, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "1562 to 1598", "input_text": "32", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 505, "span_end": 551, "span_text": "ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 593, "span_end": 626, "span_text": "religious, political and military", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 687, "span_end": 703, "span_text": " unclear origins", "input_text": "it is unclear", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_text": "unknown", "span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 11, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 1277, "span_end": 1300, "span_text": "Hugues, though Catholic", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1317, "span_end": 1341, "span_text": " the \"Confederate Party\"", "input_text": "the \"Confederate Party\"", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1360, "span_end": 1385, "span_text": " it favoured independence", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1391, "span_end": 1408, "span_text": "the Duke of Savoy", "input_text": "the Duke of Savoy", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1976, "span_end": 1982, "span_text": "France", "input_text": "France", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 799, "span_end": 832, "span_text": "Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues ", "input_text": "Sno", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 799, "span_end": 804, "span_text": "Swiss", "input_text": "Switzerland", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 933, "span_end": 947, "span_text": "derogatory pun", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 19}], "name": "HuguenotHuguenot_449937b867e3b41f9790d124b0d3571c382941684a918f7d75ec45fa"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3pjuzcgdj6gxj5vitkqrbgct7xk98s", "filename": "Propaganda.txt", "story": "Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.
